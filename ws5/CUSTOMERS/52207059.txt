While the high list price may scare the general reader from this work, it is a valuable research tool for anyone wishing to develop an in-depth interest in Grant.  Although a truly complete bibliography on Grant may be impossible to compile, Kelsey, as far as I can see, has come commendably close.  No matter what aspect of Grant's life you wish to study--his childhood, military career, Presidency, his Memoirs, etc.--you are sure to be steered to a plethora of citations, intelligently and frequently wittily annotated.<br /><br />A postscript:  I also appreciated Kelsey's pointed reference to Grant's \\"Alleged Alcohol Problem,\\" as well as her implied willingness to speak favorably of Grant's enigmatic mother, Hannah.  In the \\"Grant community\\" nowadays, doing these things seems to require some courage.  Good for her.
My review of Marks' previous Grant mystery, \\"The Ambush of My Name,\\" applies fully to this lame sequel, (if you've read one of these books, you've truly read them all,) so rather than repeat myself, I shall just say that this is not only one of the worst fictional portrayals of Grant and his wife, Julia, that I have ever read, but it's a truly feeble detective yarn, to boot.  I wish like crazy that Marks would either educate himself about the real Grants before he attempts another book in this series, or forget about USG altogether and turn to mangling the life of Franklin Pierce or Millard Fillmore or anyone else he pleases and leave poor Ulys alone.
The twenty-plus volumes comprising all the known extant writings of Ulysses Grant are indeed a remarkable example of published primary source material.  While every volume contains much material that is admittedly of trivial importance to even the most rabid Grant scholar, each book in this series also contains fascinating nuggets of information not found anywhere else.  Anyone with even a casual interest in USG is sure to discover something worth reading in every volume.  In gathering together not only all of Grant's known correspondence, but relevant peripheral documents, the editors of this series are doing a truly Herculean job and deserve great commendation.<br /><br />I have only a few quibbles with the series.  The first involves something over which the editors had no control.  I refer to the fact that, in the first few volumes (particularly Volume One,) Grant's descendants insisted that certain passages in Grant's letters to his fiancee-turned-wife Julia Dent that had been crossed out (either by Julia or other family members) not be published.  This idiotic decision is not only extremely frustrating for the reader, but, ironically, damaging to Grant himself.  By all accounts, the deleted passages contain nothing that could be considered detrimental to Grant's good name, but by leaving them out, these descendants unwittingly gave the impression that there was something to hide.  Hopefully, in an \\"Appendix\\" volume at the end of the series, the editors will be sporting enough to include whatever deleted passages can be transcribed, and the series will at last be considered complete.<br /><br />My other complaints about this series are more minor.  While each volume contains copious, and frequently illuminating, footnotes, the editors occasionally fail to provide enough context.  For instance, a brief, undetailed letter of Grant's will frequently be followed by several pages of footnotes providing other letters and documents on the same subject, without giving much information explaining what, exactly, it all meant.  The reader who is not already fully informed on the subject being addressed is sometimes left feeling confused about what exactly is being discussed, and what its relevance may have been.  In the \\"Calendar\\" section of miscellaneous material found in the back of each volume, letters and documents by, to, or related to Grant are also occasionally irritatingly cryptic and mysterious.<br /><br />Another drawback is, simply, the price.  While these books are certainly handsomely--and obviously expensively--printed and bound, those of us who study history as a hobby rather than as a profession could wish for editions that were more cheaply done, and thus more affordable.  Unless you are fortunate enough to have access to a good academic library, these extremely expensive (even when you buy second-hand) volumes are simply out-of-reach for many people.  That's a great pity, because in these books is an \\"insider's view\\" of Grant that does not fully come across in any regular biography.out giving much information explaining what, exactly, it all meant.

The unsolved murder of William Desmond Taylor is a striking and unusual case, in the sense that Taylor's still-mysterious life was perhaps even stranger than his death.  I don't believe I've ever read of a homicide where there are so many bizarre characters involved, and so many contradictory, missing, outlandish, and disputed pieces to the puzzle surrounding this enigmatic antique dealer-turned runaway spouse-turned vagabond-turned actor-turned director.  I have yet to read one account of the case that does not directly clash with all the others.<br /><br />Unfortunately, Charles Higham has done nothing at all to clarify, let alone solve, this frustrating homicide.  I am amazed that his publishers allowed such a muddled, weak book to go to press.  He simply launches the book with an assumption of who the guilty party was, gives a glib \\"solution\\" to the murder based on what he airily calls \\"circumstantial evidence\\" (evidence that he never sees fit to share with his readers,) and, essentially, forces his audience to just take his word for it that this is what happened.  While I can't dispute that it's possible the murder unfolded as he claims, on the other hand, Higham gives us no proof whatsoever that it did.  The rambling and irrelevant digressions noted by previous reviewers are, I think, simply necessary padding to cover up the fact that his case against his prime suspect could be summed up in two or three lines.<br /><br />Higham also has the annoying habit of dropping in little bombshells without providing any elaboration or even evidence of his claims.  He says former DA Buron Fitts may well have shot himself using the gun used to murder Taylor.  How does he know?  He claims his alleged murderer made a \\"deathbed confession\\" to a nurse, who subsequently disappeared.  Where did this story come from?  Much of Higham's book is based on an unpublished memoir allegedly written by a now-dead man, which claims he had a long affair with Taylor.  Is this memoir at all accurate?  Corroborated by any other accounts?  Or could it be fraudulent?  If Higham bothered to find answers to these questions, he kept that to himself.<br /><br />All in all, this book was a most irritating read.all accurate?  Corroborated by any other accounts?

One of the things that makes Laura Levine my favorite among the newer crop of mystery writers is that her books not only have a happy ending, but a happy beginning:  The person she bumps off always richly deserves it.  This latest volume in Levine's Jaime Austen series is no exception, as the ever-beleaguered heroine's current nemesis discovers that the phrase \\"killer pair of shoes\\" can take on a whole new meaning, and the reader is drawn into a highly entertaining, witty whodunit.<br /><br />Levine is a consistently lively, clever, and hilariously funny author, and I can unreservedly recommend this book to anyone looking for summer reading material--whether you are normally a fan of detective fiction or not.<br /><br />I recommend, however, reading this book wearing flat-heeled slippers.  Your designer stilettos will never look the same to you again.

The twenty-six (and counting!) volumes comprising all the known extant writings of Ulysses Grant are indeed a remarkable example of published primary source material.  While every volume contains much material that is admittedly of trivial importance to even the most rabid Grant scholar, each book in this series also contains fascinating nuggets of information not found anywhere else.  Anyone with even a casual interest in USG is sure to discover something worth reading in every volume.  In gathering together not only all of Grant's known correspondence, but relevant peripheral documents, the editors of this series are doing a truly Herculean job and deserve great commendation.<br /><br />I have only a few quibbles with the series.  The first involves something over which the editors had no control.  I refer to the fact that, in the first few volumes (particularly Volume One,) Grant's descendants insisted that certain passages in Grant's letters to his fiancee-turned-wife Julia Dent that had been crossed out (either by Julia or other family members) not be published.  This idiotic decision is not only extremely frustrating for the reader, but, ironically, damaging to Grant himself.  By all accounts, the deleted passages contain nothing that could be considered detrimental to Grant's good name, but by leaving them out, these descendants unwittingly gave the impression that there was something to hide.  Hopefully, in an \\"Appendix\\" volume at the end of the series, the editors will be sporting enough to include whatever deleted passages can be transcribed, and the series will at last be considered complete.<br /><br />My other complaints about this series are more minor.  While each volume contains copious, and frequently illuminating, footnotes, the editors occasionally fail to provide enough context.  That is to say, a brief, undetailed letter of Grant's will frequently be followed by several pages of footnotes providing other letters and documents on the same subject, without giving much information explaining what, exactly, it all meant.

The twenty-six (and counting!) volumes comprising all the known extant writings of Ulysses Grant are indeed a remarkable example of published primary source material.  While every volume contains much material that is admittedly of trivial importance to even the most rabid Grant scholar, each book in this series also contains fascinating nuggets of information not found anywhere else.  Anyone with even a casual interest in USG is sure to discover something worth reading in every volume.  In gathering together not only all of Grant's known correspondence, but relevant peripheral documents, the editors of this series are doing a truly Herculean job and deserve great commendation.<br /><br />I have only a few quibbles with the series.  The first involves something over which the editors had no control.  I refer to the fact that, in the first few volumes (particularly Volume One,) Grant's descendants insisted that certain passages in Grant's letters to his fiancee-turned-wife Julia Dent that had been crossed out (either by Julia or other family members) not be published.  This idiotic decision is not only extremely frustrating for the reader, but, ironically, damaging to Grant himself.  By all accounts, the deleted passages contain nothing that could be considered detrimental to Grant's good name, but by leaving them out, these descendants unwittingly gave the impression that there was something to hide.  Hopefully, in an \\"Appendix\\" volume at the end of the series, the editors will be sporting enough to include whatever deleted passages can be transcribed, and the series will at last be considered complete.<br /><br />My other complaints about this series are more minor.  While each volume contains copious, and frequently illuminating, footnotes, the editors occasionally fail to provide enough context.  That is to say, a brief, undetailed letter of Grant's will frequently be followed by several pages of footnotes providing other letters and documents on the same subject, without giving much information explaining what, exactly, it all meant.  The reader who is not already fully informed on the subject being addressed is sometimes left feeling confused about what exactly is being discussed, and what its relevance may have been.<br /><br />Another drawback is, simply, the price.

If the name \\"Ulysses S. Grant\\" means nothing to you other than \\"that bearded dude on the fifty dollar bill,\\" this book might serve as a decent enough \\"introductory\\" volume.  Otherwise, it is nothing more than yet another dismal waste of dead trees.  The author (working, I assume, under an extremely short publishing deadline,) merely spliced together material from older, weightier books on Grant and the Civil War--and I'd be shocked to learn that he bothered to read any of those books more than once.<br /><br />Call me finicky, but when did original research and intellectual curiosity become unfashionable in historical circles?  I am not a professional historian, but even I am aware that there is a wealth of unpublished and/or ignored primary source material on Grant's personality and career, just begging to be mined.  Why do so many writers instead settle for cranking out lazy retreads of the same old books?<br /><br />Let me add another, admittedly less significant complaint--this is yet another Grant book that features one seriously ugly cover.  Why is it that the covers of so many recent books about an attractive man like Ulysses Grant perversely display pictures that make him look like a dyspeptic werewolf?
The fatal poisoning of Charles Bravo is a classic historical mystery, and rightfully so.  The case's unique fascination lies with its strange cast of characters, featuring someone who was among the most unsympathetic victims in the annals of crime (as Ruddick notes, Bravo \\"was the sort of man to whom your mind would instinctively turn when you were told that someone had been expelled from your club for cheating at cards,\\") and with the extremely narrow list of suspects.  Practically speaking, there were only two people in the world who could be said to have the means, motive, and opportunity to poison Bravo, but no evidence has ever been uncovered to prove the guilt of either party.<br /><br />While Ruddick's book is a nicely researched and well-written account of the death of Charles Bravo, it is not nearly as definitive as he thinks.  The \\"new evidence\\" that he so proudly features in his book has already appeared in print, notably in Yseult Bridges' 1956 study \\"How Charles Bravo Died,\\" a book that Ruddick cites but does not seem to have actually read.  Bridges centered her book around the peculiar personality of the victim, not of the accepted suspects, and in the process devised what is still the most original and intriguing solution to the mystery.  It would have been interesting to have Ruddick address Bridges' theories, particularly as he and Bridges had completely different interpretations of cryptic, and probably crucial, conversations that Bravo's new wife, Florence, had with her doctor.<br /><br />While Ruddick certainly presents a plausible theory of Bravo's death, I finished the book with the feeling that the last chapter to this tale has yet to be written.
Forget Antonia Fraser, Alison Weir, and their sorry ilk; this hundred-year-old work still ranks as perhaps the most definitive biography of this most controversial of Queens to date.  Henderson's work remains valuable because, unlike virtually every book to date about Mary Stewart (including John Guy's admirable recent bio,) the author manages to remain coolly objective.  He comes neither to praise Mary nor bury her, although in the process he manages to do a judicious amount of both.  In addition to this unusual lack of partisanship, his biography is solidly-researched, factually accurate, insightful, and well written.  (As a bonus, Henderson is also very funny at times.)<br /><br />The one major flaw in the book is Henderson's cavalier treatment of the death of Mary's notorious second husband, Henry, Lord Darnley.  Here, his usual common sense and restraint seem to utterly desert him.  Perhaps overwhelmed by the sheer murky complexity of the crime (despite over four hundred years of effort by numberless historians, Darnley's demise still ranks as one of history's most stubbornly baffling unsolved murders,) Henderson really fails to even try and explain Kirk o'Field at all, retreating into vaguely muttering a recap of the most absurd contemporary efforts to frame Mary and the Earl of Bothwell for the slaying.<br /><br />When a reputable historian finds himself relying on George Buchanan for source material, you know he's in big trouble.<br /><br />I also wish Henderson had spent more time analyzing the Casket Letters in the main body of his biography, but I suppose that, having already devoted an entire book to the subject (the indispensable \\"Mary Queen of Scots and the Casket Letters,\\") he felt he had said his fill on the matter.  He compensates, however, by including an appendix where he gleefully tears into Andrew Lang's famously indecisive book about the letters (\\"The Mystery of Mary Stuart,\\" a work where Lang seemed to come to a different conclusion about their authenticity with each successive edition.)  While this essay is one of the most hilarious historical Fiskings I've ever read, you can't help but squirm while he takes on poor Lang.  It's a bit like watching Godzilla going through Tokyo.<br /><br />This book is one of the relatively few \\"must-reads\\" for anyone interested in the human puzzle that was Mary Queen of Scots.out their authenticity with each successive edition.)

The seventeenth-century French humorist Paul Scarron is one of comic literature's most likable figures, and certainly one of the strangest.  As a handsome, outgoing bon vivant of only twenty-eight, he was first stricken with a disease--now believed to be a particularly virulent form of rheumatoid arthritis--that, long before his death at the age of fifty, left him a deformed, emaciated invalid, in near-constant pain and so paralyzed he could scarcely move even his fingers.  The amazing thing is that through his long torment, he made himself famous, not only for his personal wit and charm, but for creating satiric verses, plays, and one unfinished novel--the \\"Comical Romance\\"--that made him a popular and influential artist, not just on the Continent, but in England as well.  The only literary feat I know of that comes even close to Scarron's achievement is Ulysses S. Grant's successful effort at writing his memoirs while dying of throat cancer.<br /><br />I began reading the \\"Comical Romance\\" simply out of curiosity after reading something of Scarron's life in a biography of Madame de Maintenon (many years before she became Louis XIV's morganatic wife, she was wed to Scarron--an odd and touching union that is quite a story all by itself.)  However, I finished it out of sheer enjoyment of the work.  While the novel--a long, rambling tale loosely built around the adventures of a touring theatrical company--obviously belongs to a world long foreign to us, much of the humor is surprisingly modern, and the entire story is told with a zest and good-natured charm that shows what an engaging personality the author must have been.<br /><br />Hey, no matter what century you live in, how can one not warm to an author who, midway through his story, warns the reader not to go any further if they are bored?
This is one of the more well-known early Grant biographies, but it is not of great interest, as it states little that can't be found in a score of other nineteenth-century books about the General.  Also, the book is written in an irritatingly vague and awkward style, which is surprising considering that Church is best-known as a successful magazine editor.<br /><br />Its most notable features spring from the author himself.  Throughout the text, he intimates a much greater personal familiarity with Grant than he probably possessed (a not-uncommon habit among USG's contemporaries,) which brings in doubt the reliability of certain otherwise unauthenticated--and uncharacteristic--statements Church attributed to Grant.  Also, a section that describes a brief relationship Grant had in his youth with a girl named Kate Lowe is virtually identical in wording with a passage about Lowe found in Hamlin Garland's \\"Ulysses S. Grant, His Life and Character.\\"<br /><br />Either Church or Garland shamelessly plagarized from the other's work, but I am not sure who is the guilty party.  Church's book was published in 1897, Garland's in 1898, but a serialization of Garland's book appeared in McClure's magazine beginning in Dec. 1896, so if Garland's material about Lowe appeared in the magazine, it seems that Church would be the \\"borrower\\" here.  I have not read the magazine serial, however, so I cannot say if that was the case.  If any reader of this review is familiar with the McClure's articles, perhaps they could clarify the matter.<br /><br />It might seem odd that I spend so much space discussing this minor bit of pilfering, but believe me, it is the most interesting part of this otherwise dry book.
Calling Edmund Pearson a \\"true-crime\\" writer is rather like describing Dom Perignon as a cheap bit of fizz.  Like his Scottish contemporary William Roughead, Pearson was a talented writer with a dry wit and pleasantly off-kilter personality, who transcended his strange subject matter to produce remarkably entertaining, usually insightful social commentary.  Although both these authors had no pretensions to do anything other than entertain themselves and their readers (in that order, probably,) they make admirable historians.<br /><br />\\"Murder At Smutty Nose,\\" is a fine representative collection of Pearson's work.  The title essay , which chronicles a multiple murder on a lonely island, and \\"The Sixth Capsule,\\" detailing the poisoning of an unwanted secret wife, are memorable examples of how banal utter cruelty and selfishness can be.  On the other hand, \\"A Demnition Body,\\" and \\"Number 31 Bond Street,\\" are about as farcical as violent death can possibly be.  \\"Number 31,\\" in particular, with its bizarre cast of characters and a heroine prone to faking pregnancies--complete with borrowed baby--for inheritance purposes (\\"Don't touch my dear baby--this is the child of Harvey Burdell!\\") describes a still-unsolved mystery that no novelist would dare invent.<br /><br />However, Pearson's treatment of Constance Kent (convicted of murdering her infant brother in 1860,) and Lizzie Borden (the author's pet obsession throughout his career,) reveal his chief failing as a crime historian:  Intellectual rigidity.  He was too apt to take a conventional view of criminal cases--namely, that the accused was always guilty--and he seldom kept his mind open to other solutions.  (This is particularly unfortunate in the Kent case, which was far more complex and unresolved than Pearson ever acknowledged.)<br /><br />This is a minor failing, however, and it should not keep anyone interested in social history--or who simply wants to read a good mystery--from giving Pearson's works a try.
What a shock to see I'm not the only one who remembers this anthology as one of THE books from childhood days!  I first read this book when I was eight years old, and had such fond memories of it that when I recently stumbled across a copy in my local library, I had to look through it again.  I was amazed to find that it had lost none of its appeal for me in adulthood.<br /><br />The reason for its unjustified obscurity, I believe, is that it was originally marketed as a \\"kids' book\\" (I found this in the \\"Children's section\\" of the library,) thus giving adults the impression that it is not for them.  What a mistake.  Although all the stories here feature young people, it is hardly juvenile in tone.<br /><br />I note many of the previous reviewers have stated that this was the book that \\"turned them on\\" to science fiction.  I differ here, because I am actually not usually much of a fan of the genre, which just emphasizes the value of this collection.  These are not just great sci-fi stories, they are great STORIES, period.<br /><br />I'm also stunned to see from these earlier reviews that this wonderful book is now so obscure.  How dumb have publishers gotten these days?
This novel--intended as part of a strange effort to turn Ulysses Grant into Nancy Drew with a beard--has nothing to offer fans of either USG or Agatha Christie.  It is hilariously inaccurate, and Marks couldn't even be bothered to learn the first thing about the real historical figures he writes about--his Grant is a henpecked, wimpy doofus who would never have lasted two minutes against Robert E. Lee (or Mary Custis Lee, for that matter,) and his adoring wife Julia is, for reasons best known to the author, portrayed as Hillary Clinton in hoops.  Marks could not have created a more misleading portrait of those two if he had tried.<br /><br />I perhaps could have forgiven all this if the author had at least created an engaging work of fiction, but he did not.  The book is remarkably dull and shallow, with a plot he must have spent a whole 45 seconds concocting.  It is at times like this that I wish Amazon allowed reviewers to rate a book with minus points.
Given the remarkable material a historian is given to work with, it is difficult to write a bad biography of anyone connected with the reign of Louis XIV, but Ms. Hilton decided to give it her best shot.  I am not surprised to discover that this book was written by a twenty-six year old, because the author's genuine potential as a writer and researcher are greatly flawed by an irritatingly shallow assessment of her subject.  Hilton is so enamored of La Montespan's beauty and glamour that she blithely glosses over the Royal Mistress' many and disturbing character flaws (a probable bent towards Satanism being only the most famous of them,) gives her a quite unwarranted importance in the development of her lover's reign, and denigrates all her female rivals (notably Madame de Maintenon) in a way that comes off as positively childish.<br /><br />(Who was it that said, \\"It's always tempting to impute/Unlikely virtues to the cute\\"?)<br /><br />Hilton is at the beginning of her career, however, and I do think she may well have better work ahead of her as she matures.  While this is certainly a promising debut, I have the suspicion she'll be a little embarrassed by this book in twenty years or so.  I hope that is the case, anyway.
This book depressed me.  Korda (or, more likely, his flunkies) put together a truly slap-dash book, which reads like he spent a brief lunch-break \\"researching\\" this work, and another one in writing it.  Judging by his footnotes, Korda relied on a couple of Internet sites and two books for his information:  William McFeely's 1981 biography, a, to put it mildly, controversial piece of work, and W.E. Woodward's notorious \\"Meet General Grant,\\" now widely--and correctly--regarded as the worst, most misleading biography about Ulysses S. Grant ever written.  (Even more strangely, Korda explains his curious taste in source material by declaring that \\"Writing in 1928, Woodward was closer to Grant's time...\\"  Going by that logic, I assume that Mr. Korda believes that \\"Birth of a Nation\\" is the definitive film about 19th-century America.)<br /><br />I don't know what else to say at this point, other than that I am truly tired of books like this.  I am tired of \\"pop\\" history works which are shallow, uninteresting, repetitive, strewn with glaringly silly inaccuracies, and aimed at the lowest common denominator.  I am tired of authors who do only the most casual research and then have the nerve to consider themselves worthy of adding to the body of knowledge about a historical figure.  I am tired of publishing houses who obviously consider concepts like originality, insight, and effort to be four-letter words.  This is a trend that seems to be getting worse, not better, in recent years.  And the general dumbing-down of the world continues apace.
John Noone deserves much credit for originality.  His proposed solution to the riddle of the \\"Masked Man\\" is, without a doubt, the most ingenious (and darkly hilarious) theory to date.  Like all the earlier \\"solutions\\" to the riddle of this unfortunate man's identity, his theory is based largely on conjecture, but the tale he spins is so outrageous and unexpected it is, curiously, the most convincing answer yet.  I would love to see other \\"Maskologists\\" do their own research into Noone's theory to see if it could be either strengthened or refuted.<br /><br />Whether you personally find his conclusions compelling or not, the background information Noone relates, with its many peculiar twists and turns (such as the stories of the still-mysterious \\"James de la Cloche\\" and France's most unwelcome dinner guest, the Marquise de Brinvilliers,) make lively reading for anyone interested in history's more dark and perverse corners.
The popular new literary trend of the \\"funny murder mystery\\" is a trickier genre than it seems.  All too often, such novels are either not comedic enough to be funny or not mystifying enough to be mysterious.  Or both.  Laura Levine is one of the few authors in this field who has a skillful grasp of both elements of her story.  \\"Killer Blonde,\\" like her previous novels, delivers not only a sharp, breezy wit, but an involving \\"whodunit\\" as well.  SueEllen Kingsley, the successful gold-digger with \\"flotation devices\\" for a chest, a heart of lead, and a brain to match, is a scarily, hilariously memorable character, and there is not a boring line to be found in heroine Jaine Austen's efforts to find her killer.  Highly recommended!
I was a bit surprised to see that this book is being reprinted.  While it is better than most of the hack-work biographies of Grant that were rushed into the marketplace to capitalize on his much-publicized illness and death, that's not saying much.  It is a competent book, written with a bit more flair than most of the early books about USG, but it offers little to the serious student of his life and times.<br /><br />The truly embarrassing part of the book comes courtesy of Otis Tiffany, a Methodist minister who \\"wrote\\" the latter part of this work.  Tiffany knew Grant, but not nearly as well as he implied.  In describing USG's last years, he resorts to such tricks as copying--verbatim--paragraphs from the New York Times' articles about Grant (thus inadvertently illustrating how scanty his personal knowledge about the General truly was.) Tiffany also advances the strange (and, to modern ears, frankly creepy) assertion that the one true love of Grant's life was not his wife, Julia, or his three sons, but his daughter, Nellie. Grant undoubtedly greatly loved the girl (perhaps too much so, as Nellie grew into a spoiled, self-obsessed dolt,) but to imply that the rest of his family meant little to Grant in comparison is almost insultingly off-base.<br /><br />While this book is not a total waste of paper, at such times it comes darn close.
Although this was published several years ago, it seems to have quickly slipped into the obscurity it so richly deserves, so I have only now discovered it.  And I sincerely wish I hadn't. This strange, sick novel is not only the worst Grant book I have ever heard of (it makes Jeffrey Marks' pathetic mystery novels look like classics of modern literature,) it may possibly be the worst novel I have ever read, period.<br />For reasons only Sauers can explain, she has chosen to deliberately trash Grant in this novel, depicting him not only as a drunk, but as a cad and creep who bears as much resemblance to the real USG as Mother Teresa does to Paris Hilton.  The novel is, as far as I can tell (the author's style is extremely incoherent,) a dialogue between Grant's ghost and his \\"spirit guide,\\" who points out to him the various ways he screwed up his life.<br />And what a life it was!  According to Sauers, Grant not only cheated on his wife, Julia, pracically non-stop throughout their marriage (!), he sexually molested a young male servant of his (!!), and, just for good measure, was such a terrible parent that he allowed his son, Fred, to be molested by a drunken soldier (!!!)<br />Need I say more?  I can't explain what inspired Sauers to write such nonsense (let alone what inspired anyone to publish it,) but I can only say--I'm quite serious here--the book reads like the product of an extremely disturbed mind.  Avoiding this book shouldn't be too difficult, but if it happens to cross your path, I can't say how strongly I believe it should be ignored.<br />No, I can't say I liked this book much.
This odd, gossipy memoir has its flaws, but for anyone interested in Grant's personal side, this is a valuable look at his post-Civil War life.  Badeau was a longtime aide of Grant's, and he gives much \\"inside information\\" dealing with Grant's postwar political career, as well as his private side, that is occasionally insightful and almost always entertaining.  (His anecdote about Grant and his wife Julia on a Swiss train is by itself worth the price of the book.)<br /><br />The book has two main flaws.  The first is that Badeau is simply a terrible writer.  He is fond of using about three times the number of necessary words, which makes his style frequently tedious to plow through.  The second, much more significant, drawback is that while Badeau knew Grant well, it is obvious that he did not know him nearly as well as he thought he did.  Many of his comments about Grant's character are discerning, but many more are simply the product of Badeau's slightly arrogant assumption of personal familiarity with the workings of Grant's inner mind--a familiarity that clearly existed only to a very limited extent.<br /><br />Even with these drawbacks, however, I enjoyed the book and I recommend it for anyone curious about Grant's civilian years.
This is probably the bravest Grant book ever written.  Even those biographers favorable to him have a tendency, like so many sheep, to parrot the same old lines about him as the bumbling, inept politician who presided over one of the most corrupt administrations is American history.  It does not seem to bother these historians that they are, for the most part, simply repeating partisan attacks that had been made against him by his political enemies for their own questionable (to say the least) reasons.<br />Frank Scaturro is the first writer I have ever seen to use a fresh approach to the Grant presidency, pointing out not only that the much touted scandals of his term in office were frequently based on weak or exaggerated evidence, but that Grant himself was a strong, enlightened leader who accomplished more than most want to admit.  It seems that the victor of Vicksburg and Appomattox was not all that different from the man who occupied the White House, after all.<br />This book is highly recommended for anyone who wants to hear &quot;the other side of the story&quot; of Grant's oft-belittled political career.
It is a great mystery to me why there has yet to appear a truly satisfactory biography of Ulysses S. Grant.  Here is someone who was probably the most famous and admired man of his time, he had an incredibly varied and interesting life, culminating in one of the most dramatic and well-publicized deaths ever recorded, and heaven knows, there is no lack of source material for historians to draw upon.  So, why, over a century since his demise, is Grant more misunderstood and generally ill-treated by history than when he was alive?  I can only surmise that he was too deep a character, and his life far too complicated, for our rather shallow modern biographers to truly do him justice.  What Grant needs is a Hume or Froude to step in and rescue his memory.<br />Unfortunately, he fails to find one in Jean Smith.  Smith does a relatively decent job of covering Grant's public career.  He describes his war efforts well enough--at least to this non-military historian--and his section on Grant's shockingly underrated Presidency is a welcome bit of revisionism.  It's easily the best part of the book.<br />Where he fails is in his treatment of Grant's civilian years--which was, to me, the most interesting part of his life.  Smith delivers a casual, surface treatment of Grant's private life--even his last year, where he held off an impending death by sheer willpower in order to complete his memoirs and provide for his soon-to-be widow, is rushed through hurriedly, as though Smith had wearied of his project and wished to simply get it over with.<br />Further evidence that large parts of the book feel like a rush-job comes from the occasional word-for-word remarks \\"borrowed\\" from authors like Lloyd Lewis and William McFeely.  Such (...) comments are jarring, and deepen the impression that Smith just did not put much mental effort into much of his work.<br />In short, the book is a useful, quite readable introductory volume for anyone who knows nothing about Grant and wishes to learn more, but little more.  Pity.more, but little more.  Pity.
Over a hundred years since it was first published, this is still one of the premier biographies of Grant.  Whether that is a tribute to the superior merits of this book or the weaknesses of modern Grant scholarship is an interesting question.  The value of Garland's book lies in the many interviews he conducted with people who knew Grant best, particularly his wife and sons.  This generous use of first-person narratives scattered throughout the book has both pluses and minuses.  While the universal faultiness of human memory has to be carefully considered when reading these recollections (some of which describe events that took place more than sixty years before Garland interviewed them,) there is nothing more biographically interesting than reading accounts of a person's life given by those who actually saw this life unfold.  In fact, it's a pity no historian has thought to publish a book consisting only of the full texts of these many interviews Garland conducted, as the ultimate oral history of Grant.  With proper annotation, it would probably be the finest book about him yet.<br /><br />One of my main gripes with this book--other than the caveat about the uncertainty that always surrounds old memories of the past--is Garland's writing style.  I have never read any of his other works, but I am aware that he was a popular novelist in his day, and still commands a substantial cult following.  This surprises me a little, because I find his prose style tends to alternate between leaden clunkiness and a prim sappiness (\\"There is a whisper to be heard, also, of a little maid living in those days whose face and voice had come to be very precious to Ulysses...\\")  Such absurdly florid lines strongly suggest that at times Garland forgot that he wasn't writing one of his novels.  Another drawback is that the book would have greatly benefited from footnotes--or, at least, more clues from Garland about which of his sources gave him what information.<br /><br />Also, rather startlingly, the section where Garland writes about Kate Lowe, a girl Grant knew when he was a West Point cadet, is plagarized from William Conant Church's 1897 biography!  (Or did Church steal from Garland?  Doris Kearns Goodwin, come home.  All is forgiven!)<br /><br />All in all, however, it's still a book well worth reading for anyone with an interest in Grant--or anyone who wishes to develop one.ection where Garland writes about Kate Lowe, a girl Grant knew when he was a West Point cadet, is plagarized from William Conant Church's 1897 biography!

I'm really not sure why this was published.  The collection of photos (which, one would think, is the main point of the book) is pretty uninteresting, and the essays only prove that McFeely hasn't learned any more about Grant since he wrote that overrated bio over twenty years ago.<br />Some may enjoy reading the author shoot from the hip all throughout the book, but, personally, I would prefer reading interpretations of Grant that are based on actual sources.  Most of McFeely's conclusions seem to be based on his own rather odd fantasies and hypotheses--which is why he rarely bothers to provide evidence for his statements.  This can be interesting at times, but it usually comes off as simply annoying.  There are times when he resembles Geoffrey Perret with a better editor.  In short, if you liked his previous book on Grant, you'll be in heaven over this item.  If not...well, best save your money.<br />P.S.  And Julia Grant was not a silly woman.  Unusual, undoubtedly yes.  (God bless the woman, I think that's a large part of why I like her so much.)  But silly, no.  There IS a difference.
There is no other way of putting it:  I found this book perfectly appalling.  I had thought that Geoffrey Perret's biography of Grant was the last word in historical sloppiness, but the Andersons have managed to wrest that dubious prize from his fingers.  I am not a Lee expert, so I cannot say how accurate that section of this book is, but their chapters dealing with Grant are a joke.  (And why is it that both the Andersons and Perret felt the need to include snide attacks on Grant's wife, Julia?  Although the woman was undoubtedly no beauty, she was, by all accounts, a perfectly delightful person who was a warm, loving, and immensely supportive spouse to her oft-troubled husband.  When did it become popular among third-rate historians to slander her?)<br />This book is so ludicrously inaccurate and fanciful that I would be amused if it were not for the fact that many unwitting readers are obviously led to unquestioningly accept this mishmash.  Even a certain web site devoted to Grant has, I noticed, adopted a couple of this book's weirder claims (such as the bizarre, and completely fictional, idea that Julia accused Grant of adultery during the two years he spent on the West Coast,) and presented it as fact.  It is frightening how much damage an inaccurate biography can do to the historical record.<br />Avoid this book at all costs!
When I first discovered the existence of this volume, I was frankly puzzled.  Why reissue the dullest Grant book this side of Adam Badeau's &quot;Military History&quot;?  Having read this abridgment, I am still pondering the strange ways of publishers.  The editing on this book seems to have been done virtually at random--many of the few interesting anecdotes in Young's book have disappeared, while pages and pages of tedium remain in all their original glory.<br />The book's main selling point--the &quot;Table talk&quot; or informal interviews Young conducted with Grant--are mildly interesting in spots, but are not, on the whole, valuable enough to justify this new edition, particularly since Young's original two volumes are readily available at most libraries and on the internet's various used bookstores.  Instead of wasting their time on such a relatively common and uninteresting work, I wish the publishers had turned their attention to reissuing more compelling old books on Grant that are less readily available.
A couple of these previous reviewers who expressed disappointment that this second novel in Laura Levine's Jaine Austen series is not Arthur Conan Doyle missed the point:  It's not meant to be.  This breezy mystery is more of a showcase for Levine's cheerful, unpretentious humor and engaging characters than a traditional whodunit, and I appreciate the innovation.  I found &quot;Last Writes,&quot; in fact, to be pleasantly reminiscent of P.G. Wodehouse's Hollywood-studio-themed stories.  Like her previous mystery novel, this makes for witty, enjoyable summer escapism, and I look forward to reading more of the same!
This is one seriously irritating book.  There may be relatively few factual errors (at least, compared to Geoffrey Perret's work on Grant, a masterpiece of unintentional humor,) but McFeely's work is riddled with what I can only believe are deliberately insulting mischaracterizations and misrepresentations, tiresomely pretentious writing, and amateur psychoanalyzing of the most obnoxious sort.  McFeely is particularly fond of quoting the words of Grant or his wife on some matter or another, and then proclaiming that--no matter how clear their meaning may have been to us poor dumb non-historians--what they were REALLY saying and thinking was something else altogether.  If there is anything I can't abide, it's a biographer who persists in reading a subject's mind and putting words into his or her mouth and thoughts into his or her head that were never said and never thought.  McFeely not only obviously believes he is much smarter than Grant (hah!) but more percipient than his readership, as well.<br />If this book is worthy of a Pulitzer, then I trust my next grocery shopping list will earn me a Nobel Prize for Literature.
This book is truly an astonishing piece of work.  Considering its grotesque factual errors and bizarre misreadings of source material (more than I have ever seen in a single work of non-fiction,) the pompous writing style, the author's grating tendency to make childishly snide (and irrelevant) side comments, and--most bafflingly--the remarkable hatchet-job he does on Grant's wife Julia, I think I can state unhesitatingly that this is the most thoroughly unprofessional biography of anyone I have ever read.  I find myself genuinely baffled that Perret evidently still has a career as a historian.<br />As appalled as I am by the thought that readers who had no prior knowledge about Grant will be led to take some of this tripe seriously, I am even more stunned by reviewers who state unblushingly that Perret's allergy to accuracy does not matter, as long as he is pro-Grant and writes in what is, to them, an appealing writing style!  There are few people who defend Grant more wholeheartedly than I do (hey, I even maintain he was a pretty good President,) but I believe that a bad defense of USG can, in the long run, be as damaging to his reputation as no defense at all.  My advice to Grant neophytes?  Read the man's own words, in his acclaimed memoirs and fascinating private letters, as well as first person accounts like &quot;Campaigning With Grant,&quot; and give this silliness a wide berth.<br />And those cracks of his about Julia REALLY set my teeth on edge.
&quot;Captain Sam Grant&quot; must rank with William McFeely's &quot;Grant&quot; and Brooks Simpson's &quot;Triumph Over Adversity&quot; as the most overrated USG biographies ever written.  This look at Grant's pre-Civil War years simply is not as accurate and reliable as some previous reviewers would have us believe.  Lewis frequently makes assertions without providing adequate evidence for these statements, and he occasionally cites dubious or discredited sources.  The book, in many places, reads more like an speculative historical novel than a serious academic study.  Also, in my opinion, Lewis spends way too much time on the Mexican war.<br />That said, it is not without virtues.  It is engaging and, in its folksy way, well written.  Lewis' portrait of Grant's quietly complicated character generally rings true.  The book is an enjoyable read, as long as the reader does not expect too much.
Let me say from the outset that I strongly disagree with Weir's take on the Darnley murder (I also believe that Mary was innocent, but I maintain that Bothwell was not guilty as well,) and reading her book has done nothing to sway my views.  Weir's latest is a non-effort, a slap-dash cut-and-paste job featuring paraphrased excerpts from Fraser's \\"Mary Queen of Scots,\\" Davison's \\"The Casket Letters,\\" and Mahon's \\"The Tragedy of Kirk o'Field.\\"  The only thing original about this book are the bizarre factual errors and deliriously silly conclusions one has come to expect from this \\"writer.\\"  (Doesn't anyone at her publishing house bother to even proofread her books before they're released?)<br />In short--those interested in Mary should save their money and instead look for a secondhand copy of Elizabeth Byrd's excellent novel \\"Immortal Queen.\\"  Byrd's work may be fiction, but it is more grounded in reality than anything Weir has ever written.
&quot;This Pen For Hire&quot; is a mystery novel for everyone who has become bored with mystery novels, as it (if I may be pardoned the choice of words) brings fresh blood into an increasingly tired and cliche-ridden genre.  Laura Levine's mixture of irreverent humor and a fast-paced, cleverly plotted storyline enables the book to stand as both a spoof and a celebration of the traditional whodunit.  I am definitely looking forward to reading more from this delightfully talented author!
Although it is a work of fiction that was first published nearly fifty years ago, &quot;Immortal Queen&quot; still ranks as arguably the finest book ever written on the controversial Mary Queen of Scots.  The novel is beautifully written and better researched than most biographies, but what truly makes this book such a classic is Byrd's insight into Mary's enigmatic personality.  The psychological portraits of Mary and her star-crossed soul mate, the Earl of Bothwell, are the most fascinating and plausible ever written, and illustrate the Scottish Queen and her times better than a boatload of Antonia Frasers could ever hope to do.  For anyone who wonders what Mary &quot;was really like,&quot; this is the book to read!
This novel covers the last days of Ulysses S. Grant, interspersed with Grant's &quot;flashbacks&quot; to the Civil War.  The author relies too heavily on exposition to tell his story (one chapter where Grant and his wife tell each other virtually his whole life story is particularly awkward,) and the ending somehow manages to be both flat and overly melodramatic.  However, parts of the book (particularly the depiction of Shiloh) are genuinely moving.  This is hardly a memorable novel--I doubt I'll read it twice--but it is not a complete waste of time, either.
I am a great admirer of Ulysses S. Grant, but I am very amused by the outraged reviews posted here by other Grant fans, particularly the ones who do not seem to have bothered to actually read the book.  It seems to have eluded certain reviewers that &quot;Grant Speaks&quot; is a SATIRE.  Admittedly, it's a deeply flawed one, but treating it as some sort of serious biography is absurd.  They should save the brickbats for real assaults on Grant's reputation, like the William McFeely book.  Now, THAT'S character assassination.<br />That said, there is much in this book to dislike.  The humor is largely crudely sophomoric, virtually all the women are depicted as vulgar tramps (the ghosts of Julia Grant and Mary Lincoln are probably filing their defamation suits against Erlich as we speak,) the &quot;dual Grant&quot; concept was promising, but the author doesn't seem to have known just what to do with it, and the &quot;first Julia&quot; subplot is unnecessary, uninteresting, and, at its end, disturbingly bathetic.  It was grossly out of place and, in my view, was the most ruinous element of the book.<br />So why did I read &quot;Grant Speaks&quot; through to the end?  The answer is that, despite the book's fatal defects, every couple of pages or so I found something that forced me to laugh out loud.  The Lincoln parody was a scream.  Besides, the author deserves some credit for at least attempting a different, and potentially brilliant concept.  &quot;Grant Speaks&quot; had the possibility of being a classic satire.  I'm genuinely sorry that it is not.
Ulysses S. Grant was a complex, fascinating personality who led a dramatic, multi-faceted rollercoaster of a life.  Why hasn't anyone been able to write a decent novel about the guy?  &quot;Ulysses&quot; accomplishes a near-impossible feat:  It succeeds in making Grant look dull.  His life is presented as a series of brief, disconnected, uninvolving scenes, the personalities are as flat as my computer monitor, and Skimin's idea of plot and character development is to get Grant drunk on every other page, even at moments when not even his hostile biographers accuse him of getting plastered.  Poor Ulys deserves better.  Calling all talented dramatists--here is your next project!
This fascinating autobiography is a must-read for anyone wanting a personal view not only of Ulysses Grant, but of his all-too-often ignored and underrated wife.  Julia Grant's memoir is an unusually frank and entertaining visit with her unique, delightfully engaging personality--she was a far cry from the rather sour-looking, unprepossessing image one gets from her photographs.<br />One thing I found particularly fascinating about her book--something previous reviewers have strangely overlooked--is the inadvertent way she reveals not only Grant's many virtues, but his faults as well.  Grant's cold, affection-starved upbringing left him emotionally immature in certain ways.  Julia's candid style depicts her husband as sometimes capable of being pig-headed, uncommunicative, and remarkably insensitive to her feelings, while his usually charming sense of humor could take on a childishly cruel edge.  This warts-and-all look at the man is a refreshing change from the uncritical, unbelievable hagiography found in most contemporary accounts of Grant.  In short, this book is a psychological gold mine!
This is not a terrible book, but it is a highly irrelevant one.  Simpson has nothing new or interesting to say about his subject--he merely recycles material found in earlier, more interesting Grant books, such as the works of Lloyd Lewis, Bruce Catton, and Horace Porter, and his writing style is strangely tedious, as if he occasionally lost interest in what he himself was writing.  Simpson sometimes actually manages to make Grant's life look dull--something I had thought was a near-impossibility.  Perhaps Simpson's next volume will be more original and involving, but I'm not holding my breath.
Before reading this book, I knew nothing about Karen Blixen's personal life, other than that she supposedly died of syphilis.  The author refutes this idea, proving that Blixen's physical problems were due to the various drugs and poisons she took to combat her alleged illness.  However, Donelson somehow misses one glaringly obvious detail--it's clear, reading this book, that Blixen never had syphilis at all!  First, her husband (apparently the only man she was sleeping with at the time) never showed any signs of the disease.  Second, Blixen never tested positive for syphilis--indeed, we have no proof that any doctor ever diagnosed her as a sufferer.  All we have is her word for it, which is clearly suspect.  Blixen, from what this book says, was a fantasist--or, if you want to be blunt, a pathological liar, who clearly loved to create an \\"image\\" for herself.  Plus, she had particular reason to have a neurotic fixation about syphilis--her father committed suicide when she was a child, and it was said he did this because he found he had contracted the disease.  This was bound to leave its mark on her.<br />Granted, this was a relatively minor aspect of Blixen's strange life, but I find it odd that the author would refute one aspect to the \\"Blixen syphilis legend\\" and not take it to its logical conclusion.
I tried, gang.  Honestly, I tried my hardest to enjoy the Lymond Chronicles.  I love well-done historical fiction (which is surprisingly difficult to find,) I'm interested in anything that even slightly concerns Mary Queen of Scots, and I'm a sucker for swashbucklers.  So, why am I seemingly the only person on the planet who would rather stick a fork up my nose than try and read these books again?  I found Dunnett's work to be poorly written, with a pretentious, overly \\"poetic\\" prose style, the plots tedious, and all the characters unlikable, unbelievable, and flat.  Also, Dunnett follows a school of historical fiction that has always bugged me--where the writer uses real historical characters (such as Mary and Margaret Lennox) and real episodes in history, but twists them around so they bear no resemblance whatsoever to the truth.  I tend to believe authors should either use real figures in as historically accurate a way as possible, or use completely fictional characters and plots.  Mixing both never seems to work.  Particularly here.  I know this review won't make me too popular on this board, but I'd like all you Dunnett fans to know that I'm not putting anyone down for loving these books.  Good for you, I say.  I just wish I understood why you do.
While the idea of writing an overview of how Mary Queen of Scots has been portrayed over the centuries is a good one, Jayne Lewis is simply not up to the task.  For one thing, she seems to have only a superficial knowledge  about Mary herself, which lends a shallowness to Lewis' interpretations.  For another, her style is extremely dry and overly analytical.  At times,  she sounds so laughably like the stereotype of the &quot;Ivory tower&quot;  pompous professor, that the book begins to read like parody.<br />Worst of all  are a number of unforgivably egregious historical errors she makes, which,  again, just shows her unfamiliarity with her subject.  For instance, she  includes several unflattering quotes about Mary that Lewis attributes to  Sir James Melville's &quot;Memoirs.&quot;  These quotes actually come from  &quot;Master Randolph's Fantasy,&quot; a libellous ballad about Mary that  was circulated by her Protestant enemies in 1565.  In discussing Hugh  Campbell's 1825 book, which prints several letters (not to be confused with  the famous &quot;Casket Letters,&quot;) supposedly written by Mary to  Bothwell, Lewis says Campbell himself forged those letters.  Since Campbell  was merely reprinting letters from a pamphlet that was published in 1725  (one of the letters was originally printed in the 16th century memoirs of  Brantome,) Campbell obviously was not the one who wrote them.  Such obvious  mistakes make it hard to take anything Lewis says very seriously.  (Speaking of the &quot;Casket Letters,&quot; Lewis gives the impression  that these, too, have been proved to be forgeries--which is very far from  the truth.)<br />In short, the idea of the book was a good one, but it was  wasted in the hands of a bad writer.
Why is it that works of history aimed at children(both fiction and non-fiction) are nearly always so incredibly historically inaccurate?  &quot;The Queen's Own Fool&quot; is one of the worst of this type that I  have read. The history (especially the parts dealing with Mary's marriages  to Darnley and Bothwell) have no connection to the truth whatsoever.  Yolen's depiction of Bothwell, in particular, comes off like something from  a bad comic book.  I would have thought that even the most casual  historians would have gotten past this old stereotype of him as a scheming  villain who had to force Mary into marrying him.  (What a joke!) By all  means, children should learn history (especially the history of someone as  fascinating as Mary Queen of Scots) but this is hardly the way to do it!  If that wasn't bad enough, the book is very poorly written--it has little  value even as literature.  What else can I say?  I would have given this  book no stars at all if I could have!
I'm not usually interested in &quot;romance&quot; novels, but I am quite interested in Mary, Queen of Scots, and her third husband, the Earl of Bothwell, which is what inspired me to read this book.  And I am glad I  did.  It is well written, involving, and the hero and heoine are rather  more realistic and complex than the characters usually found in this  genre.<br />As a Mary and Bothwell &quot;fan,&quot; I liked that the book  depicted them both favorably.  Mary, of course, has had many defenders over  the centuries, but Bothwell has not been as fortunate.  I was delighted  that Holling had the insight to portray him as the tragic hero I believe he  was.<br />In short, I'd recommend the book to anyone interested in this type  of fiction.  Let's hope Holling tries her hand again.
