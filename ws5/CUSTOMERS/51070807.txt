What would be the criteria for rating this book is not what is written in it but how ready are you for it ..... It is simply a step in the explanation of all . To some it might be perceived as pure fiction, to some it would be ridiculous, to others simply the truth. The truth sometimes stares us in the face, but we still fail to realize it simply because we are too fixated on the values and ideas that had been imprinted in ou minds (or our ancesstors minds) for the last thousands of years. but we have mentally evolved we now realize that the earth is not the centre of the universe, that the our plant is one amongst trillions of planets and not the only one ..... but we still fail to even question ideas and beleifs that were passed to us over hundereds of years cause of fear ..... fear of hell fear of being rates as superstituous , or any other fear ........ All I can say is that to the investigating individual, to the open minded student of the truth this is , the least to say, a revelation and enlightment that is a corner stone for more understanding for the human race. One complaint to the writer, or dictator, of this book .... it is simply not fair to keep the remiander of this with you ... it is your duty to give the whole truth so those who are ready can benefit from it .... five years is a long time.

This is probably one of the most mysterious books that ever came out. One could read it as a novel and be completely disappointed by the plot and give it up half way through ...... but the true value of the book is in  simplifying spiritual concepts that had been long forgotten by man along  the way ........ the concepts and spiritual ideas of the book had long been  researched and practiced for thousands of years and what the writer does is  try to put those old / everlasting theories into a new and comprehendable  scenario so that the people of the new age would understand them.<br />To  enjoy this book you have to understand what it really offers and from there  you would appreciate the values that might change your life forever,  otherwise it will be just another OK novel.
