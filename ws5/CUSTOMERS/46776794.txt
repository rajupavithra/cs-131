This is a must read for all who are genuinely walking  on a spiritual path. In my opinion this is the first text I have come in contact with, that helped me making sense of religion, clarifying the origins and purpose of mankind. Unlike religious texts it does not instill the fear of punishment coming from God (or whatever you wish to call it) for our mistakes; and unlike new age texts it does not tell us that no matter what we do it will be alright...we are the makers of our own destiny, and by default, affecting the lives of the people around us. Based on the accounts and recollections, it clearly expresses how and why the responsibility and effects of our actions are truly only our own.  I feel enriched by its content and information, and it truly made me think about myself and the world around me. Although It is dwelling on the fine line between imagination and truth (and my belief system states they are one and the same...) I think that who chooses to take this information as 100% imaginative should still be able to grasp the value of the lessons it carries: such as our responsibility as individuals to our planet and community.  I am thankful that Shirley MacLaine has the courage and the strength to share such a deeply intimate experience with the rest of us, teaching by example that our own inner questions, doubts and fears can be addressed and answered: we all have these questions, however most of us are too afraid to face them, in fear of having to change and reconsider everything we thought we knew by realizing we do not.
