MORE BIRDING BY EAR is the follow-up to BIRDING BY EAR.  BIRDING BY EAR presented 85 species of birds.  MORE BIRDING BY EAR presents 96 additional species.  MORE BIRDING BY EAR follows the same format as BIRDING BY EAR.  Species are grouped according to similar types of vocalizations.  Primary songs and calls are presented.  In some cases, other songs and calls are also presented.  Vocalizations are analyzed, and comparisons are made to other, similar sounding birds.  Phonetics and tips are suggested to help the listener to remember the vocalizations.  It is suggested that you complete BIRDING BY EAR before going on to MORE BIRDING BY EAR. <br /> <br />Species included in More Birding by Ear are: <br /> <br />DISK 1:  Sora, Virginia Rail, Clapper Rail, King Rail, Yellow Rail, Black Rail, Pied-billed Grebe, Least Bittern, Common Moorhen, American Coot, Wood Duck, Great Blue Heron, Marsh Wren, Least Flycatcher, Acadian Flycatcher, Willow Flycatcher, Alder Flycatcher, Indigo Bunting, Blue Grosbeak, Pine Siskin, Ruby-crowned Kinglet, Winter Wren, Red-breasted Nuthatch, Common Nighthawk, Blue-gray Gnatcatcher, Evening Grosbeak, Osprey, Northern Saw-whet Owl, Black-billed Cuckoo, Yellow-billed Cuckoo, Brown Creeper, Golden-crowned Kinglet, Fish Crow, Common Raven, Swainson's Thrush, Bicknell's Thrush, Boat-tailed Grackle, Rusty Blackbird, American Pipit, Horned Lark. <br /> <br />DISK 2:  Prairie Warbler, Blue-winged Warbler, Golden-winged Warbler, Black-throated Blue Warbler, Cerulean Warbler, Prothonotary Warbler, Palm Warbler, Worm-eating Warbler, Cape May Warbler, Bay-breasted Warbler, Blackpoll Warbler, Nashville Warbler, Wilson's Warbler, Chestnut-sided Warbler, Magnolia Warbler, Blackburnian Warbler, Mourning Warbler, Yellow-rumped Warbler, Northern Waterthrush, Louisiana Waterthrush, Swainson's Warbler, Yellow-throated Warbler, Tennessee Warbler, Canada Warbler, Yellow-breasted Chat, Savannah Sparrow, Vesper Sparrow, Bachman's Sparrow, Henslow's Sparrow, Grasshopper Sparrow, Saltmarsh Sharp-tailed Sparrow, Seaside Sparrow, Common Loon, Yellow-bellied Sapsucker, Olive-sided Flycatcher, Blue-headed Vireo. <br /> <br />DISK 3:  Lesser Yellowlegs, Greater Yellowlegs, Short-billed Dowitcher, Long-billed Dowitcher, Black-Bellied Plover, American Golden-Plover, Semipalmated Plover, Spotted Sandpiper, Whimbrel, Upland Sandpiper, Willet, Least Sandpiper, Semipalmated Sandpiper, Sanderling, Pectoral Sandpiper, Common Snipe, Royal Tern, Caspian Tern, Common Tern, Forster's Tern, Least Tern. <br /> <br />At the end of DISK 3 is a \\"test.\\"  All 96 species are grouped by habitat.  The songs and calls are presented, but in a different order from the learning groups.  The listener is not told which bird he is listening to.  This can be frustrating at first, but is also a good way to learn.  I found that the first few times through, I missed practically all of them.  But bit-by-bit, I began to identify some of the calls.  As I mastered more of the calls, it became easier and easier for me to identify the remaining ones. <br />
I've read a lot of books about the Pacific war, but this one is definitely my favorite.<br />Rex Alan Smith served 36 months as an Army Engineer in the Pacific.  Since then, he has traveled extensively, visiting and talking with other veterans of the Pacific war.  Gerald Meehl has spent years combing the Pacific and photographing the places which played important roles in WWII in the Pacific: places such as Pearl Harbor, Wake Island, Bataan, Corregidor, Guadalcanal, Tulagi, Munda, Tarawa, Guam, Saipan, Tinian, Peleliu, Iwo Jima, Okinawa; along with lesser-known, but exotic outposts, such as Bora Bora and Pago Pago.<BR> <BR>What emerges from their work is a series of more than 20 essays on individual battles, in the order in which they occurred, from the attack on Pearl Harbor to the final surrender at Tokyo Bay. The essays begin with explanations of why the battles were fought, and what strategies were employed. Aerial photographs give you an overall view of the operation. First-hand accounts by the men who fought there give you a chilling sense of what it was like to charge up the beach in the face of withering enemy fire. There are hundreds of photographs - about half in black and white, which were taken during the actual fighting; and half in color, taken by Mr. Meehl some years later, often of the same scenes. The color photographs are beautiful and haunting. You'll see the rusting hulk of an abandoned tank, or the crumbling rubble of a bombed-out pillbox, surrounded by sparkling white beaches with swaying palms, crystal clear ocean waters, and blue skies with fluffy white clouds.<br />In his introduction to the book, Joe Foss, Medal of Honor winner at Guadalcanal, says, \\"We could not cover every campaign in detail, nor was it our purpose to present a comprehensive history of the Pacific war.  Rather, we tried to create for the reader, while the veterans themselves can recall it, what that war was like--how it looked and felt and smelled--and to examine the legacy today of a war so fiercely fought on faraway Pacific Islands.\\"
I picked up these books hoping to gain some insight into the actions of the Marine Corps in the Pacific during World War II.  What I found instead was a sort of soap opera that rambles on for hundreds of pages without getting around to much actual fighting.  For example, The Marines don't even get to Guadalcanal (their first major offensive) until the end of book III, some 1200 pages into the story.  Those 1200 intervening pages are mostly conversations (ad nauseam) between stateside Marine Corps officers as they sit around headquarters, or go out on the town chasing skirts.<BR>  <BR>The small portion of the books that is devoted to actual battles is done in such a cursory fashion that you're left with the impression that the author either finds this aspect of the Marines' mission distasteful, or doesn't understand it well enough to write about it.  Mr. Griffin could have deleted about 80% of his material, and would have ended up with better books, albeit still not good ones.<br />If you're the sort of person who likes to watch daytime soap operas, then you may enjoy these books.  If, on the other hand, you're interested in military history, the banality of these books will leave you screaming in frustration.

I like Shakespeare, but find his language hard to decipher at times.  Standard texts have footnotes to help you to understand how he uses certain words, but after looking up a few dozen of these, I find myself starting to lose the thread of the story line.  The \\"Shakespeare Made Easy\\" approach has been a godsend for me.  Now, whenever I run into a difficult passage, I can glance over to the other side of the book and read the same passage in plain English.  A light bulb blinks on, and I say, \\"Aha!  That's what this means!\\"  Unfamiliar words are instantly translated for me as I see them in the context of a passage which I now understand fully.  I've read Julius Caesar three or four times previously, but never so fluidly and with such enjoyment and understanding as I just did with the help of the \\"Shakespeare Made Easy\\" book.
I love this book.  It's all here, all the people, places, and events which make up the Bible.  Virtually every page has beautiful photographs, paintings, colorful maps, timelines or charts, which accompanies the text and helps you to understand and remember it.  Historical background notes and opinions by Bible scholars are also included.      You could read this book just by itself and come away with a pretty good basic knowledge of the whole Bible.  I like to use it to support my regular Bible reading and study.  It's helped me to see \\"the big picture\\", and given me simplified explanations of difficult passages, which has been extremely helpful.       The material is pretty concentrated, so I've found it's best to slow down and take your time going through it.
Learn in Your Car Spanish is an entertaining way to pick up a lot of vocabulary in a short period of time.  The sound quality is excellent.  I encountered none of the audio problems referred to A. Prechtl.
