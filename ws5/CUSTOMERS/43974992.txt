This was good enough to read during one prolonged session in the bathtub.  Oops!  That says more about me than it does about the book.  I have been enchanted with all the \\"Cat Who...\\"  books that I've read, as they are reliably wholesome and fun.  I don't know why I passed Lilian Jackson Braun's books by for so long, but I am trying to make up for lost time by savoring another one each week.  Braun's clever protagonist, James Qwilleran, embodies the fantasy of inheriting billions, yet staying grounded enough to continue a newspaper career and enjoy small town life.  Although Qwill doesn't travel far, his escapades read like a gastronomic travelogue.   \\"The Cat Who Smelled a Rat\\" isn't a great classical work, but I have to give it the highest rating because it meets my 5-star criteria of \\"I wish I'd written that\\".

\\"Mrs. Chippy's Last Expedition\\" is a playful window into the history and personalities of the 1908-09 Endurance expedition to Antarctica. Incredibly, the ship was crushed after 9 months trapped in the ice, but not a single man was lost.  Mrs. Chippy (the cat who accompanied the crew of the Endurance to Antarctica) leads us on an examination, not just of history and brave explorers, but of day-to-day survival and interaction between men in dire circumstances.  If you love cats and have a curiosity about Antarctic exploration, this is a great book to start your journey.  One must, however, have patience with the 100-plus footnotes, as they are a slightly awkward part of the story that enable one to understand the big picture behind the journal of this extraordinary feline.<br />\\"Mrs. Chippy's Last Expedition\\", though it is light and high-spirited, tells a vivid tale which stands in the same compelling league as Jon Krakauer's, \\"Into the Wild\\".  Both left me in awe of nature and wringing my handkerchief by books' end.
What starts out as a voyeuristic glimpse at an addictive personality that makes the reader feel so superior and in control, actually turns into a disaster-ridden route to maturity with actual character development.  <br />One caution-if you don't know that silk cuts are cigarettes or what snogging is, you'd be wise to be armed with a British English-American English dictionary. Otherwise you'll stumble around in amusement looking for clues to the meaning of quirky British-isms like I did.  <br />\\"The Edge\\" is fun escapist reading.
\\"French Lessons\\" is not Mayle's best book, but it is not one to be passed up, either.  I recommend \\"A Year in Provence\\" and \\"Tojour Provence\\" for a better flavor of Mayle's love affair with France.  For the art and fiction aficionado, \\"Chasing Cezanne\\" is quite a hoot.  Peter Mayle has turned me into a Francophile with his wonderful books about everyday life in Provence.  Mayle describes the French as wonderfully expressive people who are eager to share their knowledge and passion about food and everything else that may come up in conversation.  I have a feeling that Mr. Mayle could find that positive reaction in people where ever he went in the world because his approach is curious, friendly, and whet with a tremendous appetite for life (as well as for alcohol, cheese, bread, etc.)  Mr. Mayle gives me motivation to conquer my reclusive habits in order to better enjoy my stay in Provence some day on my way to Giverny.
I read Dr. Atkins' New Diet Revolution on the recommendation of a a registered nurse friend who had gotten great results from her high protein diet.  As someone who has dieted since age 13, I am always interested in something new-but I rarely actually try out what I consider to be a \\"fad\\" diet.  I read the book and wanted to believe the information presented.  Atkins' material does read easily, including innumerable case examples that encourage the reader to identify with his patients and feel hopeful about their own results. However, I found Dr. Atkins to be very defensive. He seemingly enjoys the controversy his diet invariably stirs up and talks about the \\"academic medical authorities\\" and \\"consensus medicine\\" as if they were gang bangers trying to give medical advice.  I think Atkins' \\"science\\" is skewed because other researchers cannot duplicate his research and results (that is a main tenant of  real science).  <br />Despite my initial trepidation, I ate the prescribed 20 grams of carbohydrate (per day) and the rest fat and protein for 48 hours.  It is the strangest thing I have ever done to my body with the exception of pregnancy.  I felt weird, peed constantly, was voraciously thirsty, but I didn't feel hungry.  I would compare my lack of hunger to the way one's appetite wanes during a serious bout of the flu.  I lost 3 pounds, but could not continue the diet because I felt too spacey.  I believe that staying on the diet would harm me. <br />This diet scares me-I'm sticking to my grandmother's wise dictum of variety and moderation.  I may not ever achieve rail thinness, but I hope to have my grandmother's 97 years of meaningful life, love, independence and persistent health.
