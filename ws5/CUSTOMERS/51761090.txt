I must admit I became a Larry McMurtry fan when I read Lonesome Dove, my  first McMurtry novel.  Since then I have been disppointed in most of his  books I have read.  The Desert Rose was a huge disappointment.  Had I read  Desert Rose first I probably would never have read another of his books.   It was trashy from beginning to end.  Was it really necessary to use the f  word so often?  Perhaps the book is a true picture of the Las Vegas  showgirl scene.  There many, many, many better books to read. Your time  could be better spent.
NOT ONE OF MCMURTY'S BETTER EFFORTS.  A THINLY DISGUISED ACCOUNT OF WILLIAM BONNEY (BILLY THE KID). CHARACTERS NOT CREDITABLE OR BELIEVABLE. BEN SIPPY'S FRIENDSHIP WITH BILLY, A COLD-BLOODED KILLER.  A SEVEN FOOT  BLACK MAN RIDING A CAMEL AND KILLING WITH A SWORD. I DON'T THINK SO!
I fail to see why this book is such a literary rave.  It's the story about spoiled rich people with no meaning to their lives.  If this is the best of the author's works, I won't read any more of his books.  There are too many  truly good books in the library.
