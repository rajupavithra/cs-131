Gender dysphoria is the medical profession's term for the belief that one's gender does not align with one's biological sex.<br /><br />Those who cross the divide (from male to female or female to male) are called transsexuals or transgendered by many, but, sadly, are called freaks by some.<br /><br /> Estimated at affecting 1 of 30,000 individuals, gender dysphoria is certainly not common, but neither is it unknown. Currently transsexuals are the staple of tv talk shows and Leno jokes, but these people  are simply attempting to life within society on society's terms.<br /><br /> Dr Randi Ettner is a psychologist who has devoted her life to counseling those with gender dysphoria,  helping them to adjust to society's rigid rules when possible and,  when not possible, helping them to cross the rigid barrier we call gender.  She has written a sensitive, caring book about her experiences, humorous at times, heart breaking at others.<br /><br /> Ettner's book is a wonderful antidote to the cruelty of talk tv, but, more importantly,  will provide an important window on this condition that, unless addressed can easily result in  mutilation, victimization or suicide.<br /><br /> Kristin Hayward  [...]
<br />I suppose it is inevitable that, as the post-war boomers approach the big six-zero over the next decade,  we will see a tidal flood of tender, soul-searching narratives.  Boomers want to understand rather than simply experience life,  and most have been frustrated by life's refusal to obey our expectations.   <br /> John Barth seems to have made such soul searching his life work,  and I seem to have followed him book for book, life experience by life experience over the years.  A clever &quot;academic&quot; writer (read: &quot;he writes like a dream but his wit sometimes overwhelms the story&quot;),  Barth has addressed boomer experience and frailty .    <br />Seeming to be five to ten years ahead of boomers,  his books have ranged from the tragedy resulting from a terribly botched abortion (long before we openly spoke of this horror),  through the visionary and usually misguided quest of the idealist (Sot-Weed Factor and Giles Goatboy),  the terrible pain of realizing one is an adult (the clever but exhausting Letters),  to more leisurely and accessible mid-life reassessment as protagonists take &quot;voyages&quot; on the emotional seascape of middle age (Sabbatical,  Tidewater Tales,  Last Voyage of Somebody the Sailor,  Once upon a Time...).    <br />  Each five years or so,  I eagerly await his newest offering,  devour it,  and then feel frustrated when his literary games seem to detract from his story.  <br />But,  then,  each time I realize (as if for the first time),  the essential nature of his writing.  Like the age-old games from which his writings spring (the quest/redemption stories of the Iliad and Oddessy,  the &quot;doomed&quot; prophet stories of the Old and New Testaments,  the mistaken identity games of Shakespeare and thousands of authors since,  and the metaphor of story as voyage and voyage as growth from Chaucer,  1001 Nights, etc),  Barth plays his games to remind us that the act of story telling *is* the experience,  it *is* the reasonwe read: the experience of hearing ghost stories around the camp fire remains with us long long after we have forgotten the actual story.  <br />And then I remember that, as a reader,  I have no more &quot;right&quot; to expect neatness and closure in a Barth story than I have the right to expect neatness and closure in my own life.  Try as we might,  our own work,  our own story is always in progress.  And like Barth's beloved Tidewater,  the ebb and flow of our own story defies our attempt to capture to master it.  <br />In the end,  life and Barth's stories remain as delightfully cleansing as the tide itself. <br />KRH  [...]

<br />Barbara Tuchman's work is in the genre of the essayists of the 19th century. Like them, she is erudite, humorous, and  at times, disorganized. <br />But how could it be otherwise? Imagine writing such a work about the 20th century, attempting to describe for  someone 600 years hence how we have   lived over these last hundred years, and how we have changed.<br />   This is a work which some may wish to plow though in several days; others will   put it by their best arm chair and read a section at a time. <br />   Given the horror of Bosnia, the tedium of politics, and the    daily drudge (which at times seems in spirit to be remarkably similar to that which Tuchman describes) such a work of Tuckman's can lift us up and help us to see beyond our own calamitous   century -- plus ca change; plus la meme chose.   <br />   KRH<BR>   [...]
<br />Unlike the &quot;reader&quot; below, I have read Miles' book. I wish to briefly compare it to another best-seller, Karen Armstrong's History of God.  Her's is the better work, but her's is a very different book. Armstrong carefully works through 3,000  years of Jewish, Christian and Muslim belief in God, explaining how each religion sought to answer similar questions, work through similar experiences (God as remote, God as Personal, etc).   <br />   Miles' approach is very different. He takes the Jewish Old Testament (ordered, as it is,  differently than the Christian Old Testament),   and carefully,  methodically recounts and analyses God's many appearances.  Where Armstrong is grounded in years of scholarship, Miles' utilizes literary analysis to investigate the difference between each appearance,     the different way in which God reacts to Man and Mankind to God.    <br />   Miles does not except each reader to agree with him,  but the reader who does read Miles' book will find his own beliefs challenged, refreshed, and   yes, maybe even strengthened.   <br />   KRH<BR>   [...]
