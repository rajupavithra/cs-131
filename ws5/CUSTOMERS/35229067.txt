Richard Preston gives us a good idea, good discrition, gory deaths, decent characters... what's more to ask for in a book.  Well except that the book just went on for forever with repetitive things and when you expected something really exciting to happen it is just doesn't happen.  I'm not saying that the book wasn't good in the way it was trying to be.  I am just saying that causal readers who pick it up might not like it because there is no real payoff in the book.  <br />The book does offer good things though.  As there are some shocking moments and the thought of a virus being able to kill most of the human population give us a large sense of horror. The gory detail of the deaths and of the virus characteristics makes things even more horrifying.  The fact that the ebola virus has no scent and can be transfered by air and blood is scary enough alone.  <br />My last comments is that this book would be five stars for someone who is looking for a non-fiction wonder.  But those readers who are looking for an exciting book with a good payoff in the end isn't going to be head over heels for the book. <br />Overall I did like the book but expected more.
