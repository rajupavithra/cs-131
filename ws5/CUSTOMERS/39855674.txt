This is a very good book in that it explains everything in step by step manner. In the very beginning, the author mentions the background you need to have to be able to use this book and author means it. <br />The reason this book lost a star is the explanation of the concepts in initial chapters. If you have absolutely no background in EJB, JNDI and RMI, you might have hard time understanding the concepts. <br />The best feature of this book is that it explains (1) the concept, (2) how to write code and (3) how to deploy the code and test it. There are very few books that does all three (most of the time other books will say deployment depends on your application server). Another good feature is that this book uses J2EE RI. Many books use servers like websphere or weblogic, which requirs hi-fi hardware and of course availability of server.<br />If you know what EJB is and ready to start writing code, go ahead and buy the book. Be sure to keep another reference (a good online article or Ed Roman's free EJB book) to read initial concepts and be sure to download code for this book (as this books saves space by NOT providing full code)
