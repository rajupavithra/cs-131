I've long been a fan of the other Covenant books and of Donaldson's other series. (though Gap into Darkness was odd)  After the prior series, I never expected Donaldson to write more in the Covenant universe, but I'm certainly glad he did.<br /><br />This book did seem to ramp up slowly/gradually in sense of action and in the feeling that you (and the characters) are gaining understanding of what is going on.  That is obviously frustrating to other reviewers, but IMO it's part of the natural build-up in a complex and worthy multi-book series.  It's a book with multiple protagonists and multiple antagonists, some unknown so far, as are their effects, powers and motivations.  That takes more time to build than a simple good-guys-here, bad-guys-there book.<br /><br />So, without going into all the over-analysis of some of the the other reviewers, I'll just say this: read the other Covenant books first, then get this one.  It'll take a little patience, but it'll be worth it.  ... and I really hope the next part of the series comes soon...
IMO this wasn't as good as any of the earlier books in the series.  While David Brin always seems to jump from one character to another, sometimes following a dozen different characters, this one tended to bounce around so much that it was harder to follow and harder to see the coherent direction it was going.<br /><br />The Streaker crew get beaten on by so many different races continuously during this and pull so many 'magic' tricks and escapes that it's a relief to reach the end.  (great ending IMO)<br /><br />That said, if you've enjoyed the earlier books, you probably have to read this anyway or you'll be left hanging.<br /><br />I's still recommend it, just not one of my favorites from Brin.
There was an interesting interview with the authors on NPR on the Diane Rehm show 7/21/2005<br /><br />[...]

This book got a very favorable review in the Baltimore Sunpaper article \\"'Smashed' should serve as a wakeup call for parents\\"  on 3/1/2005 by Susan Reimer.<br /><br />It certainly resonates with what I felt and saw in my friends in college.  I plan to read it to help me prepare my own children for that part of their lives.

From some of the early reviews mentioning that this diverted from most of the characters in  &quot;The Curse of Chalion&quot; I was prepared to be a little disappointed since I enjoyed &quot;The Curse of Chalion&quot; so much... however, this has the same quality of writing, characters and plot twists as the other.<br />One thing I enjoy about her writing is that they're never predictable.  You can't guess where the plot will be going next. (though it works - she doesn't go off in the weeds just to be unpredictable)<br />I really enjoyed it and I'd highly recommend it to others who enjoy Bujold books.

The author was interviewed on NPR on All Things Considered on 11/18/2003.  The interview is on the NPR site.  The book sounded very interesting, with beautiful photos.<br />[...]<br />They say &quot;Ecologist Thomas Eisner has a passion to learn everything he can about insects -- and he says their ability to solve problems could teach people plenty. The pioneer of the field of chemical ecology has a new book out, For Love of Insects. We talk with Eisner about his life's work.&quot;
Agent of Change was the first book by Steve Miller and Sharon Lee that I ever came across.  I re-read my copy of that and Conflict of Honors for years before I finally found them on the web and learned they had more books.  I've read all their books and stories and love them all.  I can't recommend them highly enough.
I got this from the library and was very disappointed.  Not only was the story line very choppy, jumping from place to place without any real development of details (or characters or plot), but it completely glossed over things like her reaction to a wildly new culture, language, technology, etc.  All the physics \\"detail\\" tossed in looked like it was made up by someone who didn't have a clue what they were talking about.  (perhaps the author does have a clue, but that's how it came across to me)<br />Also, aside from whether you liked the frequent sex scene detail in the book or not, they also mentioned, but then avoided the fact that this was sex between an adult man and a minor.  When they first had sex, and when they got married it was brought up, and even the people in the future were shocked and disapproving. But then they all just jumped on past the issue.<br />Overall, this book was poor enough to put me off trying anything else by this author.  Even in high school this would have been embarrassing to admit having wasted time on.
I've read everything I could get my hands on by Steve Miller and Sharon Lee ever since I got my first copy of Agent of Change.  It was great to read something with all new characters by them.<br />In all their books, they have better characters and development of details and story line than any other authors I've read.  I also find myself either laughing out loud or crying as I read more than any other author, with the possible exception of Lois McMaster Bujold.  <br />Highly recommended, and I can't wait for them to write more.
Just read this from the library, now I have to get my own copy, since I'll be re-reading it from time to time.  I've read every L.M. Bujold book I could get my hands on and have loved the miles series, but this was a nice change.  It was still up to the excellent standard of story-telling of everything else she's written though.  I find myself either laughing out loud or with tears in my eyes (or both at the same time) more often with her stories than any other author.  I can't recommend them highly enough.  Get this book!
Unlike many series that degrade as they go, this one only gets more focused, more interesting and more exciting.  If you read this book, I'd recommend you read the rest of the series first, or at least the couple most recent.  It's definitely worth it though.
I've had these 3 stories in the original paperbacks for years and they are pretty worn from rereading them so many times.  I've also bought every other Liaden Universe story from them that I could... and anxiously waited for more ;-)<br />These stories and novels are some of the best I've ever read, and I read a *lot*... ;-)  The characters are so well drawn that you feel they're family by the end.  The plots and pace keep you immersed until that final page... I can't recommend them highly enough. I don't have the words.
I've considered the Liaden universe series one of my lifetime favorites for years now.  The two stories in Pilot's Choice are definitely two of the best and most enjoyable.  As another reviewer mentioned, there is real joy in the characters and in watching them find their way together, though it hurts to see the obstacles and miscommunications that make those journeys painful. That's just part of a story where you are really immersed and connected with the characters.
