After graduating from West Point in 1969, he chose the Infantry and volunteered for Vietnam. This book tells of his experience as a lieutenant in a combat zone, a fortified camp that protected a Vietnamese village. It is about the experience of one platoon leader in combat.<br />The camp was surrounded by booby traps and an enemy hidden in daytime. They were able to repel assaults, but took their share of losses. The landing zone for helicopters was outside the perimeter; it was their sole link to headquarters, and their supply line.<br />Their stay there came to an end when their enemy shelled the neighboring village, causing many casualties. The villagers began moving away, negating the need for their camp. They were moved away to a new area. I think the enemy got a new leader, one who read B.H. Liddell Hart's book &quot;Strategy&quot; and used the &quot;indirect approach&quot; to eliminate the camp.
