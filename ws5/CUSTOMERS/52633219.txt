The premise of this book is ridiculous.  How can hydrogen be the answer to all our energy problems when hydrogen is not a source of energy - it is a form of stored energy because no free state hydrogen exists on earth.  It takes more energy to get hydrogen out of water or petroleum products than can be gained from hydrogen produced.  There is no technology I am aware of that can change this.  He talks about using renewable forms of energy to produce hydrogen,  but if that were possible why not just use it to generate  electricity for the existing power grid?  This reminds me of the investment book that starts out by saying &quot;First you start with a million dollars...&quot;.  This is not much different than saying &quot;Just use hydrogen&quot;.  The problem is getting that first million dollars and in the same way the problem is finding a source of economical hydrogen which doesn't take more power to produce than it returns when burned or used in a fuel cell.  He offers no viable solutions for this.  The easy part is building the fuel cell.
