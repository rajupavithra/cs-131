I was just thinking about this book today.  I read it about 5 years ago and it really did make a huge change in my life.  Starting in middle school I became obsessed with dieting and compulsive eating even though I was not fat.  I tortured myself by obsessing over my weight, and how many caleries I ate for years to the point that I forgot how to have fun.  This book woke me up, and it made me realize that my favorite color IS red (you'll have to read it).  Anyway, no matter your size, if you are constantly concerned with food, dieting, weight and so on, READ THIS.  I can't even remember all of what is said, but that I was a different person after I read it.
I don't like giving a synopsis or summary of the book. Thats what reading it is for. What I do like to discuss in reviews is what kind of effect the book had on me. The mood and atmosphere of the book was on the depressing side, but that's okay. Because life is like that sometimes. Like Kyoko Mori, if you don't confront a problem correctly, it will fester in your soul until you come to terms with it. The book was realistic. I like putting down a book and knowing it isn't &quot;too good to be true&quot; because it is true, and I don't end up in a fantasy land. <br />The book does deal with alot Kyoko's negative experiences and views of the Japanese culture. I love Japanese culture, and I think her views are totally valid. I can accept the good and bad. Why be closed minded? Kyoko even comes to appreciate and understand some of the seemingly &quot;rude&quot; behaviors of her Japanese friends, and can enlighten us outsiders to what might seem to be odd behavior. <br />Good book. It was nice for Kyoko to let go of some of her personal demons and share this very personal and painful story. Maybe we can all be as brave as her and launch head on into what we've been dreading and fearing.

I forced myself to stay off of the internet this summer (except for now, hee hee) in order to allow myself to read more novels.  After finishing two other books, I decided to pick up a random book at the library and read it.  I closed my eyes, and my finger lead me to a sweet little book. However, it looked too much like the one I just read so I looked one shelf above it.  I spotted a seemingly delicate book, grabed it, and headed for the checkout line as the library announcement kindly warned me to get the heck out of there because they were closing.<br />I'm so happy I chose this book!  I would recomend this book to those of you who want something soft, elegant, and dream-like.  Want to learn about another time and culture?  This is your book.  Feeling lonely and need some inspiring friends? This is your book.  Feeling rejected from your family because you've just been thrown into a silk-making company and don't know where to turn?  This is most definatly your book.<br />I think this is my favorite book out of the last three I've read.  I was really transported to the world of the story, and can't help to find the characters lingering in my mind days and weeks after I finished reading it.
