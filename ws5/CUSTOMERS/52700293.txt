This GRE book has basically all of the same techniques as much larger books from Kaplan and Princeton, but doesn't waste your time with lengthy discourse.  It's right to the point, which is exactly the way you want it.<br />I didn't use this book as a last-minute cram, I read it before starting my study program and it saved me countless hours of trying to figure out strategies for the question types.  This method was extremely effective and highly recommended.  Finishing the book in an afternoon or two is not difficult.<br />Final note: You will definitely need a large word list to study and some practice tests.  The free GRE powerprep tests are similar to actual GRE questions and are scaled correctly, unlike the Kaplan tests in both respects.  I used the GRE Verbal Workout for it's word lists and was not especially satisfied.  The book &quot;1000 Most Important Words,&quot; while not designed for the GRE, would have been much more thorough and effective, not to mention a third of the price.<br />Good luck!

This was the required textbook for my undergrad patho class.  I agree with previous reviewers in regard to the lack of detail and organization.  It is a book written mostly by RNs for nursing students and is not very well suited for anyone else.<br />There really is no reason anyone should buy this book.  Clearly the Robbins book is the leader in the field of clinical pathophys.  Medical and other students with more than a passing interest should head immediately toward that text.  If Robbins is to expensive/intimidating, there must be a more concise and better organized book than this one.<br />Also, this book is just too damn big.  It's unnecessary.
This book explains the theory of differential and some integral calculus.  There are worked problems, but I mostly ignored them in favor of the raw concept discussion.  <br />I read the book in the summer before my university Calc I class, and it seemed to make everything fit together much more quickly for me than most other students in the class.  The book may not be as valuable as others for review, however.<br />Highly recommended reading before you start a calculus adventure.  One of the clearest explanations of calculus theory that I've ever seen.  A few hours a week with this book in the summer will save you months of frustration during a hectic semester.
&quot;They made me write it,&quot; or so Tom Clancy would seem to imply.   Perhaps he is disinterested with his past style, or maybe this book  fulfills a contract.  Rainbow Six is analogous to Beethoven played on a  Casio toy keyboard -- the talent is hidden somewhere, but the result is too  mechanical to be enjoyed.  Those who have read his other (very good)  stories must, of course, read this superfluously opinionated sermon/novel.   A word of caution: be prepared to bulldoze your way through every tedious,  exhausting minute of seemingly never-ending verbiage.  As a die-hard fan  waiting with sweaty palms, this book was most disappointing and  irritating.<br />Rainbow Six belongs at the grocery store next to the  &quot;Bran Flakes,&quot; with a stark white cover displaying in large,  black letters only the word &quot;CLANCY.&quot;
