Before long Tate is found by a family out for a hike. Tate is badly hurt, but alive. When he awakens in a trauma unit he is befriended by Marnie Grant a physiotherapist. Tate's memory is gone, his recovery is slow. Marnie takes him home, he has no where else to go. In Philadelphia Faye and Calvin continue to search for the money they are sure Tate has hidden away while Elsie Riven and Police officer Pete Gruber ponder what has become of both Sam and Tate. The pair seemed unlikely friends. Tate owns clubs populated with girls having shaky pasts while Sam is a law officer. What Tate has done with the money his clubs and activities of his `girls' bring in surprise everyone and are sure to surprise the reader as well. At last Marnie, Tate and Tate's son Tanner begin to see a little light at the end of a very long and dark tunnel.<br />Talented author Fox presents a commanding, suspense filled read in her work Beyond Innocence. Via the inceptive story line found on the pages of Beyond Innocence we are offered a momentary view into a environment most of us can only suppose. Writer Fox has set down an intensely real assemblage of particulars fixed against an environment filled with absorbing characters and compelling, plausible dialogue, as well as an opulent piquancy for time and setting. The main plot is augmented with sub plot, transitions are handled with skill. Beyond Innocence is an impressive read certain to hook the reader from the opening lines and hold them fast right down to the last paragraph as the reader is carried along on a rollicking artifice filled ride. Conflict presented by this clever writer moves the tale along sustaining the book from beginning to end as the reader tries to sort out all the deception, complicity and trickery. Motivation for behavior of the various characters is both reasonable and logical, the reader will find himself cheering Marnie, loathing Calvin and Faye with equal venom, and hoping the best for Tate. Climax of the tale is acceptable; the conclusion presented by writer Fox is a natural outcome following the circumstances presented.<br />Main characters come alive as we read. Tate Barton is a real crumb bum, or is he? Marnie the dutiful Pastor's kid kicks loose from the guilt ridden angst her widowed mother continues to heap upon her in a creditable, satisfying manner. Faye and Calvin deserve one another. Watch for red herrings. The reader may be surprised to learn all the facts presented during the final pages. Filled with twists and turns, plots and machination Beyond Innocence is a narrative sure to intrigue the most discerning reader. <br />Enjoyed the read, happy to recommend.<br />Reviewed by: molly martin
The book opens with Jim Wilson who suffers from post traumatic stress because of a grizzly attack five years earlier dreaming of another bear attack upon himself. Experienced horseman and guide, Jim sets out on a Montana elk hunting trip with friends Joe Darton, Bark Harrison and Parson McNelty. Jim hopes to overcome his worry about another bear attacking him. About the time the men set out on their trip with four riding horses and 2 pack animals three desperate convicts break out of prison. Labaine, Morgan and Bellerman are as amoral as they come. After kidnapping a mother and daughter the trio set out to get themselves to Canada and supposed safety. As time progresses the paths of the hunting group cross with those of the criminals and their captives.<br />An unanticipated, barbarous attack carried out by the convicts leaves Jim Wilson believing he alone has survived the vicious, uncalled for shooting of Darton, Harrison and McNelty. The criminals show no regard for the plight, danger or hardship they demand of their victims as they force the two women to walk just ahead of Jim, Griz, Wilson. The determined group again sets out on horseback for their northbound trek. Misadventure, snow, lack of knowledge of the outdoors and even a bear attack or two meets the group at nearly every turn. How, or if, Jim will be able to rescue the two women and get himself safely away from these miscreants who appear determined that nothing or no one will stop them from getting out of the country becomes Wilson's predominant notion.<br />Writer Waldrip's unquestionable storytelling genius is showcased in the paragraphs of Griz Nightmare. Waldrip adds to his growing list of thrillers with the addition of this exciting tale filled with a fine cast of nicely developed characters, hard hitting dialogue and Waldrip's facility for painting word pictures delineating scenes and scenery. Griz Nightmare is a well crafted tale in which a complex plot twists and turns carrying the reader rightto the heart of the hunt with a detailed suspense filled plot. The reader feels anger, revulsion and a sense of revenge for the criminals as we witness their abuse of the kidnap victims, and their disregard for anything other than their own wants, needs and desires. The lack of compassion shown by the criminals is offset by the caring shown mother to daughter to mother, along with Jim Wilson's grim determination that he will avenge his friends deaths and somehow get himself and the two women to freedom.<br />I liked the addition of both the hand drawn map and actual photos of a hunting camp. They add much to the work. <br />Good book for a lazy afternoon, I don't recommend after dark, during a storm or when little things go bump in the night.<br />Reviewed by: molly martin
The wealthy family we met in Fire Lilies is reintroduced a generation later in Writer Massey's \\"The Caballeros of Ruby, Texas\\" as we follow Alicia Martinez' son Miguel. Don Miguel is a successful businessman, the father of six children and not too faithful husband of wife Beatriz. When Don Miguel's contracting business fails he is forced into bankruptcy. The move to California's Salinas Valley is first viewed as a fresh start. However many of the problems besetting the family follow them. Don Miguel's marriage collapses, his children marry, the life he faces in California does not resemble anything he had hoped for.<br />Writer Massey presents her narrative from the viewpoint of three of the daughters: Isabel's story runs from 1948-1953, Terre's 1942-1955, and Marta's 1956-1959. Each of the daughters views life from the perspective of her own personality and sibling position. Isabel believes the trials the family face are a result of her father's bankruptcy. When the money available for her to finish her college education is gone Isabel is not too unhappy. She didn't much care for school and goes to work before she falls in love with the man she marries. Isabel is determined that her marriage will not follow the patriarchal constraints followed by her parents. Isabel's portion of the story ends in 1953 when she as a young married mother of a three year old leaves Ruby with her husband as he completes his military duty in Kansas. Terre's tale begins in 1942 when her sister Marta is born, it is the year Don Miguel took `that woman' with him on a business trip to Mississippi. Terre is unable to reconcile her father's infidelity with his love for his family. When her own fianc√©e proves untrue she makes up her mind that she is not going to live as her mother did. At first neither parent can believe that Terre is adamant when she breaks her engagement on days before the wedding. Marta's segment is told from the standpoint of a younger child. The move to California does not prove to be the salvation of the family. If anything it only worsens the situation. Don Miguel's drinking and womanizing continue, Beatriz faces the stress in the only way she can, at last she takes her Elliie, Lupita and Marta and returns to Ruby. Beatriz went right to work in a tomato packing shed and then began selling cosmetics door to door. Beatriz has found her calling soon has a thriving cosmetics business underway. Marta married in 1962. She and Daniel moved to California and lived with Don Miguel for a time before moving back to Texas where Daniel became a successful grocer with a chain of stores. Raul the only son became an officer in the Air Force.<br />The Caballeros of Ruby, Texas is a poignant tale presenting an engaging glimpse into the ethnicity and way of life of a significant portion of our society. Writer Massey illustrates the restraints felt by both young and older Hispanic women living here in the United States during the years following World War II. Massey demonstrates how these restrictions work both to the hindrance and advantage of the women involved. Of the ministrations of a patriarchal husband or parent can be repressing, but especially for daughters there is security to be had when dad has the final say in many aspects of her life. <br />Massey has a canny knack for taking the mundane and weaving a tale of outstanding proportions. The Caballero family is like so many I have know from my growing up days and early teaching days in the San Joaquin Valley, California.<br />Writer Massey only improves her skill as a writer. The Caballeros of Ruby, Texas is a charismatic, well-written work filled with powerful, well fleshed characters. Each of the women is a person in her own right. Massey adroitly captures the spirit ound in all family situations whether good, bad or somewhere in between. I like Massey's presentation with the three daughters each speaking from their own viewpoint. No one perspective really presents a true picture of anything. The story of Don Miguel and his doleful downward slide is much more believable when seen through the eyes of his three daughters.<br />Excellent read......... happy to recommend<br />Reviewed by: molly martin h
Strange happenings are taking place in the Ozarks. Doc Barnes and his hound Lucky are missing, The Conner Brothers are strange beyond belief and frightening as heck to kids in the area, and Buzzard Thompson has sure enough killed his whole family with a shotgun. Fifteen year old Tommy Benson is determined to face down his fears ...... by going camping with younger brother Dub down at Blue Hole. Blue Hole is where Tommy got bitten last year, 1949, by two cottonmouths when he and Pa and Uncle Ira were camping there. Dub is a real pain in the neck of a 12 year old brother. Tommy and Dub run into the Conner Brothers, manage to locate both Buzzard and Doc Barnes and find Lucky tied to belt of the drowned body of the corpse stuck down in Blue Hole before their frightening campout comes to an end.<br />Think Mark Twain and a whole lot of Southern humor a la Lewis Grizzard and you have The Blue Hole. Rolland Love has really captured the flavor of 'two not quite adult' brothers out for a campout and the scare of their lives. Reminds me of my own two kids at this age. The Blue Hole is a fast paced, page flipper of a read. Writer Love captures the interest of the reader right from the start, and while this book is listed as Young Adult, it is a 'not to be missed' by those who savored and continue to savor every moment with Tom and Huck and Grizzard's Catfish!<br />Writer Love fills his pages with engaging characters, absorbing situations and enough mystery and inexplicable to keep the reader engaged. Tommy's worry about finding family friend Doc Barnes is touching. Dub's stumble foot behavior is something every parent who has housed a twelve year old knows and loves. Writer Love has really captured the essence of both striplings as he weaves his tale of two youngsters who know they must rely upon themselves when they are confronted with fearful situations and frightening people. The boys' behavior, reactions and ultimate decisions are so very typical of kids this age.<br />Excellent Read! Happy to recommend<br />Reviewed by: molly martin

Writer Lorrah presents a well crafted work filled with good writing, fiduciary situations and characters, thought provoking situation and stimulating dialogue. Blood Will Tell is an appealing amalgam of romance, science fiction, and police procedure in which solidly punctilious main characters exhibit great strength of character in the face of impossible situation. Blood Will Tell stands in the class of P.N. Elrod's vampire mysteries.<br />Writer Lorrah sets the stage for excitement from the opening paragraph then carries the reader on a roller coaster of excitement right to the last page. Blood Will Tell is not a narrative for a dark stormy night alone when the lights are flickering and the reader is home alone. <br />Reviewed by: molly martin
Houston Police Officer Mickey Ascherfeld suffered the horrendous death of her parents as a teen. Years later in Houston, Mickey once more faces a merciless foe that leaves her brutalized and unsure what to do. When Mickey receives a letter from old friend inviting her to Alaska she finally decides to go. <br />Four years later, McCray, Alaska is proving to be a healing refuge to the woman who now pursues stained glass as an outlet for pent up stress. The tiny settlement provides the slow pace of life that Mickey needs to get her life back together. Then without warning the town oddball Eldred Hoskins ensures Mickey's life will take another drastic turn. She must use every bit of police training to keep herself and a local teenager alive. <br />Writer McGrew has outdone himself with his first foray into writing. COLD HEART is a fast paced work filled with short snappy chapters presenting a tale that is mostly confined to a time period of four hours. The tightly drawn, fear-inspiring suspense thriller is jam packed with gore, chills, a maddened killer and a bit of a surprise as to what has set old El off. The inaccessibility of the hamlet lends to feelings that escape is impossible and that the people living in the area must either find a way to stop the mad man or be annihilated. <br />Some characters are not fleshed out as completely as might be. What might have led to El's frenzy is not foretold in subtle clues. The surprise causation for El's behavior is not quite as trustworthy as would be, had a few perspicacious hints and red herrings been tossed into the mix during the period leading up to the rampage.<br />Writer McGrew does throw in an abundance of turns and twists. The book is sure to please all who enjoy a good suspense filled, action packed read. Despite the small omissions surrounding El and his lapse of reality COLD HEART is an entertaining read, perfect for a winter afternoon in front of the fireplace.<br />Reviewed by: molly martin
Finger Puppet illustrations with a chapter on how to use them and patterns for making the moppets are all included in this engaging work produced by long time children's advocate Violet Toler. Charles Quincy Churchmouse, is the top mouse so to speak and is included in each of Toler's scripts. Toler includes suggestions for choice of puppeteers as well as how to make puppets. A nice collection of story scripts are included. Scripts are simple, to the point, easy for the novice to use successfully for teaching young children truths, values, and religious tenets. The first nine scripts feature Charlie, the second nine Charlie and Lizzie, the next nine Charlie and Grandpa Joe and the final nine Charlie and Mary. The book finishes up with how to contact information and author biography. Unfortunately I found the links in the PDF do not take the reader to the sites.<br />Churchmouse Tales is a nice work presented by writer Toler for use in libraries, schools, churches and camp meetings. Illustrations and patterns included in Churchmouse Tales are nicely drawn, easy to follow, will produce credible little mice for the reader's use. Language used for both the text and scripts is geared well, children will not be bored by `preachy' messages. Adult readers do not feel `spoken down to.'<br />This book will make a nice addition to the church, home and school library.<br />Enjoyed the read. Happy to recommend.<br />Reviewed by: molly martin
Calling Crow is tormented with persistent images of an obliterating entity who will come to annihilate his people. This inaugural in a historical trilogy opens with Calling Crow living in his village and wondering what the esoteric cloud ships he sees far out on the ocean may mean. The Spanish who travel in the conveyances have only rascality on their minds. Calling Crow learns the full intent of the voyagers when he is captured by men from one of the cloud ships.<br />For four years Calling Crow is held prisoner, sufferers much and at last makes good his escape from their clutches. His return to his home village brings little contentment for him; the woman to whom he was affianced has married another, and as problems swell within the population the villagers begin to view him with broadening misgiving. The skepticism increases as villagers begin to die from a inexplicable affliction. At last Calling Crow is pursued out to sea where he sets his course once again for the land where he had been held captive.<br />Excellent well written account of the earliest citizens along our eastern coastline. Calling Crow is the first in a historical trilogy; it is set in the year 1555 along the South Carolina coast. Writer Clayton has constructed a penetrating adventure thriller sure to dominate the attention of all who are interested in descriptive historical novels. <br />I am a long time student of history and am pleased to find writer Clayton's research into the era to be evident in his narrative Calling Crow. Clayton's his writing skills are superb as he winds a fascinating tale peopled with characters who are very real and very believable. Combining the wealth of research found in Eric Balkan's City of Tears with the intriguing thrill set down in Gold in The Shadow by Michael Marcotte, Calling Crow is a gripping `can't put it down until the end' read. <br />The publication is accessible for download, and is on paper.<br />Reviewed by: Molly Martin
Kevin works for Dick Rogers. The relationship could be better. Every relationship in Kevin's life could be better. Between his work at Loon Animation, rushing to catch the train at Grand Central and drinking more than anyone should drink Kevin's life is difficult at best. Kevin's latest honey Lucy is a (drug addict), he is only mildly bothered. They stumbled over one another in an alley, what more could be expected? Then she is found on the street, beaten to death, and he is alone again. The worrisome thing for Kevin is that death becomes a regular happening for those associated with the comic animation firm. Kevin isn't real sure just what he should do. The police stumble all over their feet before they finally begin to have a pretty good idea who the culprit might be. <br />Writer Diamond's Crashing Out The Alphabets is a hard hitting, fast paced tear through the wreckage we humans often leave in our wake. Diamond's characters are not always very pretty or likeable, but they sure are believable. Both the dialogue between the various players, and their behavior toward one another is painful to take at times. Kevin's disintegration as a person is awful to watch even as he enjoys success in his work. <br />Diamond has crafted an intriguing work filled with well fleshed out characters, human dilemma and near insurmountable difficulty. The volume is not meant to be a lighthearted romp for a lazy afternoon. This is a hit `em hard, hit `em often, leave them gasping read from opening page right on to the last paragraph. <br />Crashing Out The Alphabets is not a book for the faint of heart, or those easily affronted. The language is raw, gritty and well suited to the character's depicted and situations portrayed in the work. Some obscenity, some graphic sex...
Good book but too many false statements.<BR>A BETTER read would be &quot;Islam Exposed&quot; by Solomon Tulbure
What you will learn from this book:<br />Israel is one of the smallest countries on earth. it is also the most technologically advanced nation on earth, per capita.<br />It has thrived while forced to sustain a military might due to the Arab thread. Compared to the Arab world, Israel has no natural resources. It has no oil, it has no real underground minerals. But it is advanced and successful because it has a love for freedom and democracy. It has thrived because it does not follow the teachings of savages. It may also be a surprise to most that Israel has one of the top ten most respected Supreme Courts in the world.<br />The Arab world on the other hand is huge with some 22 countries and yet the Arabs have yet to even scratch the surface when it comes to civil rights, technological advancement and social justice.<br />Muslim theocratic rule has failed just as Christian theocratic rule has failed world wide and is continuing to. Life liberty and pursuit of happiness is not in the Muslim vocabulary. What is in their vocabulary is to dress like a 6th century savage and live like him too. That is the extent of Muslim prosperity. The Arabs do not hate America because of our policies, they hate us because they are jealous of our superior intellect, period! We are a direct threat to the savage way of life in the Muslim world and we are a direct thread to the Muslim leaders who are incompetent fools.

Making poetry out of pain is as old as humanity, but seldom is it done as elegantly as the terse, unsentimental verse of Melyssa Sprott.  \\"Descent into the Dark\\" dares to go into areas sometimes avoided by poetry-those of abuse, suicide attempts, and the desire for revenge.  Sprott marches into these black areas of hate, loneliness and despair, goes to the deepest, darkest parts and stares them down without apology, without excuses or asking for pity.  This poet asks,  \\"WHY?\\" and then dissects the reasons from a number of moods and other vantage points.<br />The horrible abuse, morbid revelations and thoughts in these poems are delivered in a straightforward, but eerily elegant manner.  This poet uses rhyming couplets much the way Edgar Allen Poe or Algernon Swineburne used rhyming verse to lure listeners into their shadowy worlds.  Yet somehow, Sprott avoids the trite singsong sounds of some rhyming poetry.  Her verse falls more gently on the ear - much like an unexpected secret whispered into your ear or a desperate, late night phone call from a friend.<br />I was drawn in by Sprott's poems and moved by them.  Her unflinching honesty, and the way she tells the reader about abuse, pain, and the light and dark sides of herself is immensely refreshing.  The voice in this collection of poems is not that of a victim, but of a survivor, who embraces herself in all her imperfect humanity.  These poems are deeply felt, written from a place without light or hope. Ultimately, however, Sprott leads us out of the bottom of the labyrinth - out to a place of new possibilities and the few good things that in the end save us all.  She dares sentiment-thanks the people who helped her through and finds a reason, for the sake of her children, to choose life over death.<br />It is hard to say you LOVE a collection of poems about such sore and heart-breaking experiences, but this is a valuable collection of poems and well worth the read.  It is also an inspirational book for anyone who ever felt this way or to give to someone you know who is also trying to survive.  I came out of reading this with a new perspective on what people go through and remembered some of my own darker moments.  Whenever a book can do this for a reader, it's exceptional!

Excellent book. Well written, easily read, thought provoking. Is long, but not cumbersome. <br />I first read 'About Face' written by Col. David Hackworth during the late 1980s.

Harrys wife Janet turns to Lottie Baldwin, the one person she is sure can help when Harry goes missing. The two women find themselves rushing headlong into danger when they decide the police are moving too slowly in finding out what has become of Harry. Flamboyant Lottie Baldwin blew into Cheyenne, North Dakota following the end of a romance she would just as soon forget. The Tarot reading psychics abilities are dismissed by everyone in town except for her old college chum Janet Larson. Even Lotties sweetie, sheriffs sergeant Harlan Erikson is unwilling to accept that Lotties expertise is valid until he finds he has no choice but to rely on her feelings when Harry and Janets young daughter is kidnapped. <br />Fatal Fortune a first mystery thriller by Kansas writer Elizabeth Delisi is a keep you turning the page read.

Patricia Miles finds herself trapped in a loveless marriage. Her husband Danny appears to have little interest in life other than his hobby of astronomy. Danny Mile's absorption for astrophysical matters coupled with his almost total detachment from Trish are causing her enormous anguish. Trish's loneliness drives her into the arms of a former college professor while her phobic fear of butterflies causes Trish to seek the services of Dr. Joy Canova. Hidden to Trish is the fact that Dr. Canova's patients have begun to fall victim to an unbalanced murderer. Inspector Terry is once more on the case in this intricate tracery of obscurity, murder and a skate along the edges of rationality.<br />One more superb offering by writer Spindler FACES OF FEAR is the second in her 'Inspector Terry' series. The chronicle is an opulent concoction filled with charismatic people who are beleaguered with the warts and bumps that shape us as individuals. Each of German born Christine Spindler's characters is believable, and is easy to like or to at least develop empathy with for their plight in life. Even the sinister murderer is a character hard to dislike. The several separate strands of the narrative are ingeniously woven together to form a gripping account which will hold the reader's interest from start to finish.<br />Suggestive of the drama found in 'Since All Is Passing' by Elizabeth Delisi and filled with the passion offered by Iris Leach in 'No Good Without You'<br />FACES OF FEAR is a 'keep you turning the page' read. The distress exhibited by Trish is obvious and credible. Dr. Canova's desperation driven behavior keeps us sitting on the edge of the seat. Trish's new lover, Lionel, (Leo) Croft divorced his former wife because she had a drinking problem. Neither the besotted woman nor her former husband have a clue as to the torment suffered by Cameron their only child. The interlaced personal issues as Dr. Canova attempts to help her patients work through their phobias evenas she is sorting our her own hidden gremlins are to be found in this complex, well wrought thriller by this previously published writer. Spindler's adroitness for the interaction that takes place between people and her eloquent account absorb the reader right into the anecdote.<br />Excellent, captivating read. Highly recommended.<br />Reviewed by: molly martin
Betsy Craig began her career in the little Kansas town Spring Water where as a young reporter she quickly learned that small town mentality and the 'good old boy' syndrome was alive, well and going to cause her trouble. Betsy's boss Bob Parker is unreasonable in his firing of Betsy because a local rowdy muttered a swear word into the open mic during an interview. Parker tells Betsy that were she a man the incident would never have taken place.

This book is simply a must read!
Betsy Craig began her career in the little Kansas town Spring Water where as a young reporter she quickly learned that small town mentality and the 'good old boy' syndrome was alive, well and going to cause her trouble. Betsy's boss Bob Parker is unreasonable in his firing of Betsy because a local rowdy muttered a swear word into the open mic during an interview. Parker tells Betsy that were she a man the incident would never have taken place. When Betsy seeks legal recourse she finds herself facing a brick wall and decides to leave Kansas for the opportunities she hopes will be greater in Pennsylvania.<br />Fourteen years pass and Dr Craig, Professor at Mountain View University is up for tenure. Betsy has taught journalism and broadcasting at the school for six years, has begun a growing relationship with the Dean of English, Todd Baker and feels her life is on a positive track. She is aghast when the retention Committee turn down her tenure because her immediate boss Dr Steve Harding has not sent a letter supporting tenure for Betsy. <br />Betsy is dismayed to learn that Steve's supervisor Dean Chambers is determined to get rid of her and has put pressure on Steve to withhold his support for her. Betsy suspects that her relationship with Todd may be part of the underlying cause for what has happened. Chambers' secretary is a woman who would like to continue the relationship she and Todd enjoyed prior to Betsy. As if this were not enough Betsy is soon scrutinized because of attention she receives from ROTC director Mike Kelly. <br />Mountain View is a borough steeped in its heritage.

Patricia Miles finds herself trapped in a loveless marriage. Her husband Danny appears to have little interest in life other than his hobby of astronomy. Danny Mile's absorption for astrophysical matters coupled with his almost total detachment from Trish are causing her enormous anguish. Trish's loneliness drives her into the arms of a former college professor while her phobic fear of butterflies causes Trish to seek the services of Dr. Joy Canova. Hidden to Trish is the fact that Dr. Canova's patients have begun to fall victim to an unbalanced murderer. Inspector Terry is once more on the case in this intricate tracery of obscurity, murder and a skate along the edges of rationality.<br />One more superb offering by writer Spindler FACES OF FEAR is the second in her 'Inspector Terry' series. The chronicle is an opulent concoction filled with charismatic people who are beleaguered with the warts and bumps that shape us as individuals. Each of German born Christine Spindler's characters is believable, and is easy to like or to at least develop empathy with for their plight in life. Even the sinister murderer is a character hard to dislike. The several separate strands of the narrative are ingeniously woven together to form a gripping account which will hold the reader's interest from start to finish.<br />Suggestive of the drama found in 'Since All Is Passing' by Elizabeth Delisi and filled with the passion offered by Iris Leach in 'No Good Without You'<br />FACES OF FEAR is a 'keep you turning the page' read. The distress exhibited by Trish is obvious and credible. Dr. Canova's desperation driven behavior keeps us sitting on the edge of the seat. Trish's new lover, Lionel, (Leo) Croft divorced his former wife because she had a drinking problem. Neither the besotted woman nor her former husband have a clue as to the torment suffered by Cameron their only child. The interlaced personal issues as Dr. Canova attempts to help her patients work through their phobias evenas she is sorting our her own hidden gremlins are to be found in this complex, well wrought thriller by this previously published writer. Spindler's adroitness for the interaction that takes place between people and her eloquent account absorb the reader right into the anecdote.<br />Excellent, captivating read. Highly recommended.<br />Reviewed by: molly martin

Writer Wendy Laing has taken an actual lighthouse where she has been a guest at the lighthouse keeper's cottage: The Cape Otway in Victoria, Australia as the starting point for her nicely wrought tale, and she has woven an entertaining book of eight chapters for early readers. Through the magic of a time tunnel children Aaron and Gracie Brandon are taken to a long ago time where they meet a marvelous old Scottish sea captain's ghost. The pair had been less than enthralled while vacationing with their parents to discover the old lighthouse where they are staying has no video games or anything else interesting for them to do. And, then they meet Captain Angus! When they do everything changes. Cap'n Angus takes the pair on virtual reality trips sailing on masted ships, with opportunity for meeting one of their ancestors along with watching a sea rescue and other adventures. <br />Wendy Laing has done it again! This talented writer continues to produce excellently written, well researched materials sure to be used in the classroom and for home reading alike. Captain Angus, the Lighthouse Ghost is an inviting venture for children sure to keep youngsters entertained as they travel through the interactive links allowing them to make a voyage through the internet. Writer Laing really understands how to make history come alive for young readers. Children will make stops at sites where they can tour old ships, discover lighthouses and learn a little about them in the process. Young readers are sure to enjoy following the links and learning a little of history without their realizing they are doing so. Captain Angus, the Light House Ghost is a delightful guide children are sure to like. The Links to sites will pique their curiosity.<br />Chapter titles include: Cap'n Angus, Spirits and Ghosts, Land Ahoy!, Rescue!, The Tower, Ship Ahoy!, Aurora's Spirit, A Light in the Future and The Beacon of Hope. Captain Angus, the Light House Ghost is a read to book for the younger set. Assuch it provides a marvelous opportunity for quality parent child time as they sit together at the computer reading and traveling the links to various sites. Older children will enjoy reading and manipulating the work themselves.<br />The only thing I find lacking from a teacher standpoint, and in no way detracts from the delightful tale itself: I like to see a target audience noted and the word/vocabulary list at the end of the books I use in the classroom when possible. These just make it easier for teachers, and parent home teachers too to quickly decide if this book will fit into our particular teaching need at the moment.<br />Reviewed by: molly martin
The Problem of God explores God as Completely Perfect, the Unmoved Mover, the Uncaused Cause, the Creator Ex Nihilo, the Necessary Being, the Cosmic Mind, and as All-Good and Omnipotent.
While other author] goes back to Anselm and Aquinas, this book previews mostly post-1500 theodicy, while still getting the ontological argument from Anselm an a posteriori cosmological arguments largely ascribed to Aquinas. The full spectrum of the arguments for and against God are here: first, in a brief exposition of a philosopher from the past, then in an analysis of where the philosopher's strengths and weaknesses lie. There is even a section on the most notorious of all arguments against the existence of God: the existence of evil. Overall, this book makes a significant contribution to beginning philosophy students who want a rigorous examination of the crucial questions of God's existence and non-existence. The writing is clear, concise, coherent, and exceptionally well-constructed. Mackie is must reading for all serious philosophers of religion.
Is a God concept really necessary for humans to enjoy a sense of significance and a life of value and dedication? Does human kind really live in a purposeful universe with a divine creator, upon which we can rely to reshape things to come? These questions and many others have been pondered for centuries by the great minds in their day. This noted collection of essays rejects the view that moral values and human purpose require divine sanction. <BR>Critiques Of God is the only collection of writings to present, in a comprehensive way, the case against belief in God. The arguments for God's existence, the validity of mystical experience, and the importance of the God concept for the development of morality and meaning in life are critically evaluated by sixteen well-known philosophers and psychologists. Included are works by Kurt Baier, John Dewey, Paul Edwards, Antony Flew, Sigmund Freud, Erich Fromm, Sidney Hook, Walter Kaufmann, Corliss Lamont, Wallace I. Matson, H. J. McCloskey, Ernest Nagel, Kai Nielsen, Richard Robinson, Bertrand Russell, and Michael Scriven. <BR>In no other volume are the most fundamental questions of religion explored with such force and conviction. Included are discussions of the meaning of the existence of God, the relationships between faith and mysticism, reason and science, fate, the problem of evil, ethics without God, and immortality. <BR>Peter A. Angeles is retired from the Philosophy Department at Santa Barbara City College (California). He is the author of The Problem Of God: A Short Introduction.
A VERY complex but easy to follow fantacy/mystery.<BR>The author is brilliant. His characters well developed and the enviornment well depicted.
A collection of independent essays by the reknown and well-respected philosopher Antony Flew on God, freedom, and immortality. The essays on &quot;The Presumption of Atheism&quot; and &quot;The Principle of Agnosticism&quot; are especially good.
Reviewer Will Murphy: &quot;First of all, this work was not written by Jean Meslier, and the real title is not 'Superstition In All Ages.' In reality, this work is Baron d'Holbach's masterpiece, 'Good' or 'Common Sense.' Due to the severe restrictions on the press in the 18th century, d'Holbach published virtually all of his work under the names of famous dead people. Amazingly, the only edition of this fine work that is still in print does not even credit the real author of the work! Nevertheless, the substance of the book is the same. To be honest, this is one of the best atheist tracts ever written. It is a more cogent presentation of the ideas that Holbach set forth in his famous 'System of Nature.' He completely destroys any rationale for 'God,' or anything else of the supernatural bent. He relentlessly attacks Christian dogma, revealing just how truly absurd it is. Moreover, he also demonstrates how harmful religion has been to individuals and to societies, and why it is a highly immoral force. Overall, this is still a devastating and profound exposition of atheist ideas. Although I agree with most of his ideas, I must admit that I am not inclined to follow his materialism or determinism/fatalism. Beyond this, I would recommend this work to both atheists and theists alike. The former will be exposed to some refreshing ideas, and the latter will surely be in for quite the shock, as their superstitions will be thoroughly undermined, if of course, they make use of their rational faculites.&quot;
Drange has written what I believe to be the best statement of the Argument from Evil (AE) ever, and he also introduces, for the first time, the Argument from Non-Belief (ANB). This book is just brilliant. Drange is meticulous and logical; he leaves no stone unturned. The book is divided into two parts. One devoted to AE, the other to ANB. The book also contains apendixes that deal with interesting issues like free will. <br />Drange applies AE to four definitions of God: evangelical and liberal Xianity, and Orthodox and liberal Judaism. He culls definitions from the Bible, which is where he looks for answers to what God would most likely desire, i.e., to have people believe in him (for example). This helps Drange to get around the difficult issue of: How do we know God really wants to prevent evil? or whatever. Using the Bible as a resource was both a refreshing way of looking at AE, and a bit of a teaching experience about the Bible. <br />Often Drange argues conservatively. Even when I thought his arguments were much more forceful, he heald back. His statement of objections and attempts to reply are riddled with these principles of fairness: Far from being un-balanced, I was somewhat annoyed that Drange appeared to give his opponents more credibility than they deserved. This just shows his desire to be fair and balanced, and by the end of the book I had realized two things. <br />First, AE isn't as strong as many people think it is, once we are no longer discussing the prima facie absurd god of evangelical Xianity. Second, Drange's conservative style of arguing actually makes his arguments that much stronger: you know that he's trying to be fair, and his writing illicits trust from the reader. <br />ANB is actually much stronger than AE, according to Drange. I won't discuss the argument here. It may be that ANB is stronger only because this book is its first showing to the philosophical community: theists will respond in time. But the fairness and meticulous argumentation that was used with AE is used with ANB as well. <br />This book is simply a must have. Both for its brilliant statement of AE and its promulgation of the very powerful ANB.
In a lively debate, which includes questions from the audience, Christian philosopher and ethicist J.P. Moreland and Kai Neilsen, one of today's best-known atheist philosophers, go head to head on the fundamental issues and questions that have shaped individual lives, races, and nations throughout history. After the debate, several contributors from both sides chip in with their evaluations and arguments. <br />In a lively debate, which includes questions from the audience, Christian philosopher and ethicist J.P.

Comfort can be taken in the acknowledgement that many &quot;theologians and religious philosophers now openly state, that religion is a 'blik', a perspective, an attitude, a way of looking at the world, rather than a descriptive account of how reality actually is.&quot; Thrower also clarified for me the thought that I have always had that &quot;atheism&quot; is not a satisfactory description of my own philosophy of life. &quot;For if the assertion that there is a god is nonsensical, then the atheist's assertion that there is no god is equally nonsensical, since it is only a significant proposition that can be significantly contradicted.&quot; Which implies that agnosticism is also ruled out. Instinctively, I have referred to myself as a non-theist rather than atheist. After reading Thrower, I am even more comfortable referring to myself as an unbeliever or Humanist without any further qualifications. <br />I highly recommend this book for those who are either theist or humanist in their belief because it gives a wonderful overview of the history of these two different views of our human awareness. For the theist, it provides a fresh look at the &quot;old arguments&quot; against religion and will help to sharpen or deepen your faith (since I doubt those of true faith will be persuaded against their faith by a review of atheism's history). For the humanist, it will provide roots for your own life philosophy. An excellent addition to both libraries!
A mystery novel like no other.<BR>You have to read it if you are a mystery fan.<BR>It is absolutely excellent!
A must read! Pure and simple!
The existence of evil - undeserved human and animal pain and suffering - has been a barrier to religious belief for many people. One of those people was this reviewer's mother, raised Catholic but turned atheist after witnessing terrible suffering in her native Scotland during World War II. As she once told me, &quot;when you've seen mothers holding their children, both riddled with machine gun bullets from German planes, it's impossible to believe there's a good God in heaven&quot;. Bertrand Russell once made the comment that &quot;no one can believe in a good God if they've sat at the bedside of a dying child.&quot; <br />C.S. Lewis called this issue &quot;The Problem of Pain&quot; in his book of that title. The current preferred term is &quot;The Evidential Argument From Evil&quot; because, as explained in the Introduction, it's not a &quot;Problem&quot; except for people who believe in God. <br />Readers of this book will discover why belief in an all-good, all-powerful God, in the face of human suffering and evil, is not necessarily &quot;cognitively dissonant&quot;. It provides a balanced, fair treatment of the issue by both believers and atheists. <br />The book is quite technical at times. Several of the essays feature complex equations purporting to illustrate various logical propositions. There is also a good deal of philosophical jargon used. Nonetheless, while the book is not as readable as anything by C.S. Lewis (or Ayn Rand for that matter), it provides the best treatment I've seen in print of the arguments for both sides in this perennial issue.
When did atheism first appear in America? Why did many of the Founding Fathers become deists? Are atheism and deism a threat to the Christian, Jewish, and Moslem religions? <br />The book not only attempts to answer these questions, but also explores the influence of such philosophers as Epicurus, Marcus Aurelius and Voltaire on American leaders. You will meet not only Ralph Waldo Emerson, Henry David Thoreau, Ralph Ingersoll, and Clarence Darrow, but also Fanny Wright, an atheist whom Thomas Jefferson invited to Monticello and Andrew Jackson invited to the Hermitage. <br />Finally, the book examines why atheism has never become more than a fringe belief in this country, as contrasted with much greater popularity in Europe, and whether it will have more influence in future years.
I have never read a book with as many twists and turns.<BR>This book is Excellent and worth its weight in gold.
The typical excuse everyone seems to come up with is that the 9-11 terrorists were not real Muslims. That they are part of a fringe and extreme element not recognized by the \\"real Islam\\" etc. THIS IS NOT TRUE! <br />To locate the origins of anti-American sentiment, Islamic scholar Tulbure maps the history of Muslim anxiety towards the West from the time of the Crusades through European imperialism, and explains how Islam itself is jealous of what it wants to claim for itself-world domination.<br />For a Muslim, politics and religion are inextricable, and followers possess an acute knowledge of their own history dating back to the Prophet Mohammed,  but Muslims lack any real understanding of the West. In this book you will find what other authors are AFRAID to say or put into print. You no longer need to waste your money on highly promoted books to learn all there is to learn about the CORE of Islam. Tulbure lays it all down in such a fashion that it gets hard to put the book down once you start reading it.
A Sci-Fi fan's dream book! Look for this book to be made into a movie on the sci-fi channel.<br />Very awsome futuristic science fiction!

A thought provoking fantacy fiction.<BR>You must read the first two books though.<br />Very powerful writing!
A collection of stories but also a great insight into the scince and  fiction trends.
A romance novel and a mystery novel in one book.<BR>If you like twisted and mysterious romance novels this book is great!<br />I loved it!
Chances are the future of mankind will be very much as is depicted in this very powerful futuristic work of fiction!<br />It will leave you breathless and wishing you lived for another 2000 years!
A very promissing book with a very sweet romance theme.
Michael Martin's collection of short stories is unique, there can be no doubt. I cannot name another popular fictional book that is inspired by the same subject matter - atheism. There are probably other books that do have an atheistic theme, but Martin attempts to make a case for non belief through entertaining short stories that ranged from absolutely touching to incredibly clever. Unfortunately, one may be forced to think a great deal while reading, and a dogmatic orientation will render this book impossible to read. That's their problem. For those who do not mind a challenge, in a number of ways, try this rational alternative to CS Lewis. THIS will make sense.
They are going to make a movie based on this book rest assured!<BR>The book is addictive and will leave you in suspense. You will feel hurt when you are done reading it because you will wish it does not end.
Andrew Cronan from Philadelphia, PA <BR>Dr. Weisberger's book is a concise yet precise examination of the age-old but apparently intractable Problem of Evil. Most astute here is the author's assertion that the burden of proof lies with the Theist. That is, since all the premises of the inconsistent triad are those asserted by the Theist and all previous attempts to resolve the inconsistency fail, the intractability of the Problem endures. While the traditional discussion is accurately and interestingly presented, some current contributions are also examined. Plantinga's theodicy rightly receives very little attention while Hick's epistemic distance and Dore's revised soulmaking are the subject of thorough treatment. Chapter Six, with its attention to the &quot;Pollution Solution,&quot; includes treatment of a version previously unknown to this reader. Here again Weisberger demonstrates the pitfalls of such a proposed solution. Any rational thinker concerned with the Western God cannot avoid this book.
Gale's book is introduced as a critical response to the analytic arguments offered by Plantinga, Swinburne, Alston, and others. He begins by discussing several atheological arguments, which he uses to clarify the nature of God's attributes instead of refuting God's existence. He then proceeds to refute different versions of ontological, cosmological, religious-experience, and pragmatic arguments for God's existence. Technical, yet very witty. Recommended reading for anyone with an academic interest in the philosophy of religion. <br />Richard Gale taught my philosophy of religion class at the University of Pittsburgh and used this book as one of the texts. He is an acute reasoner and this book reflects his ability to tear apart arguments that otherwise seem unassailable. A word to the wise who wish to read the book: Gale uses modal logic pretty extensively in parts so be forewarned if the subject gives you problems. --Matt Hunt

Short Excerpt:<BR>Chapter 17. Islam: Sex With Babies and Animals is Okay<br />Here are a few excerpts from the book of Islam's supreme spiritual leader, Ayatollah Khomeini:<br />\\"A man can have sexual pleasure from a child as young as a baby. However he should not penetrate, sodomizing the child is OK. If the man penetrates and damages the child then he should be responsible for her subsistence all her life. This girl however does not count as one of his four permanent wives. The man will not be eligible to marry the girl's sister.\\" From Khomeini's book, Tahrirolvasyleh, fourth volume, Darol Elm, Gom, Iran, 1990 <br />\\"It is better for a girl to marry in such a time when she would begin menstruation at her husband's house rather than her father's home. Any father marrying his daughter so young will have a permanent place in heaven.\\" From Khomeini's book, Tahrirolvasyleh, fourth volume, Darol Elm, Gom, Iran, 1990 <br />\\"Young boys\\" are apparently not off-limits, either. When it comes to the rewards in heaven Muslim men will receive, some of the rewards are young boys for them to enjoy in sexual ways: <br />Koran, 52:24: \\"And there shall wait on them [the Muslim men] young boys of their own, as fair as virgin pearls.\\" <br />Koran, 76:19: \\"They shall be attended by boys graced with eternal youth, who will seem like scattered pearls to the beholders.\\" <br />Ayatollah Khomeini also wrote about sex with animals:<br />\\"A man can have sex with animals such as sheep¬πs, cows, camels and so on. However, he should kill the animal after he has his orgasm. He should not sell the meat to the people in his own village; however selling the meat to the next-door village should be fine.\\" From Khomeini's book, Tahrirolvasyleh, fourth volume, Darol Elm, Gom, Iran, 1990 <BR>\\"If one commits the act of sodomy with a cow, a ewe, or a camel, their urine and their excrements become impure, and even their milk may no longer be consumed. The animal must then be killed and as quickly as possible and burned.\\" From The Little Green Book, Sayings of Ayatollah Khomeini, Political, Philosophical, Social and Religious with a special introduction by Clive Irving, ISBN number 0-553-14032-9, page 47 <br />Muslims sometimes also practice animal sacrifice. In the Hadith, Mohammed actually suggested it as one of three possible treatments for lice Sahih al-Bukhari, Volume 5, Book 59, Number 503.) However, today it is practiced as part of a ritual called the Zar. According to Samuel M. Zwemer, F.R.G.S., author of The Influence of Animism on Islam, the Zar is practiced all throughout the Muslim world (and even within non-Muslim religious traditions in Africa). The Zar is basically an exorcism of mischievious demons that possess people. Unlike Christian exorcism, which involves asking God to cast out the offending demon in a battle between good and evil, in Islam, the demons are asked to leave and to take pity on the victim \\"in the right of the Prophet.\\" Although this form of \\"devil worship\\" was denounced by Mohammed as a minor form of polytheism, in Islam it is only considered a minor offense and not at all a rejection of Allah. The Zar is a very elaborate ceremony of pagan origin that culminates in the sacrifice of small animals such as chickens and roosters and the drinking of their blood as they are being killed. <br />I will simply let the above speak for itself. If Islam is peace as president Bush said, then I choose chaos because Islamic peace is not my ideal and vision of peace. The next time Muslims attack America and kill thousands or millions, President Bush should remember that the Muslims are only trying to impose Islam's version of \\"peace.\\"

Chapter 1: In the Beginning, Chapter 2:<br />Arab Imperialism, Chapter 3: What Is Jihad, Chapter 4: Compared to Muslims, Communists are Angels are written in direct, easily understood prose by an author who has obviously done a good bit of research prior to beginning the writing. Chapter 5: The Five Pillars of Islam provides those who have little to know understanding of Islam with some insight into the tenets of the religion.<br />Chapter 6: The Hidden Pillars of Islam , Chapter 7: The Unholy Koran, Chapter 8: The History of the Koran, Chapter 9: The Koran: Miracle of Literary and Numerical Styles? Chapter 10: The Koran: Miracle of Scientific Knowledge? Continue to educate the reader as Dr Tulbure continues his well written treatise.<br />Chapter 11: The Hadith or the sunna of Mohammed which are the guide for Muslim belief and practice provide the reader with more insight into the actual `nuts and bolts' of the religion.<br />Chapter 12: What Loving God? Chapter 13: The Omnipotent God? Chapter 14: Islam on Human Rights keeps up the work as Dr Tulbure broadens his scope into the principles offered in Islam.<br />I found Chapter 15: Islam: Women, the Inferior, Evil Creatures of special interest because I am a woman. Chapter 16: The Slavery of Women In Islam presents some astonishing data for the reader.<br />Chapter 17: Islam: Sex With Babies and Animals is Okay, Chapter 18: Shias vs. Sunnis, the Sectarian Wars Chapter 19: The Muslim Mentality, Chapter 20: The Lack of Islam's Contribution to Humanity, Chapter 21: Mohammed: Model Muslim, Horrible Person Chapter, 22: Morality and Ethics, Chapter 23: The Isreali-Palestinian Conflict Chapter 24: The Clergy of Islam, are filled with the same attention to detail as previous chapters.<br />Chapter 25: Muslims in Non-Muslim Countries, Chapter 26: Muslims and Apostates on the Internet, Chapter27: Possible Solutions, finish the work with Dr Tulbure's thoughts on Muslims today who may live next to us as well as explication for the reader.<br />Writer Tulbure has crafted an interesting work following what must be years of intensive research. Author Tulbure has an excellent understanding of how to the hook the reader, draw them into the work then hold their interest from first paragraph to last page. Often documentaries tend to be dry, dogmatic or argumentative. Write Tulbure has avoided these pitfalls. Careful attention is given to details, using quotes from Islamic writing to provide a basis for his statements and a reluctance for sensationalism.<br />This is not a book to rush through, or read piecemeal. Rather it is a carefully wrought work meant to be read over a period of time with ample time allowed for the reader to assimilate, ponder, perhaps check some of the references and to really inculcate the knowledge Dr Tulbure would like to impart to those who use his book.
Review of Islam Exposed by Lynne H. Schultz<br />If you liked Dr. Solomon Tulbure's earlier book, G. W. Bush Is a Moron: Islam is NOT Peace, then you ought to love his latest offering, Islam Exposed.  It is more than four times longer, and it presents a much more detailed look into the dark side of Islam.  There is also substantial new information on Muslim reformers and apostates.  Although a few of the chapters will seem familiar, Dr. Tulbure has expanded most of those to include new material, and he has also added several all-new and even more exciting chapters.<br />Several chapters cleverly expose the false claims of literary, numerical and scientific \\"miracles\\" in the Koran.  In spite of the teaching that Muslims must seek out knowledge, Islam Exposed shows that most Islamic writers and apologists are quite often very ignorant of modern science.  Islam, as it is practiced in most of the world today, appears to be trapped in an earlier era, without the benefit of the western advances during the Reformation and the Age of Enlightenment.  Little has changed in Islamic culture over the past 500 years.<br />As the book suggests, part of the problem may be that Mohammed is not just the founder of Islam, but is also considered to be the perfect moral role model.  But of course, considered in the light of modern moral values, he is not that at all. Dr. Tulbure uses the Koran, the Hadith and other documents to expose just what sort of person Mohammed really was.<br />Over 40 pages have been added on the status of women in Islam, and its surprising connection to modern forms of slavery in the Muslim world.  In those pages, Dr. Tulbure gives us a detailed look into the abominable lives of many Muslim women.  That chapter, \\"The Slavery of Women in Islam,\\" is truly one of the gems of Islam Exposed. <br />Another real gem of Islam Exposed is the chapter on the Israeli-Palestinian Conflict.  Most of those pages are dedicated to a thorough, objective, but easy to follow, history of the entire conflict from the 3rd millennium B.C.E. to modern times.  Most people would be quite surprised to learn that this battle did not begin in the 20th century, but thousands of years earlier.  This chapter alone would make an excellent book, disclosing just why this conflict appears so intractable.<br />A central theme throughout is the struggle within Islam between democratic values and the oligarchic forces of Islamic theocracy.  It explains how and why political Islamism has managed to marginalize democracy-loving Islam reformers, and what can be done about it.
Bags Out at Seven is a fast paced series of 16 chapters recounting some of the adventures and misadventures experienced by Robert Globerman during his days as a 'travel leader.' Globerman was a teacher twice named Teacher of the Year in Ossining, New York. Following his winning a Fulbright Fellowship and Smith Mundt Grant to teach and train teachers in Israel Globerman found he enjoyed travel so much he founded 'Globetrottours, Inc,' a move which was to provide much grist for his future writing. <br />The book is a tongue-in-cheek autobiographical work in which writer Globerman gives the reader a peek at some of incidents to be expected by the unsuspecting while on tour. Chapter headings include: Debt On The Nile, Cape May or May Not and My Underwear Is All Over The World. Terrible toilets, bus breakdowns, flight problems, all the things that can go wrong on a trip are to be found between the covers of Globerman's book. <br />The reader will meet some delightful travelers as well as those Globerman might have wished had missed the flight. Chapters: A Few Bumps, Strained Bedfellows, and What Will I Miss will keep the reader giggling even as they ponder whether they really want to schedule a trip for themselves anytime soon!<br />Bags Out At Seven: A Tale of Too Many Cities is a real page turner from the opening chapter: From the Halls of Montezuma to the Shores of Trips, right down to the last page of chaper 16: And Now? Tis is a fun romp for a lazy afternoon in the hammock or sitting on the porch in a swing during a gentle rain.<br />-Reviewed by Molly Martin

Depression is a Choice is a documentary, text book type work of 20 chapters in which a woman who is a therapist and well acquainted with depression offers some concrete insight and advice into depression and how to manage it through employing Directed Thought. Curtiss says Directed Thinking is a combination of awareness, understandings, formula thinking, and mind trips applied to depression; my own and others'.<br />Chapter 2 addresses The Myth of Easy in which writer Curtiss points out that perhaps acknowledging that something is difficult somehow calls up the will to do it. Curtiss helps the reader understand that we humans do not have to function from instinct. We are able to choose rather to function from reason. <br />Chapter 9 Depression : The Smoke and Mirrors of the Mind is one in which Curtiss states that while she continues to harbor all of the old fearful feelings she no longer feels powerless before them. She offers succinct methods for helping the reader reach this point as well.<br />I especially enjoyed the humor found in Chapter 19: Working Hard at Keeping Sane. I like the idea that there is no requirement that we must happy in order to get up out of bed and get on with the day.<br />Writer Curtiss presents her work in a very intelligible, readable manner. It is obvious the writer has done her research. She provides clear illustrations, some personal history and lots and lots of endnotes to back up her findings. Depression is a Choice should prove of value for therapist and layman alike as they work to solve their own problems or endeavor to help those suffering from the problem. For those who are suffering from depression they may well find exactly what they need on the pages of Depression is a Choice in order to begin their own climb from the morass. <br />Reviewed by: molly martin
Another maid has been found laying dead on the cliff walk. Or is she, maid that is. <br />A repeat murderer must be at work. Maids have been dying. However, Detective Matt Devlin realizes that while the battered woman lying along the cliff walk is wearing maid's uniform she has hands much too soft and unblemished to be that of a maid. Before long Devlin is thrown together with one of the well-to-do inhabitants of the 'cottages' to work toward the solving of this puzzling mystery. <br />Brooke Cassidy and Devlin had been childhood friends during the years before the death of her working class parents to a carriage accident and Brooke's subsequent leaving of Newport, Rhode Island for a very different life in New York City. Now Brooke is back and living as the ward of her affluent relatives, the Olmsteads. <br />When all the clues begin pointing to Uncle Henry as the murderer, Matt has no choice but to arrest him. Brooke's `damn the torpedoes full steam ahead' tenacity coupled with Matt's superior, thought plodding, investigative ability do uncover the true killer. Their discovery comes too late to prevent the death of another but not before another woman falls prey to the mad man.<br />What an interesting tale is to be found on the pages of Death on The Cliff Walk . <BR>Set in 1895 Death on The Cliff Walk is a suspense filled historical novel. This is a gripping tale filled with intriguing well developed characters, credible dialogue and plenty of uncertainty. Duplicity abounds as the pair works toward solving the conundrum. Brooke as the bemused amateur sleuth is a sensible young woman who knows that she cannot simply live the life of the idle rich as her wealthy relatives want her to do. Rather she is determined to help solve the case. I've known people like this peppy girl! <br />Matt Devlin is the perfect quiet, introspective foil to Brooke's headstrong determination. Kruger's Brooke Cassidy is reminiscent of Brenda Bolden's Bird Series' Alex Masters. Both girls are determined, impatient and intent upon finding answers, right now. It is their willingness to rush forward despite all odds that often brings Cassidy and Masters both face to face with real, personal problems in addition to the one they were trying to solve.<br />Watch those red herrings. Do not fall into their grip or you may find yourself surprised when you reach the last paragraph of this action packed thriller. Good book for a `lazy afternoon on the porch reading day.'<br />I hope this is not the only book in which we will find Matt Devlin and Brooke Cassidy working together to solve a perplexing case.<br />Reviewed by: molly martin
In Seabell, by their choice, a large community of Cambodians live segregated from the rest of the citizenry. Bridget O'Hearn, while not Asian, has come to know the Cambodian people from her work for the SouthEast Asian Assistance Agency. When Hahn Lys and his wife are found dead in their apartment the SEAAA appoint Bridget to serve as liaison between the community and the police. Enter Detective Jack Patrewski. He and O'Hearn set out to unravel the mystery surrounding the deaths and in doing so find themselves embroiled in an even greater mystery. Before long O'Hearn is convinced that the deaths relate back to the old Khmer Rouge days while whispers of bad karma surrounds much of the thinking of the residents. O'Hearn is viewed by many within the community as an unwelcome intruder, while others believe she is a helpful outsider. <br />Death Stalks The Khmer is the well wrought product of writer Harrington, who like her Bridget O'Hearn is well versed in the intricacies of the Cambodian refugees living here in this county. Harrington has peopled her work with a fine assortment of characters. The clash of cultures resulting from transporting a large group of people from their own land to what is considered to be a safer enviornment is presented in a deft manner in this well crafted ethnic mystery. As in life, the old generation presented in Death Stalks The Khmer clings to the old ways while the younger generation yearns to be wholly American. <br />Steinbeck's displaced Okies are evocative of the struggles facing those who fled the terror of Pol Pot and now live in an enviorment very different from that they have always known. This fast paced thriller is reminiscent of the drama found in the works of Dashiell Hammett.
Once, not so long ago ~singers did not require smoke, fireworks, synchronized light and sound shows, floating chairs, and precision dancing to showcase their talent.All they required was a powerful voice and a magnetic presence ~those were the days of With Connie! Once, not so long ago, romance novels did not require excessive sex, violence or coarse language to showcase their merits. All they required was a solid plot, memorable characters and creative imagery ~those were the days of With Love!<BR>Perhaps that is why, With Love, With Connie works!<br />Henaut obviously writes of what he knows; the result is an engaging story peopled with characters who are believable, refreshing and sometimes unique. Robert and Rachel's longterm, long distance romance provides for a creative exploration of the traditional link between New England and the Maritime Provinces. There is an excellent portrayal of the elderly; the reclusive aunts (bouquet) and the manor guests. Trevor is a classic villain; I was surprised by the twist at the end of the novel.This novel does not need violence or sex to make it a worthwhile read! The unusual device of interweaving the effect of Connie Francis' music on their romance works well. The reader will not want this multi-layered `good read' to end.<br />December 12, 1997 is an extraordinary day in Robert Mascaux's life, involving him in a family funeral, his second wedding and a birthday party for a celebrity. <br />This romantic novel begins with a flashback to 1959, in Northumbria, a coastal community in Nova Scotia. Robert, a high school student, resides at the Manor, a private nursing home owned by his parents, Bertha and Camille, immigrants from Belgium. Robert's home life is enriched by his 'foster grandparents', the Manor residents. When Robert becomes a member of a Connie Francis fan club, he begins a lengthy correspondence with Rachel Turner, the club's teenage president, who lives on an estate in Flanders Cove, Connecticut, with her reclusive, artistic aunts, fondly called 'the bouquet'. <br />The reader discovers the enduring power of love through the struggles and triumphs that Robert and Rachel encounter during their friendship, spanning 38 years. The novel depicts the influence that singers can have on their fans and also reveals parallels that can exist between the lives of singers and their admirers. The music of Connie Francis is the thread of continuity for the couple for whom fate, an international border, family responsibilities, and a sinister villain delayed their marriage until December 12, 1997. <br />Like most good novels, this one has co-existing plots that compliment each other and become entwined. Perhaps the characters are one-sided, but they reflect a cross-section of all the people we hope will be a part of our own lives. We all have a Trevor to contend with. We all enjoy music and recognize its influence. We all have favourite entertainers. The use of Connie Francis recalls an age when life supposedly was more innocent. The novel captures life with its joys and sorrows, struggles and triumphs ~it's a delicious slice of life!<BR>\\"Who's Sorry Now?\\" Not the reader!<br />John Donatelli, Jr. a webmaster for a major Connie Francis website said of the novel:<br />\\"Even if you're not a fan of singer Connie Francis, this is a heartwarming, romantic story of the struggles and triumphs that only love can endure and conquer. <br />It also shows how the power of song, sung by a power of a voice can influence our lives. <br />Reading you won't want to put down until the very last word. And then pick it up and read again!\\"

From the opening lines the reader is transported back to the sights, scents and excitement of medieval times. A Whisper of Rosemary is a fascinating, fast paced work sure to keep the reader enthralled. <br />Writer Gleason's vibrant characters presented in A Whisper of Rosemary are well thought out personalities having their own identities and idiosyncrasies. Allegra's sorrow for being forced into a marriage she does not want is palpable. Maris the headstrong daughter of Lord Lareux is a youngster parents can understand. She has no desire to marry, however, her father determines that she will marry Victor D'Arcy. Unfortunately D'Arcy is a man who causes Maris nothing but icy fingers down her spine. Ruthless Bon de Savrille determines that if anyone marries the girl, it shall be he. Dirick of Derkland has no interest in marriage, he has returned home only to avenge the barbarous murder of his father. It is not long before the three young men find themselves caught up in a snarl entwining their fate with at of Maris.<br />The often peppery dialogue writer Gleason employs between the players flows in a natural manner on the pages of A Whisper of Rosemary. Gleason's writing is both powerful, and filled with enough detail to keep the reader's attention rapt. A Whisper of Rosemary is an exciting text which is sure to tickle the fancy of those who enjoy more than just a touch of romance interspersed with a downright fascinating mystery. <br />Writer Gleason has produced this narrative with the intention that all royalties will go to the Cystic Fibrosis Foundation in honor of her son. <br />Reviewed by Molly Martin
Never before have I encountered a ghost I like so much as Sir Jerome Kennington. We should all be so lucky to have a spirit so full of life in our homes. <BR>Three women rent a house in Hampstead that comes furnished with antiques and its own resident earth bound spirit. What follows is a wonderful story of the three living together, as only women can, sharing and supporting each other through career challenges, men troubles and decisions of what to wear. <br />Deirdre Hall is a television show host who falls for a guest rock star. Charlotte Lewis is a photographer who wants desperately to capture the essence of the souls in London, and Natalie Ladd is a painter who ends up wowing the crowds at a gallery showing. In between the inspiring lives these ladies lead, they find the time to make love with their boyfriends, liberate a lab full of test animals and help sort out the mystery that has their ghost remaining on the earthly plain. <br />Jerome was murdered, and he needs to discover why and by whose hand. There is an evolution here of this lost soul. At first he can only be seen by the three women, the first in 200 years to do so. Then he discovers that others can see him as well. He was trapped in the house that at one time was part of his own estate, but as time goes by, with the women to help him, he finds he is able to travel about. Jerome shares with the girls, his understanding of life and death and reincarnation: shocking one of the boyfriends. <br />And then there is Deidre's boyfriend, the rock star, who looks exactly like Jerome. Though he is not a Kennington, it is possible that he is a descendant and turns out to be a clue to a piece of the puzzle. <br />The author has succeeded in bringing a group of friends to life for the reader, even the character who has been dead for so long. Attention to detail is given at just the right moments. The research that was involved, in portraying Jerome's story from the 1800's, was obviously enjoyed by the author, asthe details of the period are wonderfully vibrant. <br />I savored this book to the very end, which turns out to not be the end after all. The second novel, Jerome's Quest, I am told will be available shortly. I look forward to it with much anticipation. <br />Reviewed by: Heather Froeschl

Olympic silver medallist, Sasha Miller, is the darling of the figure skating world. Even the drug scandal associated with her former partner, Lon Morrison, hasn't diluted her popularity or prevented her star from rising to fabled, glorious heights. Oh, her professional reputation has been tarnished by the whispers and innuendos, but Sasha has managed to rise above it all to embrace her childhood dream. Her provocative routines heat up the ice, and defy the conventional expectations of a figure skater: Sasha has a passion for skating, and it shows -- in every shimmy, shake and gracefully executed jump.<br />No one would suspect the saintly Sasha of trafficking in drugs, however. No one, that is, except Special Agent Mick Vinicor of the DEA. Someone in \\"Follies on Ice,\\" the touring show Sasha is a star attraction of, is selling high grade cocaine to junkies (and killing them with the drug's potency), and it's Mick's job to find out who's doin' the selling and then bust their sorry hump. This isn't his idea of an ideal undercover operation, though. Infiltrating the namby-pamby world of figure skaters is giving him the chills, in fact, and thoroughly testing his patience. Miller has gotta be as guilty as sin, but Mick is beginning to question his own judgment.<br />Sure, lusting after his number one suspect is stone-cold stupid, but his gut is trying to tell him that Sasha is innocent...and the intended target of a would-be killer on the prowl.<br />Conflicting loyalties and misplaced trust put Sasha and Mick on the warpath (once Mick's not-so-tiny white lies are exposed for what they are). On Thin Ice has reams and reams of thick, sexual tension to entertain a reader, however, and to compensate for this frustrating failure to communicate. Susan Andersen's Avon romances are by and large lighter, fluffier fare than this dark, somewhat plodding plot of romantic suspense. Night and day style wise, there are still certain commonalities to be found in this middling-to-high octane story: mainly, the spectacular chemistry percolating between Ms. Andersen's hero and heroine.<br />Why, the sensuality level is pea soup thick, and steamy enough to fog melted glass! There's no questioning Mick and Sasha's compatibility as a couple, but there are a few lamentations to be uttered regarding the lack of honesty in their relationship (and the high-handed, alpha male posturing of a vulnerable hero striking out in a knee-jerk reactionary manner). I really can't deny my infatuation with Mick, however, or the appeal of his politically incorrect take-charge attitude. Sasha has plenty of spunk and spirit to combat Mick's free-roaming egotism -- or should that be despotism? -- at any rate. Strain will test the strength of her emotional reserves, however, and create an illusion of fragility, further inciting Mick's protective instincts.<br />On Thin Ice has a thinly stretched suspense subplot that will easily crack under pressure, though, so it's best not to test or tamper with Ms. Andersen's premise. Nimble pacing of the storyline, spectacular sexual sparks, and complex, likeable characterizations make this novel a showstopper, if not an out and out heart stopper.<br />Reviewed by C.L. Jeffries
Anger and Anxiety is presented in eighty-six pages comprising eight chapters plus a well rounded Bibliography. Dr. Bob Rich tells his readers: \\"I have tried hard to make the book easy and enjoyable to read, and to keep the concepts in it non-technical. ... The tools I describe have worked for huge numbers of people whose suffering was eased. ... Don't expect a single-step recovery. You will need weeks, maybe months, of hard work, and even then the bad habits will occasionally return to pester you.\\"<br />Rich then proceeds to extend commendable, solid wisdom regarding phobia and what it takes to withstand the detriment they can cause in our lives. The effects of apprehension and three ways of responding to stress are described in chapter two. Included in the chapter are methods for learning to distinguish what stress is doing to us. In chapter five the reader is offered tools for fighting phobia. I found particularly interesting the section with respect to Isolation and what to do about it. This specific issue is one that many in our society face. The section presents good proposals for those who endure feelings of isolation. The sentiment that `isolation is within, not out there' is one many of those who are lonely may not like to accept. However, I have no doubt Dr. Rich has hit the nail on the head. Rich follows up with suggestions on how to combat those feelings of isolation.<br />I discovered Anger and Anxiety to be very readable. Writer Rich gives keen solutions for controlling phobias and dealing with emotions. Case examples serve to assist the reader in a non-threatening and effortlessly understood manner. Rich presents his Cognitive-Behavioral techniques in the clear uncomplicated language too often left out of self help books. Frequently psychological data is neither particularly helpful while couched either as dull as dust or in too technical jargon for the ones most in need of self help information. <br />During my years as a teacher I was often the `sounding board' for those who were trying to change their lives. Along with suggesting the hurting think about meeting with a trained counselor; I always tried to offer titles for books I thought might serve as self help. Over the years I have read innumerable self help manuals and require that an exemplary self help work offer comprehensible definitions of problems, goals for dealing with them, and worthy practical methods for achieving those goals and suggestions for life after the book. I want all of that presented in the most understandable mode possible. I found Rich meets my criterion. I'm sorry this book has not been available until now.<br />Anger and Anxiety is an engaging, creative work in which Rich cites a great many examples taken from a wide variety of sources. This method serves to keep the reader reading. The reader learns how to improve their own tools for coping with the stings of life. The overall upbeat tone of the book can help to bolster the most discouraged. Life is an ongoing learning process, Rich presents some great suggestions for helping the reader make the most of the process. The stress relieving techniques presented in the book do work, and that is nice to discover.<br />Reviewed by: molly martin

Writer Waldman shows great talent for developing characters who are people you feel you know, then placing them in life settings we can all understand and believe. The struggle his Jack and Loni must battle is well crafted in this intriguing tale.

Once, not so long ago ~singers did not require smoke, fireworks, synchronized light and sound shows, floating chairs, and precision dancing to showcase their talent.All they required was a powerful voice and a magnetic presence ~those were the days of With Connie! Once, not so long ago, romance novels did not require excessive sex, violence or coarse language to showcase their merits. All they required was a solid plot, memorable characters and creative imagery ~those were the days of With Love!<BR>Perhaps that is why, With Love, With Connie works!<br />Henaut obviously writes of what he knows; the result is an engaging story peopled with characters who are believable, refreshing and sometimes unique. Robert and Rachel's longterm, long distance romance provides for a creative exploration of the traditional link between New England and the Maritime Provinces. There is an excellent portrayal of the elderly; the reclusive aunts (bouquet) and the manor guests. Trevor is a classic villain; I was surprised by the twist at the end of the novel.This novel does not need violence or sex to make it a worthwhile read! The unusual device of interweaving the effect of Connie Francis' music on their romance works well. The reader will not want this multi-layered `good read' to end.<br />December 12, 1997 is an extraordinary day in Robert Mascaux's life, involving him in a family funeral, his second wedding and a birthday party for a celebrity. <br />This romantic novel begins with a flashback to 1959, in Northumbria, a coastal community in Nova Scotia. Robert, a high school student, resides at the Manor, a private nursing home owned by his parents, Bertha and Camille, immigrants from Belgium. Robert's home life is enriched by his 'foster grandparents', the Manor residents. When Robert becomes a member of a Connie Francis fan club, he begins a lengthy correspondence with Rachel Turner, the club's teenage president, who lives on an estate in Flanders Cove, Connecticut, with her reclusive, artistic aunts, fondly called 'the bouquet'. <br />The reader discovers the enduring power of love through the struggles and triumphs that Robert and Rachel encounter during their friendship, spanning 38 years. The novel depicts the influence that singers can have on their fans and also reveals parallels that can exist between the lives of singers and their admirers. The music of Connie Francis is the thread of continuity for the couple for whom fate, an international border, family responsibilities, and a sinister villain delayed their marriage until December 12, 1997. <br />Like most good novels, this one has co-existing plots that compliment each other and become entwined. Perhaps the characters are one-sided, but they reflect a cross-section of all the people we hope will be a part of our own lives. We all have a Trevor to contend with. We all enjoy music and recognize its influence. We all have favourite entertainers. The use of Connie Francis recalls an age when life supposedly was more innocent. The novel captures life with its joys and sorrows, struggles and triumphs ~it's a delicious slice of life!<BR>\\"Who's Sorry Now?\\" Not the reader!<br />John Donatelli, Jr. a webmaster for a major Connie Francis website said of the novel:<br />\\"Even if you're not a fan of singer Connie Francis, this is a heartwarming, romantic story of the struggles and triumphs that only love can endure and conquer. <br />It also shows how the power of song, sung by a power of a voice can influence our lives. <br />Reading you won't want to put down until the very last word. And then pick it up and read again!\\"

Over time PeeJay begins to realize all is not quite as may seem at first glance, a box filled with her long absent father's belongings when his desk at the publishing house was emptied begins to unravel a little of the mystery.<br />Claudia McCants has produced a spellbinder in her Brave New Woman Mystery, DREAM TAPESTRY. The pain young PeeJay feels is palpable, her growing sense that something is not quite right draws the reader straight into the tale and continues on to the end of the book. Couple the quick pace used by William Manchee in his STAN BRASH series with the likeable group of actors found on the pages of Christine Spindler's Inspector Terry series for an idea of the excellent reading to be found in DREAM TAPESTRY.<br />Writer McCants has filled her pages with believable, well developed characters who might well be people you believe you may have met. DREAM TAPESTRY is a well written, deftly crafted tale sure to please the most discerning. <br />Reviewed by: molly martin
by Pam Stone<BR>Second Chair is the 3rd installment of Stan Turner Mystery series, the 1st was \\"Undaunted\\" and the 2nd was \\"Brash Endeavor.\\" Dallas Attorney Stan Turner and his wife Rebekah are having a Christmas party with family, friends, and clients as their guests. During the party the lights go out. As Stan gets the fuse changed and the lights come back on, he hears a scream. Stan rushes to where he heard the scream come from and sees his friend and CPA Bobby Wiggins lying in the flowerbed face up. The cause of death is massive coronary caused by the fall on the ice. Marleen Wiggins decides to sue Stan for 2 million dollars because of negligence in not sanding the sidewalk. This is only one of the cases that Stan is working on. Stan is asked to defend a young woman named Sarah Winters for killing her child, which she claims to remember nothing about. Before the trial even gets started, Stan and his family start getting threats through the mail, the letters are cut out of magazines so they can not be traced, the first one said: <br />\\"YE DEFENDERS OF THE DEVIL BEWARE! DEATH WILL BE YOUR ONLY REWARD. REPENT BEFORE YOU FACE ETERNAL DAMNATION. TIME IS SHORT UNTIL THE LIVING WILL AVENGE THE DEAD.\\" Signed DOOMSAYER. <br />After a court appearance, Stan's beautiful corvette has all of its tires slashed and windows broken out and a message scratched on his hood saying;<br />\\" YE SHALL NOT ESCAPE THE VENGEANCE OF THE LORD. -- DOOMSAYER.<br />Even after all of that, Stan decides to keep on defending Sarah because he believes in her innocence. After the trial starts, Stan is all most run down in the parking garage, his dog is also killed in their back yard, and his trial note book is stolen out of his office the night before a court appearance and he must recreate the note book in 8 hours before court reconvenes.<BR>Stan Turner is a very pleasant guy and the kind of lawyer that we would all love to have in our corner. All of the characters are believable and fit into theplot. William Manchee has done it again with \\"Second Chair.\\" I have not had the pleasure of reading the first two Stan Turner Mysteries, \\"Undaunted\\" and \\"Brash Endeavor \\" but you can bet that I will be adding them both to my private collection of books. I have had the honor of reading \\" Death Pact \\" to review, and I will say that it is the best book that I have ever read so far; \\"Second Chair\\" is a close second to \\"Death Pact.\\" William Manchee can spin a tale that totally keeps you holding on and wanting more. You can bet that I will read anything that this talented author puts out. <br />Kudos to William Manchee for a 5 star read again!
Isabella Ripa knows she is not to open the door to the boutique when Aunt Tallulah is not present. However the elegant woman at the door is so desperate Isabella does so anyway. Thus Isabella begins an adventure filled with murder, disappearance, conspiracy, machination and intrigue. Isabella and her older sister are wards of her aunt since her father's death and abandonment by her mother. Isabella and her two closest friends Vicki and Lauren set out to discover what has become of the Penningtons. The search leads them to almost becoming victims of a desperate con man who has already killed and is ready to murder again. <br />On the pages of The Night The Penningtons Vanished Writer Huesler proves her versatility. Her first book Buried in the Townhouse was a delightful mystery. The Night The Penningtons Vanished is a mystery, however this one is for the younger set. The Night The Penningtons Vanished is a well-crafted novel filled with delightful characters. Isabella is overweight, eats too much and like her friends is prone to jump to conclusions much like many fifteen-year-olds in our society. Vicki and Lauren prove perfect foils to Isabella's sleuthing. Carla the older sister is a self-centered girl, mad at the world, won't study, driving Aunt Tallulah up the wall. Again much as we find in many seventeen-year-olds. <br />Dialog between the characters is believable as the girls scrap among themselves, spar with Aunt Tallulah and pick scenarios out of the air to explain what is happening. Writer Heusler's affinity for description serves her well, the reader is drawn right into settings, we feel the cold, taste the bitter, see the frightening.<br />This is a book sure to please many mature middle school readers as well as the young adult set. Parents, teachers and home schoolers alike will find the book a valuable addition to their library.<br />Well done, happy to recommend.<br />Reviewed by: molly martin

From the opening lines the reader is transported back to the sights, scents and excitement of medieval times. A Whisper of Rosemary is a fascinating, fast paced work sure to keep the reader enthralled. <br />Writer Gleason's vibrant characters presented in A Whisper of Rosemary are well thought out personalities having their own identities and idiosyncrasies. Allegra's sorrow for being forced into a marriage she does not want is palpable. Maris the headstrong daughter of Lord Lareux is a youngster parents can understand. She has no desire to marry, however, her father determines that she will marry Victor D'Arcy. Unfortunately D'Arcy is a man who causes Maris nothing but icy fingers down her spine. Ruthless Bon de Savrille determines that if anyone marries the girl, it shall be he. Dirick of Derkland has no interest in marriage, he has returned home only to avenge the barbarous murder of his father. It is not long before the three young men find themselves caught up in a snarl entwining their fate with at of Maris.<br />The often peppery dialogue writer Gleason employs between the players flows in a natural manner on the pages of A Whisper of Rosemary. Gleason's writing is both powerful, and filled with enough detail to keep the reader's attention rapt. A Whisper of Rosemary is an exciting text which is sure to tickle the fancy of those who enjoy more than just a touch of romance interspersed with a downright fascinating mystery. <br />Writer Gleason has produced this narrative with the intention that all royalties will go to the Cystic Fibrosis Foundation in honor of her son. <br />Reviewed by Molly Martin

He learns to deal with his grief before Mama brings home the best pal of all. <br />This delightful book written by Christiane Renauld with illustrations by Corderoc'h is one sure to please children, parents, teachers and those who need a high interest limited vocabulary. Writer Renauld's A Pal For Martin is a good `read to' book for the 3-7 set, and is a read alone for strong readers of 8 and 9. Interest level will appeal for kids from 3-10 or so. While I have only recently been introduced to A Pal For Martin this is a book I would have been happy to use in my K-1 classroom. The tale is entertaining, sure to hold the interest of children and would be a nice addition to the classroom or home library. <br />Although first appearing in 1992 A Pal For Martin is one of those timeless works having continuing appeal for children today. It has been distributed to schools and libraries by Encyclopedia Britannica. The book is found listed on many school sites, as well as accelerated reading lists on the internet. I found the book available on the Amazon site for nearly [money amount].

Stacy Temple has been languishing in a near revirginiated state for almost a year without feeling the pinch (or should I say itch) to do something about it. Until bright and early Monday morning, that is, when a deli man's wink reddens her already pink cheeks, and has her literally running -- all right, tottering in kitten-heeled mules -- toward the nearest exit. Silly, to become so discomposed over a minor flirtation, if you could even call it that. Come to think of it, the unibrowed clerk's wink wasn't overly flirtatious at all. In fact, it was downright snide, even mocking, as if her dormant libido had emblazoned a flaming \\"V\\" on her forehead.<br />And that's when Stacy realizes exactly how long it's been since she euphemistically canoodled with a man: Nearly twelve, surprisingly frustration-free months. Venting her peak and burgeoning panic to her best friend, Charlie, has unexpected complications, however. Suddenly, her loveless love life is put in the spotlight, and a more unflattering view of it would be hard, err, difficult to come by. Standoffish, is she? Overwhelmed with work pressures, and too involved with the day-to-day workings of thongs.com to let the temptress inside of her free, huh? Well, we'll just see about that, Mr. Four Night Stand!<br />A week is plenty of time to ferret out a man to de-revirginate her, and renew her lapsing membership in the Naughty Girl club, Stacy optimistically hypothesizes. Why, New York is chalk full of swinging singles, over-sexed singles, pistons-at-the-ready singles: Finding a pillager of her unwanted virtue should be as easy as slipping into a pair of Manolo Blahnik sandals...but is love a requirement in order to find the perfect fit?<br />Valerie Frankel's The Accidental Virgin is clever, funny, and unselfconscious of its risqu√©, bare-it-all, down-and-dirty, tongue-in-cheek salaciousness. Perfectly tailored to the unabashed appetites of chick lit readers and devotees of \\"Sex and the City,\\" its unapologetic focus ison Stacy's sexcapades, and her fumbling attempts to get lucky, and thus, eradicate her revirginated status. Oh, readers will be pink of cheek, all right -- perhaps from apoplexy, shock or offended dismay. As humorous and witty as Ms. Frankel's prose is, you see, it's still discomfortingly graphic (in word, if not deed) and not quite what this reviewer would consciously choose to read.<br />Morality is given the bum's rush; promiscuity is glorified; and the virtues of abstinence are only fleetingly praised (and more often than not, ridiculed). Stacy's moment of epiphany is just too late, and too ambiguous, to save the plot from plummeting into the dark, murky waters of sensationalized, and over-exploited, gratification and cheaply gained thrills. And yes, chills, because Ms. Frankel's heroine is so very desperate to ditch her hand-me-down virgin's mantle, she'll set aside all morals and standards. Open-mindedness, and an ability to appreciate trendy, boundary-pushing fiction is therefore of paramount importance to a reader's enjoyment of The Accidental Virgin. It comes on strong, tweaks a reader's sensibilities, and expertly flirts with the fine lines of decency.<br />Reviewed by C.L. Jeffries
For every action, there is an equal and opposing reaction. Such scientific theorems are Jack Montgomery's weapons against illogic and theoretical impossibilities. Two years ago, his sister, Isis, and her djinni husband, Darius, revealed the existence of magic to him, however. As a biomedical engineer, Jack has obsessed over its existence ever since, distrusting its chaotic power, but has finally discovered a way to negate it. The chain around his neck is composed of titanium and copper wires. Theoretically, the computer chip it powers should stall magic at its source by disrupting its energy flow.<br />Deciding that a celebratory drink is in order, Jack leaves his lab and heads to a tavern around the corner, where a sultry beauty (whose innate sensuality is as thick in the air as French perfume) immediately catches his eye, and the interest of points further south. Looking away from her lushly curved body and kissable lips is harder than it should be. The pull of attraction is just too strong for Jack to accept without pondering its cause (beyond the obvious, that is) and its effects. Swirling sparkles of color warn him too late, however, that the woman is djinn -- a genie -- and has woven a seduction spell around him. As a dizzying vortex tries to summon him to Kaf, land of the djinni, Jack switches his talisman on, but is taken aback by the results.<br />Leila's ma'at -- her magic -- is gone, stolen by Isis's handsome brother, and by Solomon, he will return it! she vows furiously. Jack is quick to deny any foul intent, claiming to be neither wizard nor fiend. Although in Kaf, Leila and this powerful human are stranded in the Tower Lands, a remote and inhospitable place where dry wind and ash are a sore trial, indeed, to one as pampered as she. Hidden reserves of strength and determination are soon put to the test, for Leila and Jack have a fair distance to travel on foot before parting ways.<br />Will the enchantment of Kaf lure a ma-at wary scientist into acceptance of so foreign a land and so foreign a love, or denial of its very existence?<br />Reading a novel by Kathleen Nance is akin to discovering a djinni in a bottle: Readers will feel the excitement, trepidation and wide-eyed wonderment of such a discovery to the very tips of their toes. Enchantment is a wildly imaginative and fantastical tale about the alchemical properties of love and science. Jack is very much a man of scientific principles, probabilities and theorems. Hence, he's the proverbial fish out of water in a land as changeable and unpredictable as Kaf. A childhood trauma has made him leery of such unpredictability, of chaos and disorder and a lack of control (whereas Leila has thrived on the very upheaval Jack is so averse to). Seduction has long since become a form of habit to her. Leila's ma'at has never been particularly strong -- to her everlasting sorrow and regret -- so she has cultivated what skills she can, where she can.<br />Elementally, Leila and Jack are fire and water, two competing forces that threaten to cancel each other out. Their relationship isn't as complex as it could be, however, and thank goodness for that! Potential misunderstandings are thought through and discussed before serious damage can be done to their relationship. In fact, a power hungry djinni is more of a threat to Leila and Jack than their diametrically opposed lifestyles. Internal conflicts are still a problem, of course, but Ms. Nance has the foresight to utilize such conflicts to further character development. Her descriptions of Kaf are nearly as engrossing, blending fantasy with futuristic elements and bringing the land of the djinn alive through uniquely diverse, exotic locales and secondary characters (including a pet rock; how very droll, hmm?).<br />Although its intensity may wax and wane, Enchantment is still a \\"whisk-you-away\\" romance that's whimsical, soothing and darkly passionate. Ms. Nance's prose is almost redolent of sandalwood, the muskiness of earthand the heated promise of an Arabian night. (Oh, to possess the awesome, magical possibilities of ma'at and to bend it to one's will so effortlessly!)...<br />Reviewed by C.L. Jeffries

This work is a result of copious research. Bullycide opens with the story of the first known bullycide, 1967, in the UK. All the anecdotes detailed in Bullycide are the result of research done in the UK and span time from 1967 to the present. The first child to die by his own intent, as a result of bullying by his fellows, was 11. The youngest the researchers found was 8. One overwhelming theme running throughout the book is that children by and large do not tell parents or others about their being abused. The few who did often found their story discounted by teachers, parents or both. By and large much of the abuse suffered by these youngsters was viewed by adults who were aware that a child was bruised, suffering and tormented as being only `boys will be boys.'<br />Excellent research. Well written work. So difficult to read the torment these children suffered. Bullycide is presented by writers Marr and Field in a straight forward, non theatrical manner. The facts of the cases speak for themselves. Books such as Bullycide are a must read. This book will help to enlighten readers to the terrible torment children who are bullied endure.<br />I am both a teacher and a parent. While it is difficult to imagine that anyone would simply ignore the amount of abuse detailed in Bullycide , I am aware that for many years in this country (USA) as well as in the UK children's hassle of other children was most often not seen as a true problem warranting dedication for eradication. Especially significant was Marr and Field's finding that bullies on the playground by and large grow into adults who continue bullying their family, co-workers, neighbors and others. <br />The research bore out that the intimidated generally go on to be adults who allow themselves to be bullied by their family, co-workers, neighbors and others. Excellent work, highly recommended for all teachers, parents and those who work with children on any level.<br />by Molly Martin
It is 1141 when Lord Bayard is surprised to find a drowning woman in a pond. Lea, who entered the pool in the twentieth century is just as surprised to realize Bayard is a knight, horse, sword, medieval dress and all. Thus begin the misguided adventures for modern Lea and medieval Bayard. She meets Richard of the lovely smile, Sara who causes her much jealousy, Logan who claims to be Bayard's father.<br />Captured by the lecherous Logan; Lea is held in a dark, dreary old farmhouse, guarded by thugs and determines to escape. Fearing that Bayard is dead Lea manages to kill Logan, escape the hovel where she has been held and make her way back to the pond where she entered this world. Returning to modern times and her former job as a secretary holds little appeal, however, without Bayard Lea figures life in this world is as bleak. A raging whirlpool is the conduit between the two worlds. Richard and Bayard leap into the water in an effort to rescue Lea. One of them returns to modern times, while the other two remain in an earlier day.<br />I like this type of `from here to there and back again tale'. <br />In Only In My Dreams Writer Empson has produced an estimable tale filled with dynamic characters, sure fire attention grabbing dialogue, setting and intrigue. The notion that we might be able to move from time to time, space to space is an intriguing one. Some writers are able to pull it off more convincingly than others. Writer Empson's Only In My Dreams is a dandy read.<br />Only In My Dreams is a pleasantly puzzling account at times filled with Lea and her modernistic slang, profanity and reasoning resonating off of Bayard and his medieval methodology, palaver and thinking. The premise might have proven difficult to carry off. Writer Empson pulls it all together with aplomb. Logan is a dastardly fellow, Lea a likeable gal who learns to make the most of situations and Bayard a hero of the old type. <br />All together the book is a fun, entertaining romp to be enjoyed on a lazy afternoon.<br />Reviewed by: molly martin
Quelling a disturbance between the feuding kingdoms of Mercia and Powys is no easy task when the blood lust is high. With his sword swinging in a deadly arc, Blaise ap Elisedd, prince of Powys, has joined the fury of battle, shedding the blood of many a Saxon cur before blessed reason can reassert itself, and halt his blade. God's teeth, but he should have dampened the villagers hostilities, and put an end to the bloodshed as his father bade him to do, instead of inciting a greater fury. Injured and quickly losing strength, Blaise stumbles badly, falls to his knees, and is overpowered by King Aethelbald of Mercia's men.<br />'Tis a fate worthy of a hotheaded fool, surely. Chained to Aethalbald's hearth like a lowly animal for the purpose of ransoming, he has time aplenty to regret his actions -- and to plot a likely escape. Ricole, the Mercian princess ministering to his wounds, could very well aid him in such an endeavor, but Blaise is yet unclear of the details. Her big, blue eyes are strikingly beautiful, and her blond hair is a perfect halo of ringlets. He really shouldn't be admiring the beauty of his enemy, however, or even acknowledging the heated flicker of attraction her comeliness inspires.<br />Betrothed to the King of Wessex, Ricole is desperate to foil her planned wedding a sennight hence. Persuading her father to cancel the proposed alliance is nigh impossible, as she has unwisely tipped her hand to Aethelbald, revealing her defiance and the utter contempt she feels for Cuthred of Wessex. So it's a happy quirk of fate to stumble upon her father's hostage while in the process of escaping. Blaise reluctantly agrees to escort Ricole to her sister in Caledonia if she'll agree not to raise the alarm. Any chance to escape from the clutches of Cuthred is better than no chance at all -- but is it foolhardy to trust her enemy to deliver on his promise?<br />Aye, Ricole admits, but what choice has she?<br />One Heart, One Way is a light and airy romantic adventure that will raise a reader's spirits with its gentle exploration of external pressures on a star-crossed love affair. Cornelia Amiri has an unembellished writing style and a simplistic approach to conflict development. Instead of focusing on Blaise and Ricole's inner turmoil, Ms. Amiri utilizes the conflict brewing between England and Wales to establish relationship parameters.<br />With their kingdoms at war, Ricole and Blaise are victims of prejudice, forced to maintain an emotional distance when their hearts are already engaged. Exactly when and how they fall in love is something of a mystery because there is little build-up towards it. Nonetheless, a sweet, sinuous chemistry adds believability and heartfelt sincerity to their quickly blossoming relationship. If Ms. Amiri's characterizations lack depth and dimension, at least they're honest and likeable and satisfy a reader's needs for peripheral plot development.<br />In other words, Blaise and Ricole are fully fleshed out characters from the very beginning, and require little padding or extrapolation to add weight to the storyline: a fairly cut and dried example of &quot;what you see is you what you get.&quot; The odd reference to modern day lingo in the narrative is a little off-putting, and the dialogue is simplistic at times, but overall Ms. Amiri has captured the essence of the era, and its majestic, mystical, ballad-worthy mystique quite nicely.<br />It's easy to become lost in Ms. Amiri's prose, and the subtle, understated grandeur of One Heart, One Way. Aching innocence and ancient knowledge underscore this story of a spoiled princess eager to carve her own destiny, and her duty-bound prince, torn between loyalty and love. If you're looking for a sweeping, involved epic, however, I recommend you look elsewhere, as Ms. Amiri's novel is on the fast track for a happy ending (which suited my mood perfectly). <br />Reviewed by C.L.

The Kaskir nomads have been beleaguered by other nomads, the imperial army along with anyone else who has happened to come along. Their villages have been exhausted, children kidnapped until they are now very nearly at the end of their rope. Ailana, wife of the Kaskir chief's son, is resolute in her determination to be reunited with her children once again. Turan Khan, Jersak nomad ruler, is every bit as determined in his pursuit to demolish D'nar first and the other nomad clans second.<br />City of Tears is an excellent piece of writing with a compelling story to tell. I enjoyed the book very much. This work by writer Balkan is an action packed thriller filled with historical content and the brutal actuality of a period we can only conjecture today. Writer Balkan composes a representation of the barbarous life accomplished by those existing in medieval Central Asia. Following the struggles of the Kaskir as they struggle to retain their identity in an atmosphere where that is all but impossible we catch a glimpse of a life heretofore hidden from our view. The story weaves the mystery of what has become of Jinji, Ailana's closest friend, through the narrative with a most appealing adroitness.<br />Characters presented by writer Balkan in City of Tears are well thought out, creditable and at times, down right frightening. The time interval presented in this book was one in which the delicate or halt had limited opportunity for survival. Balkan's work is peopled with fascinating characters who are robust, inflexible, puissant people facing arduous times at best.<br />Writer Balkan's regard for the time period portrayed in City of Tears combined with his solid erudition based on much research have produced a work of the highest standard. Highly recommended for everyone who enjoys a good mystery along with their historical fiction. <br />Reviewed by: molly martin
The Review:<BR>An opponent lies disguised far in the passionless deepness of space ready to obliterate Caledonian Chieftain Connal MacArran. MacArran must protect his world. In doing so he is propelled into an affiliation with Liandra Tavor a mentor with the League of Worlds. Connal is both fascinated and repulsed by the mythical libido the foreign enchantress is said to embody. The green haired Asarian dreamweaver has never experienced anything to match the feeling she realizes as she dreamshares with Connal on her crystal bed.<br />On the surface MacArran's task appears quite fundamental. He will avail himself of Liandra's exceptional powers to find a missing clansman Garris then flee from her as soon as his assignment is completed. As with most simple designs little goes according to plan. Liandra's life is threatened. Connal faces the fury of his clan when he takes her with him to his world. The planet, which refuses to confederate with the League of Worlds has been kept obscured to preclude foreign adulteration. Liandra is no more pleased to be with Connal than he appears to enjoy as her captor. Once Liandra realizes where she has been brought Connal decides she must never leave. MacArran's absolute intractability toward contact with other cultures and his intolerance against aliens clouds his reason. He continues to oppose Liandra and when she attempts to escape punishes her then warns others of his clan against her as an alien. At times he is a difficult person to understand. Liandra is from a race that is very aware of their own sensuality. They do ultimately join completely with one man forever. Liandra has never felt any real attraction to a man until she finds herself head to toe with MacArran during their mind dream in their attempt to find Connal's kinsman. The pair is attacked during the dream by alien creatures leaving Liandra unconscious and MacArran facing the notion that it is either take her with him or leave her there to die. He needs her abilities; he takes her with him. Neither wants to admit the growing affinity they feel for the other.<br />In Crystal Dreams writer Cooper presents an unconventional science fiction type romance filled with an abundance of engaging characters and situations. Nineteenth century Scot-English relationships are present in a well-designed universe. The two principal planets are well developed by writer Cooper. This is not the usual science fiction offering. The romance emerges against a convincing backdrop of dreadful evil and other world detail. As presented in Crystal Dreams Liandra is a supposable personality filled with enough angst to keep her engaging. MacArran and his hardheaded notions become a bit ennui after a time. Even with my Scottish ancestry there were moments that I found myself wanting to `smack him up aside the head' as he continues to oppose Liandra despite awareness that she is not `tainting' his world.<br />Crystal Dreams is a well written page turner which draws readers right into the account from the opening page and carries them on a roller coaster ride of agitation through the tale and on down to the final paragraph. A nice book for a lazy summer's reading in the hammock. Not for everyone. Those who enjoy romance and/or futuristic science fiction will enjoy the tale.<br />Reviewed by: molly martin
Greed for a greater fortune kept Gideon Harwood toiling beneath the hot Indian sun long after he should have set sail for England and been reunited with his siblings. Wealth is naught but an empty husk without a family to share it with, after all -- and such was Gideon's ultimate goal: to provide financial security for Bethany, Bliss and his brother Caleb. He has returned to England too late, however, to protect his family from poverty's greedy grasp, and the desperate decisions one must make when confronted by so hopeless a situation.<br />His sisters' innocence has been lost, and his brother has disappeared into the ether, leaving scant clues behind him. Gideon's guilt over this situation is nearly unbearable, and will drive him to make a deal with the devil, his honor be damned! Revisiting the village of his birth (in search of clues regarding Caleb's disappearance) is the catalyst for the black events to follow. Gideon unwittingly discovers an ugly secret about Lord Stanwell, you see, an influential peer of the realm who has weighty ties to the ton.<br />In exchange for Gideon's silence, his lordship is willing to provide the wealthy commoner with entr√©e into London society, and thus, respectability -- something Gideon dearly craves for his beautiful sister, Bethany, who has suffered so much. To perpetuate this lie, however, Gideon must marry Lord Stanwell's daughter, Lady Julia, a milk and water miss who sets his teeth on edge. His tolerance for her missish airs is almost negligible, but there is a banked spark of mischief in Julia's fine brandy eyes, and a kindness to her gaze that bodes well for the treatment of his younger siblings.<br />Heather Cullman's descriptive prose weaves a tangled web in this spirited historical romance, where lies, half-truths and misconceptions muddy an already muddled courtship, and put the hero and heroine on the defensive. Attraction is a mighty force, however: Scandal is a love story that gradually evolves out of a series ofawkward, messy and unfortunate misunderstandings that are only worsened by a lack of communication and the interference of well-meaning -- and yes, selfishly absorbed -- third parties. <br />Although they have much in common, Gideon and Julia are initially blind to these shared traits, preferring to nurse their individual feelings of frustration and helplessness. Love for one's family can motivate one to act in a wholly uncharacteristic way, and in essence, sacrifice one's own happiness and future well being. Unfortunately, snap judgments are all too easily formed from such touchy and regrettably irritable behavior. So instead of seeing the parallels in their situations for what they truly are, they see an enemy to vanquish, a marriage to endure, a martyrdom to embrace...And standing between Gideon, Julia and that all important moment of epiphany is a mountain of pride, and the rippling undercurrents of a scandalous secret. <br />Yes, their floundering relationship is shaky and tempestuous at times, but once reconciliatory steps are taken -- and the hero and heroine's blinders are removed -- readers' bones will melt into a limpid pool. But is this a case of too little, too late? Ms. Cullman's characterizations are aloof and splendidly arrogant by degrees, but such high and mighty mannerisms are naught but a smoke screen. Look beyond it and you'll find vibrant, likeable characters aching for love, acceptance, stability and the warmth of home and hearth. All frivolous frustrations aside, Scandal is a romance novel confident of its path, plot and meaning, and positively shimmers with a delicious self-awareness. <br />Reviewed by C.L. Jeffries
The course of Jesse Saunders' life changed in a single night: the night she came home to find her husband, Dave, lying in a pool of blood, the victim of a fatal stabbing. A year later, Dave's final words to her still haunt Jesse -- his blue-tinged lips pleading for her forgiveness, his cryptic comments followed by a warning that she's not alone in the house. Jesse has since moved on with her life, reverting to her maiden name of Brooks to dodge the notoriety of her husband's murder, but she's still living in a kind of limbo, constantly aware that Dave's killer has yet to be caught.<br />As a successful defense attorney, Jesse has dealt regularly with people guilty of such crimes and has even managed to set some of them free, sending them on their merry way in a salute to the justice system and all of its inherent ironies. Having transferred from a New York law firm to one in New Jersey, she has built up a solid reputation for professional excellence, in fact. Jesse never dreamed the man suspected of killing her husband would seek her representation, but Dr. Kyle Whitman has done exactly that, albeit unknowingly.<br />Although it would be unethical to represent Kyle in a court of law, and could even result in a mistrial, Detective Paul Rawlings has urged Jesse to play along with Dr. Whitman's wishes and agree to consult on his case. The evidence against Kyle is purely circumstantial, and the police are in need of evidentiary proof that will hold up beneath the court's careful scrutiny. Jesse reluctantly offers her services to the handsome doctor, hoping that she is doing the right thing by doing so, and begins to dig deeper into a case that's painfully personal. <br />Is Dr. Kyle Whitman guilty or innocent: a victim of sabotage or the perpetrator of a cunning crime? Jesse has only her instincts to guide her, and the escalating fatality rate to warn her that evidence can lie, and love can bloom in even the darkest garden.<br />Taut, tense and terrifically suspenseful,The Night She Came Home is Lori Derby Bingley's debut novel, and what a fabulous first impression she has made! Fooling readers about a killer's identity - and the motivations behind such a crime - can be an incredibly difficult task to master, but the ample twists and turns of Ms. Bingley's plot baffled and befuddled this reviewer as few novels of recent memory have done. Jesse and Kyle's relationship has a dubious beginning, it's true, as secrets and suspicions taint what they tentatively share and color their perceptions. There's also a faint whiff of implausibility to their quickly developing relationship: precisely where, when and how they fall in love is a mystery best left unsolved.<br />I recommend you focus instead on Ms. Bingley's clean, precise prose and the plot's mounting tensions, both sensual and anticipatory. Time is tick-ticking away, and with every new obstacle placed in Kyle and Jesse's path, a new challenge must be analyzed, thought through and overcome. Disappearing evidence, physical threats, and encounters in dark alleyways are sharp counterpoints to the embedded love story. Eventually, readers will learn that the past and present are tied together with a neatly intertwining bow, but not before Ms. Bingley leads readers on a merry chase. The Night She Came Home will have you reading into the wee hours of the morning, so plan your day accordingly, and indulge yourself with a fictional foray into the \\"danger zone\\" -- where love, greed and murder collide with calamitous results.<br />Reviewed by C.L.

Special Agent Roman Santangelo of the FBI has finally run his quarry to the ground. For eighteen years, he has carried the memory of RaeAnne Sommarby with him -- the girl he loved and then walked away from. Every breath, sigh and remembered touch has just added to his guilt, and to Roman's burning desire to earn RaeAnne's forgiveness, however improbable or ill deserved. Although he's regretted like hell letting go of her, his purpose for being in Cleary Hot Springs isn't to pursue a second chance with the woman of his heart: It's to bury the past with as few regrets as possible. Only then will this wild-haired, Harley-riding renegade leave the memory of RaeAnne -- and those sweet nights of passion -- behind him.<br />Oh, he's half-convinced of his own lies, all right...until Roman rides into RaeAnne's camp and discovers her tied to a tree and spitting mad as a rowdy group of teenagers despoil her dig site. Claiming the old bones she dug up are from an Indian burial ground, and as such, sacred, the boys take possession of several boxes of carefully excavated artifacts. Their intimidation tactics are put to a premature halt, however, with the arrival of a tall, intimidating stranger. Her gallant rescuer is none other than Roman Santangelo, childhood friend, lover, heartbreaker, and, oh yes: the reason RaeAnne pulled up roots eighteen years ago and started a new life elsewhere. With a new name and new dreams, some of which were quickly shattered.<br />Forgiveness is too much to ask of her, RaeAnne angrily insists, aching at the hurt, vulnerability and raw neediness in Roman's eyes. For heaven's sake, he didn't even say goodbye before disappearing from her life. Surely, any explanations offered now are eighteen years too late. A change of heart can happen in an instant, though, in a heartbeat of shared understanding, lingering grief, and the ghosts of lost opportunities. Compounding an already sticky situation is an impromptu FBI investigation, of which Roman takes botha personal and professional interest in, involving yet another grave site, possible poaching of endangered species, and a drug ring -- that may or may not be connected to Roman's father. A man whose secret sins put the lie to the position of honor he holds in the memories of the Paiute people.<br />Sins of the Father by Nina Bruhns is a fantastically absorbing novel of complexity, sensitivity and tremendous, attention-grabbing vitality. Fast-paced and cleverly plotted, with richly drawn characterizations and intensely emotional conflicts, it's a love story with more than a few twists and turns to it. Reuniting with a lost love is a risky proposition at best. Personally, I heartily regret the fact that RaeAnne and Roman's reunion is nearly two decades in the making. That's a lot of wasted time, after all. To Ms. Bruhns' credit, Roman has a valid reason for acting the way he did -- a reason that's valid, but not particularly forgivable in RaeAnne's eyes.<br />She has lost too much, suffered too much, to easily accept the choices Roman made as a young man. Choices that affected her own future as well. But against the odds, RaeAnne's heart begins to soften toward Roman, and a new understanding is formed between them. Forced proximity can work miracles, apparently, along with the intimate knowledge only lovers can share, wordlessly, effortlessly. Roman has suffered as well, you see, and has the ghost of his father's betrayal -- and his own shame --- to contend with. Although he walks a separate road, his honor demands that he make restitution for his father's actions, something to still the turmoil within him.<br />Ms. Bruhns' Native American hero is just about the sexiest hero I've encountered in a good, long while. Bone-deep honorable, Roman is a man caught between two worlds. Deliciously conflicted and sleekly sensual, his relationship with RaeAnne is the perfect counterbalance to even everything out. Quite simply, Sins of the Father is an exceptional read. It's exciting, evocative, quietly spiritual, and filled to the brim with every reader's bliss: sensual sparks, smarts and startling surprises. The plot is a mixed bag of individualizing details, making the storyline a multi-dimensional one with across-the-board appeal. Archaeology, Native American cultures, FBI agents...What's not to love, I ask you?<br />Reviewed by C.L. Jeffries

In the late 1970s, Dr. David Kudrik, a Russian Jew is being held captive in Arzamas-16, a secret USSR town that does not exist on any map. David is a genius and has gotten a hold of some 8080 microprocessors. With this new technology, he is able to create approximately 132 nuclear bombs for the KGB. These small suitcase-size three-kiloton nuclear bombs, which David named Samson, are secretly placed around the world at designated spots by Major Yevgeny Yarovitsin. When the USSR collapses, the bombs are forgotten about because the KGB never reported them being made. Now, in 1999, Yevgeny is living the high life while selling these bombs to the highest bidder. Recently he has sold ten of these bombs to Iranian terrorist who plan on detonating them on United States soil. Lou Feldman, Assistant Director in charge of Domestic Terrorism Unit, learns of these suitcase nuclear bombs and has agents trying to figure out how many bombs there and who has them. Begrudgingly, he assigns Harvey Randall, who is on his black list because he embarrassed the FBI a few years back, to help figure out whom the terrorists are. Harvey, an overweight, middle-aged cowboy does things his own way, no matter the consequences, because he gets results. Louis Edwards, CIA officer and head of the Blackest of the Black, brings Major Jim Harper back to duty to help track down and eliminate the terrorists. Jim, with the help of Sergeant Darby Hayes and Harvey Randall is hot on the trail of the man planting the bombs, Michael Rehazi, an American-educated Iranian who is know as The Terror of Tehran. Little does anyone know, but David intended to seek revenge for the way he was treated by the USSR government. He intends to strike back at the USSR by programming a secret way for all of the Samson devices to detonate. Little does anyone know that twenty years after each device is build, the internal clock will send a message to activate the device. Now, the bombs are on American soil and the clockis ticking<BR>Blood Covenant by Douglas de Bono is the second book to feature Jim Harper. This is a military thriller revolving around terrorism in the United States and the planting of ten suitcase nuclear bombs. The first book featuring Major Jim Harper is Point of Honor. This story takes place about two years later.<BR>This is the second book I have read by Douglas de Bono. De Bono has a talent for writing fiction that is incredibly realistic. While reading Blood Covenant, I could not tell how much of the story was reality or what was fiction. I believed it all! De Bono obviously knows a lot about guns and how the military works. This book does a great job of delving into the political games played by both the US and USSR governments, both in the past and present, while at the same time giving us a glimpse of how these same governments handle certain situations that would shock the populace of these same countries. Jim Harper is a wonderful character with human flaws. Is he the best killing machine the US government ever made? Quite possibly. But is he human? Yes, sometimes too much, which can be a detriment to his continued health. I would have liked to have seen more of him in this novel, but I was happy to learn more about FBI agent Harvey Randall, who I think is a great character. One thing I really liked about this book is the list if characters at the beginning of the novel. I constantly found myself referring back to this list as a read the story. Overall, Blood Covenant by Douglas de Bono is an excellent read and should not be missed by any fan of either thriller or military fiction. You will be left wondering just how much of this story is real and how much is fiction.<BR>I rated this book an 8¬Ω out of 10.

Reviewed by Jill Cozzi, <br />Recently I received a press release announcing a Malcolm McDowell retrospective at the Walter Reade Theatre.

But then, I'm not Betty Jo Tucker.<br />If I WERE Betty Jo Tucker, however, it wouldn't even be an issue, for she would just walk up, make her confession without batting an eye, and two hours later walk away with notes from a truly killer interview. That's just the way she is.<br />Tucker is arguably the most unique presence among the many film critics on the Web today. In a world dominated by snarky teenagers and twenty-something self-anointed cineastes, Betty Jo Tucker is a gleeful, unabashed movie-lover; not a film buff, but someone who loves the experience of filmgoing. At seventy-plus, she retains the same joy in moving pictures projected on a screen as she did that first time she walked into the \\"picture show\\" to see FRANKENSTEIN -- in its first run. A critic who came into the business late in life after raising two children, one divorce, one remarriage (to the same husband), and a distinguished academic career, she is an anomaly among Web critics in that she does NOT subscribe to the Alice Roosevelt credo of \\"If you can't say something nice, come sit by me.\\"<br />In her new book CONFESSIONS OF A MOVIE ADDICT (Hats Off Books), Tucker shares her infectious joy in the moviegoing experience with the rest of us. It is truly \\"a life story with everything but the movies edited out.\\" Written in a breezy tone, CONFESSIONS is truly a snark-free zone. Tucker, who has set herself up as the premier lobbyist for the Return of the Movie Musical has even managed to find the good in such crap-fests as the Britney Spears vehicle CROSSROADS. She doesn't love everything put on film, but you've got to love a critic who's eligible for Social Security but can still laugh her way through the likes of the surrealistically sophomoric CABIN BOY and who reacts to the ghastly THE PRINCESS DIARIES by remembering to call her granddaughters and tell them how terrific they are just as they are. <br />Where CONFESSIONS OF A MOVIE ADDICT falls short is in Tucker's underestimation of our interest in the journey of a woman through academia, homemaking, and into film criticism at an age when most of us have long since given up our dreams. This may be \\"a life story with everything but the movies edited out\\", but many of us would love to see what's left on the cutting-room floor.
Reviewed by: Stephanie Simpson-Woods And Bad Bob<BR>When I think of the word \\"fear\\" Richard Lee immediately comes to mind. In Blood of the Wolf, Richard doesn't hold anything back. It had all of the elements I personally look for in a horror novel: It was fast paced, graphic and the plot was terrifyingly gripping.<BR>Blood of the Wolf isn't your typical werewolf tale. You know the story about the man bitten by the monster and soon turning into one. Who hasn't? When I first started reading the book, it had that feel to it, but I was in for quite a surprise.<BR>The story revolves around a man by the name of James Dennett, a photographer trying to pave his way into the mainstream, only to receive a hand full of rejections. He finally gets his big break when he receives a letter from a photography magazine requiring his services.<BR>The job was simple enough: pick up the supplies he needed and head out to a beach near the caravan park in which he resided called Opera Sands. He would go at night to take photos of its evening landscape in hopes that his pictures would be chosen for the article. While he was shooting, his ears picked up the sound of innocent lovemaking in the darkness. As he took the pictures of the unknown couple, the muffled moans abruptly stopped and he found himself being attacked by some kind of deranged animal.<BR>He eventually wakes up in a hospital, his body covered with huge, bloody gashes, the kind of wounds only a large, clawed animal could create. During his stay, James is visited by a doctor by the name of Carol Stevens who wants to help him remember that freakish night so the police could find the attacker, but she doesn't like what he tells her, that the attacker wasn't a person at all, but a Lycanthrope, or what most people would refer to as, a werewolf.<BR>The twist that makes this story so unique is the fact that the werewolf isn't a werewolf, but his long, lost half brother, Alan Sheriff who is out for the ultimate revenge and at one time a patient of Dr. Stevens. He believes he is being righteous by killing the few people in James' life and waiting for that final moment when him and his brother are face to face so he can finish the blood trail he started. <BR>You are probably wondering if there are any werewolves in this book. The answer is within another twist the book has to offer. Their Father, Duncan McDennett is a werewolf from a line of lycanthropes, who has kept tabs on the entire situation. <BR>Blood of the Wolf is quite the tricky novel. You don't know what to expect while you're scanning the pages. The action in the book is finely detailed and the murders are extremely grotesque. The writer of fear, Richard Lee does an excellent job painting a vulgar picture of death and betrayal within the mind.<br />Usually novels that are heavy on character development are not my cup of tea. Blood Of The Wolf is an exception for some very good reasons. This novel takes place in a setting that I'd never been to and was illustrated for me extremely well. New Zealand is shown to the reader from the point of view that the ordinary person visiting there would see. Also, the violent scenes were choreographed very well and spaced wide enough apart so that suspense was created because all the cues were inserted just right to have me waiting for the next explosion to happen. Last but not least is the bad guy. He was a twisted soul who you really did want to see dead before the end of the book. <br />       Everything in Blood Of The Wolf was described meticulously. If I have one complaint it's just that sometimes too much analysis and description was given. It slowed the story a little. That said, the realistic descriptions of New Zealand made me feel like I'd been on holiday there. Of course I could do without the maniac after my blood part of the trip for my vacation. <br />       In Blood Of The Wolf what is most important is how the character of James Dennett is shown to us and what changes he goes throughduring the ordeal he survives. And what an ordeal it is. Dennett doesn't know it but he has a half brother that is tracking him and is killing everyone he cares about. Of course James Dennett is last on the list of his brother's victims. <br />       Blood Of The Wolf was an intense book. Alternately moody and introspective, this time we're shown the inner workings of the mind of a victim who decides to fight back. This novel has a complicated plot with more twists and turns than you'd expect in a book of this size. The suspense throughout Blood Of The Wolf was as thick as a London fog and the action scenes were realistically graphic. If you want a book that will hook you and keep you on edge then Blood Of The Wolf is a novel you shouldn't miss.

With trial and error, and educated guesses, he effects repair of the machine and is able to hear the sounds of 20th Century Earth.

Back in 1975, a dancer named Nefertiti (Doris Demarest-Nemeth) in Phoenix, Arizona began working on a &quot;how to belly dance&quot; book project. For unknown reasons, she did not complete the project. Decades later, her daughter decided to use the photos that had been taken for the book, add text, and finish the project. This book is the result.<BR>The format of this book is that of a simple &quot;how to&quot; manual for beginning belly dance. There are about 20 basic moves taught, a page on posture, a page about finger cymbals, and a few veil ideas. Some of the moves include hip bounce, half moon, hip thrust, hip shimmy, sit-kick front, sit-kick side, sit-kick back, lean-kick, single-leg shimmy, backward figure 8, shoulder thrust, shoulder shimmy, shoulder roll, pelvic tilt, belly roll, head slides, and snake arms. The veil work section talks about how to wrap it, how to remove it, and how to do a few simple moves. The floor work section talks about how to do a Turkish drop (which seemed a bit odd for what is otherwise a beginning-level book), the sway, the half wedge, and the full wedge. For each item taught, there is a picture of Nefertiti accompanied by several bullets with explanation and a few tips. In some places, diagrams accompany the photo to offer further clarification.<BR>Since the photos of Nefertiti were taken in 1975, the book definitely has a strong retro flavor to it.<BR>Although I think it would be difficult for someone to learn how to belly dance solely by using a book, it can be helpful to use a book when the explanation offered by your teacher or video on how to do a certain move isn't entirely clear. A book like this can offer another way of describing the same move, and help someone who is struggling see it in a different way. For belly dance teachers, this sort of &quot;how to dance&quot; book can also offer alternate ways to describe a move when teaching it.<BR> <BR>Its Good Points<BR>This book is well suited to readers who want something simple and not too intimidating to assist with their belly dance study. The photos and simple large-font text would probably be particularly appealing for younger readers, or for people who want to ease in gently with the basics, without digesting too much at one time.<BR>For the most part, I found that the descriptions of the moves worked well for me. The text was simple, and it was very easy to tie descriptions to the pictures. Many of the photos illustrating moves were augmented with arrows, lines, or diagrams to help show the direction of motion.<BR>I was charmed by the fact that Sherry honored her mother by completing a project that her mother had begun in 1975. It's a lovely tribute, especially since her mother passed away in 1999.<BR>The spiral binding conveniently lies open to the page of choice, which can be useful when studying a particular move.<BR>On her web site (see &quot;Where to Get It&quot; below), Sherry offers sample pages from the book under &quot;Online Lessons&quot;. This provides an opportunity to preview what the book looks like before buying it.<BR> <BR>On The Negative Side....<BR>With only 40 pages and a large typeface, the book is fairly short. It might have been nice to have either an index or a table of contents identifying page numbers for each move.<BR>The plastic spiral binding is a bit of a nuisance when the book sits on the bookshelf, because it takes up more space than other kinds of bindings and it's impossible to tell by looking at the spine which book it is when it's sitting next to other spiral-bound books.<BR>There were a number of typing and grammatical errors. For example, on page 8 is says, &quot;This is knowing as Parallel Position&quot;, when it should have said, &quot;This is known...&quot; It would have been helpful if Ankestamen had asked someone to help proofread it.<BR> <BR>In Conclusion<BR>It's hard to learn how to dance from printed text. However, if you have access to either a teacher or a video that demonstrates what the move looks like in motion, the written text in a &quot;how to dance&quot; book like this can help clear up confusion. Sometimes, it's helpful for either a teacher or a student to have more than one explanation on how to do a move, and this type of how-to book can help with that.

This book is very well written, easy to understand. It is a real threat to Christianity because it is factual, well researched<BR>and written so that even a 12 year-old child can understand it and make sense of it.<BR>I have read many books written by atheists and against Christianity, and this is one of the VERY BEST!<BR>In this book Mr. Tulbure covers every single subject and claim of Christianity and exposes every contradiction found in the Christian Bible. I highly recommend this book to every human being!
...P>Christianity Exposed is a book full of awsome, objective and solid arguments. I did not want to post this, but when I saw the rants and out right LIES posted by \\"Reviewer: A reader from Monticello, New York\\" my blood started boiling.<br />It is so ironic how lying and dishonesty has become the norm today, especially by those who claim to be christians. In fact, on christianbbs.com' forum the good christians have decided to band together and post negative reviews on atheist; pages on Amazon. Go and see for yourself.<br />This book IS a must read and in the long run it will prove to be the greatest threat to Christianity ever.
I loved this book and The Illuminati Manifesto!<br />Very powerful works!
This book is a MUST READ people!<BR>I loved it!<br />At first I was a skeptic, so I looked up the verses and his claims, and sure enough, this book is right on the money. Ver accurate and an eye opener.
A must read, pure and simple!
To see more objective reviews also visit ChristianityExposed.Com and AuthorsDen.Com<BR>I don't think christians will be honest enough to post an objective review on here, as this book of mine is simply unrefutable.<br />Several Christian scholars have promised to refute it and debate me on TV, Radio and other public forums. None of them kep their word and once you read this book you will know why.
This book is a Catholic fabrication, in that it exagerates and invents many lies about our Order.<br />The Illuminati Manifesto which will be published sometimes in 2001/2002 will shed light on our history and our nature. For the time being visit our official website at OneWorldOrder.Org for more information about us.<br />Sincerely--- Dr. Solomon Tulbure--- Grandmaster--- The Illuminati Order---23
