I am a children's reading specialist and author (Teaching Kids To Read for Dummies).  I use these short chapter books with kids who have mastered three or four sentences per page type books and are ready for more.  When your child reads one book in the Bailey School Kids series you can be pretty sure she'll want to read the rest.
I'm a reading specialist and author (\\"Teaching Kids To Read for Dummies\\").  If your child has mastered first books, like Bob Books and Dr Seuss, get onto this wonderful series.  The short stories are perfect for budding readers who can't yet plunge into early series like Nate The Great but still want to read fun stuff.  -Included  are lists of new words and great tips for helping your child sound out.
I'm a reading specialist and author (\\"Teaching Kids To Read for Dummies\\") and I use these great little reading books all the time.  Just as the publisher's review says, they're phonetically controlled and have cute illustrations that kids can color.  I especially like the illustrations because they're not as babyish as some, which means that if your child is starting to read later than his classmates he won't feel embarrassed by too-young looking pages.  One more plus for these books -each one gives you a list of the sight words you'll come across in the story so you can run your child through them in advance.

The illustrations are a great plus for me because they're cartoonish and so appeal even to kids who are starting to read later than classmates.

I'm a reading specialist and author (\\"Teaching Kids To Read for Dummies\\").  If your child is beyond beginners books like Bob Books and Dr Seuss but isn't ready for chapter books like Bailey School Kids, here's the perfect  bridging series.  I have the whole Solo series and use it with nearly every child I teach.  The stories are great, the books have short chapters so kids can feel proud to be on chapters, the illustrations are lovely.  Solo Books have won awards, and deservedly so.

I'm a reading specialist and author (\\"Teaching Kids To Read for Dummies\\") and I use these great little reading books all the time. I'm writing this review because I noticed that some of Barbara Makar's books are going out of print and that's a great shame because these books are SO useful. - As the publisher's review says, they're phonetically controlled and have cute illustrations that kids can color.

I'm a children's reading specialist and author (\\"Teaching Kids To Read for Dummies\\").  I've reviewed dozens of workbooks but use only a handful of the best.   Nancy Hall's workbooks are among my favorites because they make absolute good sense.  I could go into a lot of technical hoopla about  the systematic and progressive teaching of \\"phonemic awareness\\", but really, this is what it boils down to: Nancy Hall knows her stuff and presents it in an easy to follow, attractive way with plenty of repetition and reinforcement.  Great books.
I'm a children's reading specialist and author.  I love this book for all the reasons other reviewers give, and for one more.  -\\"Hop On Pop\\" teaches your child about \\"word families\\".  He sees that once he gets the hang of a reading chunk like \\"op\\" he can read whole families of words like \\"hop\\" and \\"pop\\" and, well I'm sure you get the picture.  On the inside covers Dr Seuss even lists several nice word families  so you can familiarize your child with them ahead of reading the pages.  Ta,da! -A great book to have your child read once he's comfortable with very beginning words like \\"an\\", \\"at\\" and \\"and\\". (Remember to explain that some words, like \\"they\\" and \\"was\\", don't sound out).
