Walk into any bookstore and you will find scores of travel guides about Mexico. This one, however, stands out in my mind as being one of the better ones. While many books of this type have photos in the front and back matter, the authors have strategically placed their own shots throughout the guide, thus breaking up the text and making it a much more interesting book to read.<br />They do a good job of covering the Yucatan Peninsula along with many favorite traveler hotspots like Cozumel and Cancun. Bruce and June Conord have visited this area many times and their intimate knowledge of places off the beaten path is shared for all to discover along with some interesting historical background of the Mayan culture.<br />All of the information about this region is covered in this book including local eateries, where to stay, jungle tours, historic towns and local customs. There is also a nice selection of local and regional maps.  <br />Whether you plan to visit the Mayan Riviera, Tulum, Playa Del Carmen or Belize, this is the only guide you will ever need and I highly recommend it.<BR>RON'S TRAVEL TRIPS (Ron Stem) - APRIL NEWSLETTER
Nestled in the heart of Europe, Switzerland is a feast for the eyes, with azure-blue lakes that shine brilliantly against the greenest slopes of the surrounding Alps. Its picturesque villages and chic towns are accessible via high-speed trains, which whisk travelers around at amazing speeds, though many opt to travel by longboat on some of the country's tranquil waterways. It is one of the world's most advanced industrialized nations, yet its towns and cities are incredibly clean. It also has the distinction of being one of the oldest democracies. Part-time Swiss resident Kimberly Rinker has lived and worked here for years. She tells of little-known attractions as well as major tourist draws and everything in-between. Color photos.
Ireland is steeped in history, tradition and culture, making it one of the most popular vacation destinations worldwide. Its story is told in centuries-old castles (some of which now welcome overnight guests); stone circles strategically placed to shine in the winter solstice moon; and, of course, in its pubs, where local residents gladly share a pint and a tale. Its cities are a treat to explore, with winding streets packed with tiny antique stores. Trips along the coast take you to traditional fishing villages and past some of the world's best golf courses. This book, written by an Ireland native, tells it all. Color photos.
This unique region provides more geographic, biological and recreational diversity than any other country in Latin America. It has Darwin's Galapagos islands, misty cloud forests, the snow-capped Andes and the Amazon Basin. The natural attractions are unparalleled. This book is the ultimate resource for travelers. With an eye toward ecotourism, it's packed with practical travel tips and full of details about the region's unique cultures. Maps, color photos, index.

Return to a time when life was simpler. Discover classic river towns, mountain retreats and coastal fishing villages, small towns where you can still shop on Main Street, where the hardware store and the bookstore are not part of a national chain, old buildings are restored and historic places are preserved. The Burnhams, also co-authors of The Virginia Handbook, have discovered and explored scores of these delightful towns. Destinations include Onancock, on Virginia's Eastern Shore; Irvington, a hip town built around The Tides resort; Strasburg and Front Royal, towns rich in Shenandoah Valley history; as well as coastal towns such as St. Michael's, Crisfield and St. Mary's. The places featured in this book have charming inns and B&amp;Bs, in addition to good, locally owned restaurants. There are enough attractions to satisfy any traveler, but there is also space and time to tarry, to sit in a park or on a shaded bench and watch life pass by.

This guide is immediate and thorough; it give a host of places and activities that could fulfill even the most bored tourist's desires. The book is salted with the kind of personal experience that makes visiting these islands so special. They take us away from palm beaches, island vistas and rugged emerald mountains and put us in touch with the people who inhabit these beautiful places. From fishermen in Barrouallie to Rastas in the Port Elizabeth market and a botanist in St. George's, we get a sense of the lives that entwine to make up the fabric of these islands. Also, each section begins with a history of the place at hand, so important to understanding the southern Windwards. The authors have produced a journeyman labor, a product of discernment and enterprise tempered with warmth and humor. Those of us who have seen the southern Windwards as a special place for so long have reason to be thankful and relieved.<BR>Paul Tyler, Caribbean Compass
As in previous guides by this author,  information is arranged according to specific areas of the Catskills.  Highlights of Sullivan, Ulster, Greene, and Delaware counties are listed systematically in helpful fashion.  Anything travelers or tourists could possibly want or need to know about the Catskills has been researched by the author.  In a style that feels like reminiscing with an old friend, Ms. Silverman shares insights on food, lodging, and points of interest both past and present.  And if her directions don't help travelers find their way through rustic country on mountain roads, the author states law officers and locals are friendly and helpful to lost tourists.<BR> <BR>Catskills history is fascinating.  In addition to step by step guides for each county, readers will discover charming stories about famous visitors - a who's who of the past.<BR> <BR>The Catskills and Hudson River Valley come alive, thanks to Francine Silverman's skill.  With fresh air, clean water, and pristine forests, it would make a most appealing destination.<BR>As was her previous guide book, Long Island Alive, this latest book is a must have for anyone planning a visit to the Catskills.<BR> <BR>Laurel Johnson<BR>Midwest Book Review
Silverman, a veteran feature writer for newspapers and magazines, is an expert when it comes to providing the reader with the most up-to-date details pertaining to the Catskills. <br />The guidebook more than adequately dispels the often- heard misconception \\"there's nothing to do in the Catskills anymore.\\"<br />Admirably fulfilling its objective of providing a comprehensive guide to the Catskills, Silverman pinpoints locations by dividing them into four areas- Sullivan, Ulster, Greene and Delaware.<BR>Within these areas, the guidebook provides the reader with comprehensive listing and descriptions of places to stay, eat, and shop, attractions, museums, festivals, events, and other \\"goodies.\\"<br />In a way, the book serves as an invitation for people to come and enjoy this beautiful area of New York State.<br />The introduction to the book sets the stage for the chapters that follow, giving a brief overview and explanation of the environment, forests, wildlife, contemporary Catskills, gambling, nightlife, getting around, driving, transportation services, where to stay and eat, shopping, seasonal considerations, guided trips, and brochures and publications.<br />Each of the chapters that follow describe in detail all of the above, and in addition provide some interesting tips, and \\"did you know facts.\\" <br />As an example, Silverman informs us, Ostriches lack teeth but can painfully clamp down on your hand. Children should be warned to look and not touch. <br />The Kaaterskill Falls &amp; Catskill Mountain House's guest list is a biographer's dream: <BR>Alexander Graham Bell, Henry James, Oscar Wilde, Ulysses S. Grant, Mark Twain, Winslow Home and Tyronne Power.<BR>Most of all, it was Thomas Cole, leader of the Hudson River School of Landscape painters, who popularized the region with his Catskill Mountain House and other paintings.<br />The book is also peppered with many other tidbits concerning the history of the hotels and bygone days, the Algonquin influence, community improvements, and works in progress that represent significant projects that may or may not materialize.<br />No doubt, this guidebook will be of immense aid to those who are contemplating a visit to the Catskills or perhaps those who vacation in the area but were not aware of its many attractions.<br />Silverman's profound knowledge gives the book a substance well beyond many Catskills' guidebooks.
Belize holds three of the four coral atolls in the Caribbean, hosts the world's only jaguar reserve, and has the highest waterfall in Central America. The author's updated book is a tour guide helping the adventure-oriented traveler take advantage of these rare visions as she tells how to make the most of Belize, from locating a local tour to visiting backroads and less traveled areas of the country. A must for any traveler who wants to experience the outdoors of the country.<BR>Library Bookwatch
A couple of happy wanderers, Tim and Barbara Rogers, have a stack of travel books to their credit as high as a totem pole. As co-authors and on their own, they have covered such widespread locales as their New England homestead, the Galapagos Islands, African safari parks, Latin America and the rivers and seas of Europe.<br />Here, the peripatetic pair is back on the familiar turf of the first days of their marriage, when they explored the provinces on their honeymoon. \\"We've traveled much of the world together,\\" writes the globetrotting duo in the book's introduction, \\"but no place on earth (as Canada's Atlantic Provinces) has constantly offered...so many adventures to broaden our repertoire of outdoor activities.\\"<br />Meandering through New Brunswick, Nova Scotia, Prince Edward Island and Newfoundland, kayaking around an iceberg, running exhilarating rapids, or simply watching a family of moose grazing along a lazy river, the authors joyfully record the great natural beauty of this unspoiled land.<br />Jam-packed with useful information, the hefty volume (620 pages) has an easy-to-follow format with plenty of practical travel tips. Included are recommendations on where to stay and eat, plus detailed background on what to do and see, where and when. Whether you're looking for a cultural and eco-travel experience, wildlife-watching, fishing and camping sites, or merely a restful respite from a humdrum workaday world, the Rogers can guide you to a rewarding outdoors getaway.<br />Jack McGuire of Frequent Flyer magazine
We residents of Long Island will be tickled pink with the author's thorough research of Long Island's length and breadth, 100 miles long and 20 miles across at its widest point. It will also provide a sweeping view for the visitor to the island. Before it was named in 1614 by Dutch explorer Adrian Block, our island was home to Indians for thousands of years and Indian names from Amagansett \\"plenty of good water\\" to Wyandanch, the chief who befriended the white settlers, are still many across the island. <br />Silverman's exhaustive investigation of every aspect of Long Island gives the reader a complete picture of every area, covered and explained. From geographical details of its two counties, with Nassau and Suffolk's north and south shores, and latter's north and south forks, all readers' questions are answered, from its largest ethnic group (Italian Americans, 27 percent( to its highest point (Jayne's Hill in Melville at 400 feet above sea level). We are flat! <br />The author's 10 reasons to visit Long Island (and we should be proud) are 1) 23 state parks and more than 50 county parks; 2) superb restaurants; 3) scenic waterways, 4) gilded-age mansions open to the public; 5) world-class concert halls and arenas; 6) hundreds of miles of white sandy beaches; 7) more than 100 museums; 8) 7,000 structures built prior to the 20th century; 9) unique architecture and 10) animal refuges and preserves. Sounds like something for everyone. <br />From recreations of all sorts from biking and hiking, horseback riding and fishing to golf, tennis, boating and beaches (the 2,400-acre Jones Beach State Park and famous beach draws six to seven million visitors from around the world each summer). In this, the nation's fourth wealthiest area, residents support 1,196 shopping centers in addition to chain stores, boutiques and shops, found in virtually every town. Long Island is described as a microcosm of New York City, offering something for everyone, from restaurants and late night bars with live music, to celebrated concert halls featuring top names in entertainment, lounges, piano bars, comedy clubs and nightclubs. The book lists festivals, events, medical facilities, houses of worship, etc. in addition to accommodations and restaurants across the county, with price scales for each. <br />Under Nassau County's North Shore, the reader is afforded an interesting listing and description of specific \\"Mansions to Museums\\" - from the Falaise Castle to the Tee Ridder Miniature Museum. Detailed information is given as well for the county's South Shore, before venturing to the less-densely populated Suffolk County. <br />This lesser-known area of Long Island, its many historic sites from Stony Brook's Grist Mill to its wildlife preserves, its Film and TV Foundation and its many family-fun facilities, music, theatre and art offerings, spas, cruises, all sports, shopping, museums, accommodations, restaurants and more, are presented in detail by the author. From its South Shore's William Floyd 1724 famed Bayard Cutting Arboretum to its picturesque North Fork with its 25 wineries welcoming the public for visits and tasting and farm stands featuring fresh picked crops from the area's vast farmlands are many and popular with natives and tourists alike. <br />Its celebrated 32-mile Fire Island with its pencil-thin barrier beach, no more than a half mile wide from ocean to bay, with its 17 communities' 200 families year round are joined by thousands of visitors every summer. No road or cars here and it's reached by ferry. <br />\\"Let's not forget the island's famed Hamptons, which the author describes as \\"like nowhere else on the planet,\\" with celebrities underfoot on the streets, markets, restaurants and shops. Like Long Island's Gold Coast, excess wealth abounds, with real estate up to \\"$ million a pop.\\" All this plus award-winning beaches, museums, windmills, historic sites, water and land sports and lots of shopping, from surfboard to sand paintings anda wide choice of high-tone fashion; a shopper's paradise even for merely the \\"window-type.\\" Restaurants, theatre, dancing and live entertainment are available after dark. The road to the Hamptons is a traffic nightmare during summer weekends, with tourists vying for the view of \\"life among the super rich on America's Riviera.\\" <br />Easy-to-read maps accompany each area text, excellent advice for additional sources and a helpful index afford readers easy access to Long Island Alive!'s ample array of Long Island information, border-to-border, coast-to-coast...
Pros<BR>   In depth information about Long Island <BR>   Geographic arrangement of chapters is very helpful <BR>   Excellent descriptions of attractions  <BR> <BR>Cons   Maps are very small <BR> <BR>The Bottom Line - If you are traveling around Long Island, keep this book in the car.

It's in here too. Keep this chubby paperback in your car. You never know when it will come in handy. Dawn Rosenberg McKay -
&quot;We had a wonderful vacation using this guide book. Unlike another one that starts with &quot;F,&quot; the Alive! guide is not full of upfront stuff that nobody reads.<BR>It gets right to the point in telling what hotels have to offer, the best places to eat (it arranges them by cuisine and gives sample dishes) and devotes many<BR>pages to shopping - in the malls as well as downtown. We got some good bargains as a result.&quot; Reader, East Coast USA
&quot;Information nuggets... fill the pages of newest of the Alive Guide series. Authors Permenter &amp; Bigley know their stuff. The book is jam-packed with travel<BR>tips that include illustrated dive and snorkel sites, town and regional maps, happy hour beach bars and nightclub options....

&quot;This is simply the best guide for the independent traveler yet published.  The information is cogent, well organized and well presented - especially for anyone who wants to fly to Iceland, rent a car and just explore the country independently without a set itinerary.   The nine chapters divide the country into geographical sections organized around the &quot;Ring Road&quot; (the highway which encircles the country) and are packed with pertinent facts and interesting information. The choices are laid out knowledgably and interestingly. There are numerous maps showing auto routes, hiking trails and places of interest.  There are suggested walks and sidebars on Icelandic history and nature in each chapter plus a fact file in the back that tells you everything else you need to know.  The chapter on Reykjavk not only includes a multitude of things to do in the capital itself, but outlines suggested interesting day excursions one can make by car or bus with Reykjavk as home base... really great for the first time visitor unfamiliar with distances and the time it takes to travel them.  Another chapter focuses on traveling through the uninhabited highlands and includes detailed maps and notes on  auto routes, jeep routes, walking trails, mountain huts, camping areas and more.  Author Cathy Harlow, lives in Iceland, has trained there as a tour guide and since 1987 has shared her enthusiasm for the country with hundreds of visitors.  Perhaps that is why the Landmark Visitors Guide so beautifully intuits exactly what the independent traveler needs to know. This is a wonderful guidebook and long overdue.....
