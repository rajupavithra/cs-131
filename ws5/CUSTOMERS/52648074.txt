The Four Agreements, a Toltec Wisdom Book presents a strong foundation for living a life of your own choosing.  All four agreements are sound advice.  The third agreement &quot;don't make assumptions&quot; is a potent tool for living in the moment, whereby you leave your past judgments behind and experience life directly, moment to moment.  I especially found the fourth agreement &quot;don't take anything personally&quot; to be very freeing.  I started to pay attention to how much I was taking other people's words or ways of being personally without investigating where the words or actions were coming from.  I found I had more energy and incentive to be responsible for my own words and actions and not for those of others around me.<br />     Another book I highly suggest reading is called &quot;WORKING ON YOURSELF DOESN'T WORK&quot; by Ariel and Shya Kane. While The Four Agreements presents rules or guidelines for living your life, the Kanes present a way of being in your life.  Their approach is based on the premise that through listening and simple, non judgmental awareness, you can lead a meaningful and enriching life instantaneously.  And it works!  <br />     Both of these books are great sources for creating your own heavenly life here on earth.

I found myself moved to tears by the love, simplicity and honesty of this wonderful story.  Morrie's courage to face life and death head on was truly inspiring. The writing style of the author, Mitch Albom, gave me a sense of my being present to the life inspiring conversations between Morrie, the teacher and Mitch, his \\"student of life.\\"  Theirs is a classroom, where the teachings of life are simple and where one can learn to appreciate each moment.  <br />If you enjoyed \\"Tuesday's With Morrie,\\" I highly recommend reading Ariel &amp; Shya Kane's book called \\"Working On Yourself Doesn't Work.\\"  This book is a practical guide to finding and maintaining true satisfaction in your life, without \\"working\\" for it.
Through this book, Dr. Lee presents a guide to personal and group enlightenment that would lead to the revolutionary idea of having World Enlightenment.  A huge literary undertaking, achieved with clear explanations and personal life examples, Dr. Lee succeeds. Through martial arts Dr. Lee has taught millions of students worldwide to use the energy of \\"Ki\\" to connecting to one's True Self and Enlightenment. I found inspiration in Dr. Lee's writing that individuals have an inherent right to enlightenment in their lives.  Enlightened living not being a rare occurrence for a few people, but a worldwide happening. <br />In the spirit of Dr. Lee's suggestions that True Enlightenment is found in sharing one self, I highly recommend reading a very effective book on personal enlightenment called \\"WORKING ON YOURSELF DOESN'T WORK.\\"  This book written by Ariel &amp; Shya Kane also presents a clear path to discovering who you are and how to live a satisfying, happy and rich life.
Joan Lunden's book is very enjoyable.  I read it in one seating.  It is a collection of inspiring, humorous and life appreciating quotes from many different people including Joan Rivers to the Dali Lama.  I found a rekindled appreciation of how great life can be after reading this book. <br /> I highly recommend this book as well as these other great books:<br />Working On Yourself Doesn't Work written by Ariel &amp; Shya Kane<br />Life Strategies  written by Phil McGraw<br />Healing Society written by Dr. Seung-Heun Lee
Debbie Ford's book is a practical guide to reclaiming your life through helpful exercises, journal writing and self awareness.  Debbie writes of how denying aspects of yourself you see as negative you deny yourself a meaningful and authentic life.  While reading this book I had a repeating thought of &quot;You only live once, so make it as great as it can be.&quot;  Great book with some great insights. <br />Other Personal Transformation books that I highly recommend include: <br />Working On Yourself Doesn't Work by Ariel &amp; Shya Kane   <br />The Power Of Now by Eckhart Tolle<br />The Four Agreements by Miguel Ruiz
&quot;You've always been a survivor Duffy, and you survive well.&quot;  This is a quote from the author's Mom and it is so true for her daughter's amazing story.  This was one of the most inspiring books I have read.  The author, a 46 year old ER doctor who perseveres in the face of daunting challenges, shares her incredible story of survival.  I was impressed with the unflagging support the author receives from her family, fellow &quot;Polies&quot; at the research center in Antarctica and her doctor.<br />In her book, Jerri Nielsen brings herself back to the present when faced with longing for her home and family while stationed in Antarctica.  I was reminded of another inspiring book called &quot;Working On Yourself Doesn't Work&quot; by Ariel &amp; Shya Kane.  The Kane's book is a practical modern day guide for living in the moment.  All these authors write of how precious life is and of how each moment counts. As there are no guarantees in life.  I recommend reading both these books highly.
The 7 Habits of Highly Effective People' does a good job of tying together the seemingly diverse areas of human relationships, awareness, spirituality and business issues.  While the focus is mostly business and work-related, Covey touches on how to be more effective in every area of life from marriage to contract negotiations.  He brings a fresh perspective to improving our relationships with ourselves and everyone else in our lives.  One thing I especially liked was how he carefully explains that there are not necessarily specific steps or methods to building the Habits, but rather conveys the necessity of a change in underlying attitudes that is required for significant progress in our lives.  In this respect, the book reminds me of &quot;WORKING ON YOURSELF DOESN'T WORK&quot; by Ariel and Shya Kane (another excellent book on being more effective, as well as becoming more satisfied in all areas of one's life).  Both books do not try to fill you with new 'techniques', they instead describe new ways of looking at ourselves - which ultimately produces the lasting results we are seeking.  The contrast between popular 'self-help' jargon and the lessons described in this book are clear and enlightening.  The book feels like it was written by a spiritual disciple with an MBA, and rather than forsaking one approach for the other, there is a synergistic (Synergizing is habit 6) blend of perspectives.  I recommend this book highly to those who haven't had much exposure to teachings on awareness, as many of the examples are relevant to the real world and quite practical.  For those who have read a lot on self-improvement, 7 HABITS can add a new, more business-like dimension, and reading &quot;WORKING ON YOURSELF DOESN'T WORK&quot; will allow you to achieve a greater understanding of what fulfillment really feels like.
Your Happiness Is There For Good.  This is a powerful life altering book in the disguise of a humorous bitter sweet story of a Jewish woman from Queens.  I loved it! Linda tells of how she works with many people who you would think are happy because of all their wealth, power and material possessions, but that is not necessarily the case. Wealth, power and material possessions are great to have but having satisfaction, loving relationships and fun is even more rewarding.  I found her writing style to be easy to follow and not too philosophical where I could attain the self realization she writes of.  I feel I have gained a friendship through reading Linda's book, one which I look forward to visiting with from time to time.<br />I  liked where Linda writes &quot;Express all your feelings, sorrow and joy and everything in between.  Repressing them makes you numb.&quot;  To fight or to try and change them just doesn't work.  Another wonderful book that came to mind for me is called &quot;Working On Yourself Doesn't Work&quot; by Ariel and Shya Kane.  Linda and the Kanes both write of how simple non judgmental noticing of how you are will transform your life.  Where you live life directly as a true expression of yourself.<br />I also appreciated Linda's avocation of having lots of fun in your life.  I rented two of the movies mentioned in her book and like reading Linda's book I cried, laughed and thoroughly enjoyed myself.   I highly recommend buying and reading both &quot;Working On Yourself Doesn't Work&quot; by the Kanes and &quot;I'd Rather Laugh&quot; by Linda Richman.
