This garbage is not worth owning. The writer is borderline insane. His ideas are that boxing is the only way to fight, and his broken English is next to impossible to follow. The author or his representitives are online over on Yahoo and plague the clubs with SPAM and obnoxious posts even after being asked to stop repeatedly. The material that we have viewed is poorly made and the instruction is of very poor quality. You would be better off going to a third grade playground and learning to fight from the class bully. Do yourself a favor and do not waste your money on these books.

This is the biggest load of garbage I have ever seen.  This &quot;system&quot; is about as effective as fighting a forrest fire with gasoline.  The originator and his representitives are borderline insane.  They think that lousy boxing skills coupled with a poor understanding of martial arts is a good fighting system.  The broken English that they speak is hard to follow and leads to headaches and a general state of confussion.  I have spent 17 years deeply involved in the martial arts and this by far is the biggest fraud out there.  Dont waste your money.

Can you beleive this crap? These guys think that you can learn martial arts over video tape? Having spoken to these guys online I find them to be nearly incomprehensible. They claim to have mastery enough over 128 marital arts? Gee, most people take a lifetime to master one art. They further claim that they can teach you to blackbelt, online, in ONE YEAR! This is utter garbage. ONE YEAR for a black belt. Let me help you save a bundle of money. IF you want to BUY your blackbelt, they cost about 2.99$ through most martial arts suppliers. It should be criminal to claim to teach martial arts like this. Yes, you CAN learn a bit of martial arts from video and books, IF you have a solid foundation of martial arts instruction under your belt. You CAN NOT EARN a black belt in a year. You can not EARN a blackbelt online. It is ridicules to think you can learn adequate self-defense from a video or a book or online. The martial arts are a first hand experience. Dont waste your money on this video. If you are out there and thinking of learning the martial arts, go find a reputable instructor in your area and learn first hand. Pour the blood, sweat and tears into your art and let it grow in you. There are no shortcuts when you are talking about something that you may have to call on to save yours, or your loved one's lives. Do not BUY your belt, earn it.
