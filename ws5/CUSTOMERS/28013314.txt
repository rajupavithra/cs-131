We dont see into the mind of O, because she is a slave, and that adds to the idea that she is an object not a person.  If we did see into her mind it would take that aspect away, and she would not be doing somthing she enjoyed while being trained, she would be being tortured.  The book would go from being a novel about DS to being a novel about being beaten and maimed.  Its not sick, its beautiful, the typical Vanilla reader wont understand that though.  you have to have an open mind to read a book like this, if you dont then dont read it.  if your looking for kink and erotica dont read it, if you think that DS is sick then you probably know nothing about it, and you shouldn't read The Story of O.  in order to appreciate its beauty, you must appreciate the beauty of the lifestyle, if you dont know about that, or appreciate that, then you wont appreciate the book.  dont read the story of O for information about DS, do not read the book of Gor either, instead I suggest looking for a website about BDSM that writes about the love aspect of it and the Safe Sane Consensual rule.  The Story of O is not for those interested in the lifestyle but not yet accustomed to it, you have to understand what it is to be a sub to read this book.

The story of O is a work about DS, a lifestyle not usually portrayed correctly.  While the story can be a bit more brutal than some live it, it still is beautiful in the wholness of the underlying truthes within.  Most people would not understand the Story of O, some people come to read it for the wrong reasons, expecting erotica or pornography.  The book is a beautiful tale about a womans journey through submission.  I am a sub myself, and my Master told me to read it.  during my training I carried the book around with me, and it spoke to me.  its important to read this book as a metaphore, and to move past the violence.  to the typical \\"vanilla\\" reader, the book might seam harsh or violent, it might seem like an atrocity, that is why I say to look past it, look at it as a metaphore, look at it subjectivly, so that the characters blur away leaving only the vaguest lines of \\"Domme\\" and \\"sub\\" and the book will be much more informative.  as someone who lives the lifestyle depicted, quite happily and abuse-free I might add, I know the power of the book, it is known in the DS community as a classic and a must read.  however, I Think it should be read by all people, not just those involved in DS, its a beautiful book, and it is true on many many levels, a touching read for anyone.<BR>Please note, that the SM involved in the book is not nessiscarily part of DS, it is just how it was expressed in this novel

I see people saying they dont like the &quot;insider only&quot; aspect to this book, and I find that silly.  There are many books that would not be appreciated by everyone, sometimes some of the best.  If writers wrote everything so that everyone liked it, all stories would be alot of fluff and lose all meaning.  part of the beauty of the book is that its somthing you have to know about, somthing you have to have inside you, lived with, or lived yourself to TRUELY see its beauty.  So please do not judge O until you can understand O, and give it a chance if you will, or if you find the book is not for you, simply put it away and think of it as a failed reading investment, not as the kink and masochism of DS.  if you are interested in DS, try looking for reasonable resources, The Book of O isn't a good starting point.  Enjoy.
