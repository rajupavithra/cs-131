I have read lots of books about Angels and THE GREAT ENCYCLOPEDIA OF ANGELS is, by far, the most accurate and complete reference about angels in our world. Not only it answered all of my questions but also gave me much more information that I could ever have asked for.    I can tell you, there are lots of great works out there that compile information from different old sources but they are very confusing. Different sources says different things about the same angel, the same feat is assigned to different angels, one source points one angel as of light while other source points the same angel as fallen, etc. This encyclopedia clarifies those confusions and shed light on questions that were a mystery for ages.    The book has valuable in-depth information, available for the very first time. Also hundreds of angel names with complete profiles of most of them. Each profile has things such as:    -The clairvoyant physical description of the angel.  -Description on each angel feats and history (with clarifications of the centuries-old misinterpretations).  -The angel's date of birth and age (calculated according with our solar calendar).  -The different names the same angel was called by different cultures and in different periods.  -Correct hierarchic ranks.  -The hosts and number of legions of high-ranked angels.  -His/her patronage.  -Authentic descriptions and pictures of the angels family seal.  -Gorgeous portraits depicted from visions and apparitions.      All the elements mentioned above make this book unique, but the portraits deserve special consideration. They were portrayed by the author from clairvoyant visions and apparitions, so they contain the exact likeness of each angel. When I looked at each one of them and realized that I had in front of me the real image of an Angel, I was filled up with inspiration and enlightenment. If I ever see one of those Angels appear in front of me, I will be able to recognize him/her!    Up to this point, you will feel amazed, but there is a breathtaking surprise at the Appendix, waiting to be discovered: Samples of psychowritten scrolls with the Angel's own handwriting. That is very exciting!    This book brings so much Light and awareness, that, just to open it, will make you feel much closer and connected to Heaven, and I dare to affirm that it is not only a feeling but a reality.     I widely recommend it. It is a book that I already keep as one of my most precious treasures.

Uno de los mejores libros para darnos cuenta del gran poder y responsabilidad que tenemos sobre nuestra propia vida.
El primer libro del Dr. Weiss sigue siendo un gran libro para todos aquellos a quienes les inquieta el tema de la reencarnacin, as no crean en ella.
I bought the book atracted to know about alchimists. The book doesn't explain much them but it teachs you a valuable lesson about pursuing your goals. Excellent.
Las autoras ofrecen un mtodo simple y directo para que cualquier lector pueda contactar a su Angel de la Guarda. El libro es muy fcil de leer y es uno de esos libros que uno quiere tener en su biblioteca personal y usar como un libro de referencia. <br /> <br />Aconsejo practicar bastante, los resultados no se obtienen al primer o segundo intento generalmente. Su Angel de la Guarda est ah, junto a usted, amndolem protegiendole en todo momento, transmitiendole su inspiracin y deseando que usted le hable. <br /> <br />Recomiendo ampliamente este libro.
Excellent book for anyone seeking enlightment and evolution. Once you start reading it you don't want to stop until you finish it. Find a pleasant atmosphere and a confortable place to read it, you will be tranported to another dimension while you are reading it. <br />
For many people, this book is the beginning of their spiritual journey. We reincarnate here on Earth with a veil that doesn't let us remember what is on the other side. Dr. Weiss offers us in his first book a door to that other side, a door that he opened for his first time in this lifetime.
After reading \\"Many Lifes, Many Masters\\" and \\"Messages from the Master\\" many years ago, I use to think that Dr. Brian Weiss didn't have anymore to offer to my spiritual growth. But I was wrong. I widely recommend this book.
