As travel novels go, this was one of the worst I've read. The story line was predictable and boring with very little action to entertain the reader. After the first chapter I became bored with the constant inane dialogue from Johnny, the main character. I found Johnny a very irritating character, completely lacking in both culture and manners. Johnny spent most of his time forcing himself onto the local girls in the desperate hope that he could lure one into bed. The characters in general were unrealistic and readily divulged personal secrets to strangers. In reality it is very rare for anyone to tell a complete stranger such personal information. <br /> <br />I found many errors e.g. street names in Dutch cities given fallacious names and basic typos such as one discovered by the first reviewer i.e. \\"the music backend me\\". <br /> <br />I think that most readers will find this novel a terrible bore, therefore its better left on the shelf.
