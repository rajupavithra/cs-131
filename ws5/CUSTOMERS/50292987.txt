This book by Dale Carnegie is one of the classic books written on public speaking.  Anyone interested in public speaking should include this book in their library.  My book, &quot;10 Days to More Confident Public Speaking&quot; (Warner Books) would not have been written without the inspiration I received from Dale Carnegie's book years ago.
Lenny's book is probably one of the bext books written on this topic.   Lenny's clear writing style is like being in one of Lenny's seminars.  When you read this book, it is like Lenny is speaking to you during one of his seminars.  He makes it very easy to understand.   What a wonderful book.<br />I can only imagine what Lenny's seminars and workshops are like.  They must be outstanding!<br />This book is a MUST for everyone's library!
I have read several book on overcoming speaking anxiety and public speaking and have found this book to be one written from someone who walks their talk.  Someone who has has experience and knows where people are coming from.<br />This book along with the book, \\"10 Days to More Confident Public Speaking\\", written by Lenny Laskowski are the two best books I have found on this topic.<br />And just think, these two authors are both from Connecticut.
This book represents one of the classics works by Dale Carengie and should be in every speaker's library.  As a professional speaker my self, I had an opporuntity many years ago to take one of the popular Dale Carnegie courses and this book brings much of that information to you.<br />Lenny Laskowski, Author<BR>&quot;10 Days to More Confident Public Speaking&quot; (Warner Books)

As a professional speaker and author of several books on presentation skills and public speaking, I have always had a keen appreciation for the management of time.  In fact, I had the privilege of participating in one of Don Wetmore's three day programs about 10 years ago, and still use his strategies today in my own business.  My most recent book, 10 Days to More Confident Public Speaking (Warner Books, 2001) would not have been completed on time if I hadn't been well organized.  As an international professional speaker, I spend a lot of time traveling and I know from first hand experience that there is a correlation between good time management and career success.  Th opposite is true as well.  Failing to manage your time will limit your opportunities for success.<br /><br />Beyond career success, however, managing your time effectively permits you to do more of the things you want to do and enjoy a better quality of life every day-both at work and at home.  The K.I.S.S. Guide to Organizing Your Life guides you along the path to more effective time management, starting with the important step of balancing your life.  After all, good time management isn't based on doing the wrong things quicker-that just gets you nowhere faster.  Instead, this guide show you how to achieve better balance in every aspect of your life.<br /><br />Don has taken a complex topic and boiled it down to a simple step-by-step plan that can be readily implemented by all readers-and I like that.  There's enough complexity in your life already; the last thing you need is an even more complex and cumbersome system to manage it!  Luckily, Don has devised a easy-to-implement, 20-step action plan to organize your life.  In fact, if you follow one of Don'd steps each weekday for the next four weeks, you will be surprised by the enormous strides you'll make toward managing-and enjoying-tasks and responsibilities that may have once seemed overwhelming.<br /><br />The methods Don writes about, and uses every day, are not lofty theory, but, rather, practical, common sense tools and techniques that he has tested himself; If they work for him-and they can work for you, too.<br /><br />Lenny Laskowski, Author of National Best Selling Book:<br />\\"10 Days to More Confident Public Speaking\\"<br />President of LJL Seminars(tm)ty theory, but, rather, practical, common sense tools and techniques that he has tested himself; If they work for him-and they can work for you, too.

The nice thing about this book is that it is full of practical and proven techniques and fundamentals of communicantion and speaking. <br />I strongly recommend this book to everyone.
