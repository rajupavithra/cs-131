This book is a MUST HAVE for lovers of linguistics, semantics, words off of the beaten track and crossword puzzles! <br />38 Chapters zero in on everything from &quot;People's Names for Names&quot; to &quot;A Potpourri of Adjectives.&quot;<br />From Chapter 37<br />NONPAREIL - adj, n. As an adjective, 'nonpareil' means unequaled, peerless; as a noun, a paragon, a person with no equal: &lt;non-pareil in both beuty and wit.&gt;<br />HEURISTIC - adj Greek 'heuriskein' means to discover. In modern logic a heuristic tool is one that helps or may help in discovering a truth, even though itself incapable of proof or demonstration. For example, no one can speak with assurance about the qualities of the &quot;ideal man,&quot; but the concept as a heuristic device may lead to constructive thinking and even to empirical research. In education, the &quot;discovery method,&quot; in which a student learns by discovering things for hermself* is also sometimes described as heuristic.<br />*Hermself (contraction of: her/himself): In the age of politically correct language, several unisexual words are presented.
This is a &quot;must have&quot; book for your library if you like mystery and/or detective stories. Better than Sherlock Holmes! <br />I only wish that there was a &quot;Complete Mr. Moto&quot; on the market. That way I could be sure that I have every single Mr. Moto story in my library.
Good information about most conventional food.<br />I find it a bit difficult to find some items because they don't quite fit into the pigeonhole categories. <br />Great information for fast food items!

Do not buy this dictionary if you are not learning Arabic script!<br />If English is your primary language and you are a student of Arabic you will want to have the Al-Mawrid Modern English-Arabic dictionary as well as this one. Unfortunately, the introduction and preface in both dictionaries is written in Arabic<br />This dictionary is just what you need for translation FROM Arabic TO English. Arabic words are arranged alphabetically. <br />If you are translating FROM English TO Arabic you will need the other dictionary.
If you do not know Arabic script this dictionary will be useless to you. <br />It's one word definitions (English script to Arabic script and vice virsa) make it more of a vocabulary book than a dictionary. Very good for general meanings but it may be a bit difficult if you can not conjugate words. It offers no assistance with pronunciation.<br />VERY handy picture dictionary containing Arabic & English words -- categories: fish; flowers, fruits & seed; Islamic architecture; birds; butterflies & moths; cloud types; medicinal herbs; reptiles; vegetables and human anatomy.<br />It serves it's purpose and is not as overwhelming as a full blown dictionary.<br />A concise pocket vocabulary book - approx. 14 cm x 11 cm x 4 cm.
As a writer I find that this is a book without which my reference library would be incomplete. It may be a bit big for the standard desktop dictionary one uses to look up the spelling of a word. Then again, that is not the purpose of an unabridged dictionary. If one is building a reference library, the unabridged dictionary is just as necessary as a thesaurus.
As a writer I could not properly do my work without my Webster's. Granted, it is a bit big to use as a desktop dictionary for looking up the proper spelling of a word. Then again, that is not the purpose of an unabridged dictionary. If one is building a reference library the unabridged dictionary is just as necessary as a thesaurus.

All of Archer Mayor's books have a gripping story line. Although the stories are first class, the pictures drawn with words as the story unfolds are the best that I have ever encountered. The magnificent metaphors can create, in less than one sentence, images that may take other authors pages. Although each book is independent in and of itself, I enjoy reading the stories in sequence. There is a steady progression in character development and interpersonal relationships as we go from story to story. <br />If you are a mystery fan, I am sure that you will enjoy the entire series as much as I have. If you are a student taking a course in creative writing, I don't think that you will find a better word artist than Archer Mayor.

This book: &quot;Optics for Technology Students&quot; by: Robert O. Naess fills a void in the area of academic texts. <br />There are all sorts of optics textbooks for students in 4 year engineering programs but there has  been absolutely NOTHING for students in a two year technical program. Here  at last is a text that does not have calculus as a prerequisite. <br />It is  written in conversational format and does not have that air of talking down  to students that is found in so many textbooks. This book is not only a  good academic textbook, but it will also serve a function as a desk  reference for technologists working in optics.
