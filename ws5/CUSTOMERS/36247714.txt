For someone who only had a moderate interest in philosophy and ethics, this is a pretty good book to get. It includes works by various well-known philosophers (Plato, Aristotle, Augustine, Aquinas, Hume, Kant, Mill, Nietzsche, Rawls) and is arranged in order of when the particular philospher lived. <br /> <br />There are also essays from other authors reacting to the writing of the philosopher. For example, Plato's \\"The Republic\\" is presented, followed by an essay title \\"Plato's Republic and Feminism\\" by Julia Annas. It aids in looks at classical philosphic texts in a more critical manner.
Luce Irigaray brings up very strong and valid points for the equality of opportunity of women in the workforce, but many of her statements seem to be of an idealistic nature. It places the responsibility on the employer to accommodate the personal desires of the employee. It also seems to remove the personal responsibility from the female employee in regards to working toward more satisfying employment. The generalized statements the author makes about women place limitations on the kind of employment she thinks would be appropriate, that the women would enjoy, and that the women would be good at. It seems as though Irigaray is saying that keeping women off of the corporate ladder is okay and completely acceptable because a women would not be good at, nor would she enjoy that kind of work.
I really cannot recommend this book enough, it is a great guide for dating relationships. It seems that too often when you examine your romantic relationships, you meet a person and start dating. However, there isn't a firm foundation of friendship to build that relationship on. <br /> <br />This book actually gives you practical advice for building that friendship. I strongly recommend making three copies of the \\"Agreement for Genuine Friendship\\". One copy for the girl, one copy for the guy, and the pastor/spiritual advisor may with to keep one on file (if not, you can frame it or something). The Talley-Graph of how the two of you spend time together (alone, group, phone/internet) is another thing that I would suggest you make a copy of and use. <br /> <br />The authors also take into account the ocassional mess up and how you can deal with that (limiting time alone together). Also, you have to be able to have an open dialog. If you can't talk about it, just limiting the time isn't going to help. <br /> <br />Major biblical principles are clearly marked in the text, with the Scripture and where you can find it in the Bible. You don't have to flip someplace to see where the author is citing, nor do you have to flip though your Bible to see what verse the author is talking about, it's all right there. <br /> <br />I definitely think that this book is well worth the money you spend on it!
I bought this book because the title caught my eye and I thought that it would have practical information for guarding against lust. However, the books tells you that you should abandon anything sinful. Though I agree with this point, I think that it negates the human element. <br /> <br />I guess that I was looking for more practical advice from the standpoint of a Christian couple. This book only offers advice for someone who is completely single, not dating someone. <br /> <br />I agree with the author's view of casual dating. I think that the disposable attitude toward relationships is probably a factor in the divorce rate, even among those who go to church. <br /> <br />It wasn't until about page 100 that I started getting into things that would be useful in my life. <br /> <br />There are some good things in this book, most importantly, the forgiveness of God and His mercy. <br />-be honest with where you're at <br />-know your weakness <br /> <br />If you aren't familiar with \\"The Message\\" by Eugene Peterson, some of the Bible verses will not make much sense. The verses are not labeled within the text, so you have to flip to the end of the chapter if you wish to look them up. <br /> <br />I tried hard through out this book to gauge who the audience was. I wasn't sure. From the language used, I would guess that the author is gearing the book toward African Americans, but I wasn't sure of the age group. Some of the passages in the book are mature and others are juvenile. <br /> <br />The editoral errors in this book were almost overbearing. I felt like someone should really check out the grammatical errors, and the editor should definitely be fired.
I was looking for a Life Application Bible when I found this New Living Translation. Honestly, the first thing that caught my eye was the color. The price wasn't too bad, so I decided to pick it up. If I didn't like it, I could give it away. <br /> <br />I agree with other reviews that it is easy to read. I also felt that in some of the passages that I was comparing in Genesis, the text is a bit compromised. However, if you or someone you know has difficulty understanding other versions of the Bible, this is a great Bible to get. <br /> <br />I also found that it is really useful when doing a Bible study to present a variety of versions.
I wasn't planning on buying a KJV Bible, but I couldn't resist. I have the NIV, NKJV, NCV, NLT, and the Message. The cover of this Bible is pink, and that was the main reason for purchase. <br /> <br />The price was the second major factor in deciding to get the Bible or not. It wasn't expensive by any means, which is definitely a plus. <br /> <br />Reading through it, I think I like the layout of this Bible better than the NIV. However, in reading and comparing some passages, I find the NIV easier to understand. <br /> <br />I like to have a couple of different versions of the Bible available and open when I'm doing a Bible study. I think that presenting various versions can help to make the text more clear. <br /> <br />I highly recommend this Bible as a gift for yourself or a friend, though you may want to purchase it in a store because it comes in various colors. I have pink, and a guy might not like that. ;c)
A great annoyance that I had with the beginning of this book was the concept of \\"ministry dating\\", a Christian dating a non-Christian. Chapman points to 2 Corinthians 6:14 as a reason that marrying is not a good idea. He also said that there is a lack of commitment in a Christian/non-Christian relationship. Honestly, the whole thing could backfire and the \\"unsaved\\" may be very jaded toward religion if the relationship does not work out. Also, the Christian may be drawn into sin by the non-Christian, after all, sin loves company (see Genesis 3). <br /> <br />I still think that this book is worthy of a 4 star rating. There is a lot of practical advice with Biblical back-up. It has really caused me to re-think the role of a wife, but at the same time, it doesn't say that the wife is inferior to the husband, she is his partner, his teammate. <br /> <br />The sections of the book that I think I learned the most from where the chapters on sex and money. Both have been perverted by modern day society. Chapman gives practical and Biblical advice in this area. <br /> <br />The chapter dealing with in-laws was very eye-opening. I never really considered \\"Honor thy father and thy mother\\" when thinking about in-laws. However, it does make sense that if you are talking bad about your MIL, you may cause your husband to dishonor his mother. <br /> <br />\\"Who Will Clean the Commode?\\" - I didn't really give a lot of thought to the duties that each marriage partner would perform, whether it be cleaning the toilet, or paying the bills. I just thought that those things would work themselves out, and perhaps they might have. However, a much better solution would be to assign responsibilities before marriage so each partner knows what the other expects of them. <br /> <br />One of the great things about this book is that the \\"Growth Assignments\\" at the end of each chapter offer a section for the married and the unmarried. I thought this was very helpful. <br /> <br />The last chapter hada couple of annoying spelling errors (I am an editor, I pick up that kind of thing), but not so many that it makes the text difficult to read or understand.
I read this book thinking that it would have all of the answers for getting him back. In reading it, I realized that getting him back would be pointless. <br /> <br />He has to want to work things out. - It reminded me of Exodus with Moses and Pharoah. Pharoah's heart was hard and he would not let the people of Israel go. <br /> <br />Chapman states that just because something is God's will, He did give human beings free will, so they may decide to go against God's will. <br /> <br />I like how Chapman backs up his books with Scripture. Using the book as a guide, I was able to note some of the faults I'd made in the relationship, and some that I've made since. <br /> <br />I would like to seek reconciliation, but he as to want it to. In the end, he may decide that he would much rather part, and that is something that I'm going to have to accept. <br /> <br />Chapter 6 - Long Distance Love <br />This chapter takes 1 Corinthians 13:4-7 and breaks it down. Each section of this chapter is one of the characteristics of LOVE from Paul's letter the the people of Corinth. Seeing it broken down makes it much easier to digest. <br /> <br />Chapter 8 - How Do I Handle The Loneliness <br />Fellowship with others! <br /> <br />Chapter 10 - If Your Spouse Returns <br />I thought that this sounded a little idealist. Chapman said to call, but I tried email. Either way, he can choose to listen to the voicemail or deleted. With email, he can choose to read it or delete it. <br /> <br />Using the other information that Chapman gives in steps toward reconciliation, I strongly recommend seeing a pastor at your church or a Christian counselor. A non-Christian counselor will be of little benefit if you are working toward a Christ-centered relationship. <br /> <br />Chapter 11 - If You Spouse Demands Divorce <br />This chapter was difficult to read because I was going through the \\"what if\\" in my head. It's not what I want to think about, but I have to at least acknowledge that it is a possibility. <br /> <br />Chapter 12 - Facing the Future <br />Jesus said, \\"Give us this DAY our DAILY bread.\\" In Exodus, God only allowed the people to gather enough manna for one day. Plan your day. (In another book, \\"The Love Languages of God\\", he mentions a woman whose husband left her, but each morning she gives the day to God. She isn't crying over her husband, she's celebrating her life.) <br /> <br />Sometimes, you've done all you can do, and you just have to leave the rest up to God.
As a college journalism minor, I found a lot of information in this book. <br /> <br />When the author makes the case for using \\"said\\" to attribute quotes, it does make writing the quotes into the story much easier. However, I don't like using the same word over and over again, but that's a personal thing. I do like how it makes it easier to decide how to give credit for a quote though, less guess work on the part of the writer. <br /> <br />The \\"Mixed Metaphor\\" section of the book was great for evaluating my personal writing. <br /> <br />The examples in the book are pretty good articles. I really liked \\"Churubusco's All Round Nice Guy\\". I read the story and thought that it was a little reminiscent of Anna Quindlan's style of writing, especially in her piece \\"Homeless\\". <br /> <br />Had I not needed this book for my journalism class, I most likely would not have bought it. However, I think that it is a good resource for those who write.
I read the original \\"The Five Love Languages\\" and thought that it was really inspiring and something that I could definely apply to my life. <br /> <br />If you've already read \\"The Five Love Languages\\", you may feel like you are getting ripped off and that Chapman is just taking a concept that he has already established and applying it to other situations to make a buck. CONTINUE TO READ THE BOOK! <br /> <br />I read this book several months ago, and have given it little thought. Then I gave the book to a friend, because I think that it is something that even those who have been Christians for quite some time can take a look at. <br /> <br />I think that this book is a must-read for new Christians who may have lost the initial feeling they had about being saved. I've been a Christian since I was 8, but I recently decided to make being a Christian my way of life from here on out. I remember when I rededicated my life to Christ, it was great. Then, I walked out of the church, into the real depraved world. <br /> <br />What was really inspiring in this book is that no matter what you've done in life, you can ask God to forgive you, and He will. Though we may know that, sometimes, we need someone else to actually say it. <br /> <br />The examples for Scripture are awesome. When I was done with each chapter, I would go through the Bible and see how God, Jesus, the disciples, or God's people used \\"Words of Affirmation\\", \\"Physical Touch\\", \\"Quality Time\\", \\"Gifts\\" and \\"Acts of Service\\" to show their love for God or man. <br /> <br />One of the parts that was truly amazing to me was the chapter \\"When Love Seems Distance\\". It discusses why we sometimes feel that God doesn't love us. For one, it can be that we are straying from God. <br /> <br />My one complaint with this book is that all of the references to Scripture are as endnotes at the back of the book. In Chapman's other books, the Bible version that is references is in parentheses or the text of the verse is on the page. So, in order to know where in the Bible a verse was coming from, I had to flip to the back of the book.
When I started my French class, I had the textbook and the workbook. I decided that it would be good to get a French dictionary. This dictionary has been great. I have learned several new words that I won't have learned in class. Using the concepts for verb conjugation in class, I was able to apply what I had learned to the words I was looking up in the dictionary.<br /><br />The back of the dictionary has a section on French verbs. Since that has been my major weakness, I thought that it was a great resource for studying.
I thought that this dictionary was great for aiding in learning the Russian language. However, you can't rely on this dictionary alone to learn the language, it is meant to be a reference book. <br /> <br />For the cost of the book, it is a good value. I went elsewhere because I wanted the book right away and paid double the Amazon price (still not expensive, but I could have saved some money). <br /> <br />I would definitely take some time to work on learning the Cyrillic alphabet before diving into this dictionary head first. The pronouncation is going to be very difficult, so audio CDs or taking a class on Russian would definitely be a huge benefit.
First of all, I love Gary Chapman's books. I started with reading \\"The Five Love Languages\\", then I read \\"The Love Languages of God\\". <br /> <br />As a new Christian, there are things that I found very difficult to understand when people who explain to me their opinion of a Christ-centered relationship and what a mature Christian is.  I was so confused and felt disappointed and hopeless. <br /> <br />CHAPMAN'S book came to my rescue! <br /> <br />The chapter \\"Covenant Marriage\\" explained the concept of a Christ-centered relationship and actually gives you some pretty basic steps to build that foundation. <br /> <br />The chapter \\"Spiritual Intimacy\\" is probably the section of the book that meant the most to me.  It explained the concepts of spiritual growth and spiritual intimacy. <br />--Spiritual Growth illustrated to me that I was a mature Christian, and that mature Christians want to be more like Christ.  It's not that they've been going to church and reading the Bible for years.  It's in their willingness to be living sacrifices to God and to be more like Christ. <br />--Spiritual Intimacy also answered the question that I had, \\"How can a newly rededicated Christian be loving, convenant relationship with someone who has been a Christian for some time?\\"  According to Chapman, both partners don't have to be at the same level in their relationships with God; however, they have to be willing to share it with each other. <br /> <br />This book gave me a lot of hope for establishing a devinely blessed covenant relationship with the man God has chosen for me.
I was given this Bible for Christmas several years ago and still have it. It has been through Vacation Bible School, as well as moving, and being in a box for a long time. I recently found it. <br /> <br />The coolest thing about mine is that it was personalized with my first name on the front cover. <br /> <br />It's a great Bible for a youngster who wants a real Bible and not a Bible storybook.
When I was first looking for a Bible, I found SEVERAL! They come in different sizes, colors, with different features, not to mention (NIV, NKJV, NCV, etc.) <br /> <br />I was looking for a new Bible since my old one was an NCV (New Children's Version). <br /> <br />I like how the NIV is presented because how the text is written is less confusing. Compare a couple of passages from a King James Version Bible and an NIV, and you'll see what I mean. <br /> <br />However, some church's use different Bibles. The church I go to uses the NIV for Scripture, so I can follow along words for words. You may want to check with your church to see what Bible they are using. <br /> <br />Also, you may want to check them out and see which one you like best. I like the NIV because it is easier for me to understand. My sister prefers her NKJV. <br /> <br />If you aren't sure in the beginning, but want a Bible, get an inexpensive one. You can usually find them for $5 or less. If you decide that you want a different version or your church uses a different version, you didn't spend $30 on a Bible. <br /> <br />Have a great day!
This was the first Bible that I was ever given. The size is great because it's about 4 inches wide, 6 inches tall, and 1 inch deep. Another great feature is that it's hardcover, so it can take being in a bag on the church bus.
I have a large family (9 sisters, 1 brother, plus their kids, etc.), so this book wasn't very helpful. <br /> <br />Also, the tips for getting family members to help out with the cake and misc wedding stuff, DUH! The crafty members of my family are going to help me out to cut the cost. <br /> <br />This guide is not practical at all. Save your money and be creative with ways to cut costs for your wedding.
I'm really glad I picked up this book. First off, it is a book that you can easily read in a single sitting. The family photos just add to the book.<br />Ekaterina's writing is very personal. It made me want to continue reading the book. I was a little disappointed when I reached the end, not because there were parts of the book that I didn't like, but because I wanted the book to keep going. I wanted to read more.<br />She is such a strong woman and has an amazing family. One part of her life is a situation that I'm currently going through. Reading how she handled it and bettered herself is an inspiration to me.<br />Why doesn't the US celebrate International Women's Day?
I read this book because it claimed to help increase reading by 50%.  I thought that I was a strong reader.  I read about 230 words per minute.  Well, after reading this book, I read about 250 words per minute.  20 words wasn't worth it!
I'm a journalism minor and this book is a must-have. However, after looking though the book and using it several times, it would be great for anyone who does any kind of writing. It tells you how to spell works, how they should be capitalized, and other things like that.<br />For journalists: it helps put things into the format that your newspaper editor or broadcast producer wants.  It also keeps your stories in line with the AP's guidelines.  It is a great tool to have on your desk, just in case you aren't sure.  The entries are in alphabetical order, so what you're looking for will be easy to find.
I'm a college student and taking a class on editorial practices.  Our instructor gave us these books to use because the school bookstore didn't get the ones he wanted in.<br />Almost all of the text has some graphic explanation.  There wasn't a lot to read, which is great for a college student.  The graphic examples make it very clear what the author is trying to tell you.<br />Another great thing about this book is that it is very easy to understand.  All of the newspaper terms used have clear definitions, along with a diagram.  It is in the first chapter, and a photocopy makes a great cheat-sheet when you are working on a layout of your own.
I'm double majoring in Philosophy and Communication, so I thought that this was going to be a great book for my Computer Ethics class.  Our assignments consisted of writing responses to each chapter.  I was so bored only a few pages in that my responses focused on those pages and completely left out the rest of the chapter.<br />Having said that, if you don't read any other chapter, read &quot;Chapter 5: Privacy&quot;.  This chapter is great for debate and is VERY thought provoking.  I actually read all of this one.  There are so many services that people can go to, where they can access info about you.  Is that ethical?<br />The good and bad thing about ethics in general, is that there usually isn't a right or wrong answer.  This can also be a problem in that some people feel very strongly about an issue and refuse to even view it from another's perspective.
I am minoring in Public Relations and this was the required book for the class.  It is pretty straight forward and easy to understand.  The layout is great and has been easy to follow.<br />One thing that this book could really use are examples.  They only talk about PR plans and news releases, they don't show you what one looks like or how to get started.  For those who haven't seen a news release, writing one can been a challenge.  A PR plan is almost impossible without at least seeing an example first.<br />However, for just the basics this is a good book.
I'm a new violin player and this book has been extremely useful.  Not only does it cover the basics like care and maintainence, but it also has information about buying a violin.  This will be very useful when I upgrade from my student model.  I also learned at there are different kinds of strings, so when I broke one, I had a little bit of a clue about what to ask for at the music store.  This book has been a huge help to me and would be great info for any new violinist.
I'm just taking up the violin after playing the clarinet for 8 years.  Well, I'm not so good.  However, this book has been a big help with getting started on the violin.  I know my strings, now I can work on the bowing!  LOTS and LOTS of work on the bowing.  :c)
Someone recommended this book and I bought it.  I'm really glad that I did.  After reading this book, so many things just made sense.<br />I get sad when I don't get time spend with me.  My main love language is quality time.  I know that know and I can be specific in making requests for what I want and what makes me feel loved.<br />I like how the book has a religious base, but it isn't 'preachy'.  It was also easy to understand.  There are examples that clearly illustrate anything that may not make sense in the text.<br />Share this book!
I bought this book just so I would qualify for Super Saver Shipping.  When it arrived, I flipped through the pages.  The book is so cute and I love the pictures and drawings of the babies, they are adorable.<br />Oh, yeah, my God-son (9 months old) likes it, too.  :c)

When I read this book, I didn't know anything about the life of people with kidney problems.  Though \\"Why Me?\\" is fiction Deborah Kent does a great job describing Rachel's feelings and moods.<br />Rachel wakes up one morning and can hardly move.  She calls for her mother and is taken to the hospital.  There, she finds out she needs a kidney transplant.  Since she was adopted, she doesn't know any of her blood relatives.  She is put on a kidney transplant list and tries to find her birth mother, hoping she will donate a kidney.  When Rachel finally finds her, it is awkward because she isn't sure what to expect, or if this woman even wants to help her.<br />This book is 177 pages, and with the content, it is suited for the 11-14 year old age group.<br />\\"Rachel wakes up one morning to find her world has been smashed to smithereens...\\" comes from the back of the book, and some reviewer tried to pass that off as a review.  I believe that's called plagerism.
I was addicted to these books when I was younger and it wasn't until I was majoring in education in college that I figured out why.  They were interesting with bizarre plot twists that most 9-12 year olds don't think about and they were short (usually between 110-130 pages).  I could read the whole thing in a day.<br />My parents also didn't have a lot of heartache with buying me a new book because these are relatively inexpensive (in the neighborhood of 3-5 bucks each).<br />R.L. Stine's \\"Goosebumps\\" books aren't scary, just kind of creepy.  There aren't graphic descriptions of murder and mayhem.  Just some ghosts, werewolves, or potions.  The main character is alive in the end, and the final chapter resolves everything.<br />**Keep in mind, R.L. Stine has other books that aren't in the \\"Goosebumps\\" series that tend to be a little harsher when it comes to hauntings and plot.  They are written more for the 12-14 age group and are longer (around 150-200 pages).

After watching the pilot on televison, I saw this book a the grocery store.  I wasn't a big trek fan, but Kate Mulgrew's &quot;Girl Power&quot; attitude hooked me to Voyager.<br />I read this book in a few days.  There were a lot of details that I'd missed the first time I saw the show and lots of details that weren't even in the pilot.<br />I liked how it described in more detail how the crews attempt to mesh so they can use their combined resources to get home.<br />The 8 page photo insert would have been a lot better if it was in color, but it was a neat feature anyway.

After reading &quot;Catalog Copy That Sizzles&quot;, I had to read this book.  I found the chapter on creating and writing descriptions of be long and boring.<br />The rest of the book is a great resource when it comes to creating a catalog, but don't get one book and one author's opinion.  Get at least two or three books so you can form your own opinion on how to create your catalog and you can use the tips and techniques of a variety of authors.

I was addicted to these books when I was younger and it wasn't until I was majoring in education in college that I figured out why.  They were interesting with bizarre plot twists that most 9-12 year olds don't think about and they were short (usually between 110-130 pages).  I could read the whole thing in a day.<br />My parents also didn't have a lot of heartache with buying me a new book because these are relatively inexpensive (in the neighborhood of 3-5 bucks each).<br />R.L.

I read the first two &quot;Star Trek: Voyager&quot; books and scanned the book rack at the grocery store for the latest installment.  When this finally came out, I got it and hurried home to read it.<br />I only made it about 30 pages fo the book before I was bored out of my mind.  The plot was good, I wanted to know what happened to the planet.  However, the writing was mediocre and the progression of the plot dragged a lot.<br />If you find yourself having trouble getting though this book, move on to the next on, for me, that was book 4 &quot;Violations&quot;.

After reading this book, I found it to have some good ideas, but it was too specific.  I thought the author was just writing a book to promote his catalog because, unlike other catalog books, he used examples from HIS catalog.  While the page with the Highland attire was a good example, all of the pages from his catalog just became overkill.  It would have been much better had to also used examples from a variety of catalogs.

I had to read this book for work.  The author suggests reading one chapter a day, which is pretty much how I did it, with one exception.<br />I found the material to be much easier to digest when I read it only one chapter a day.  I wasn't bombarded with all of this new stuff that I had to remember and implement into my descriptions.<br />Having all of the pictures really helped because it illustrates the points that the author is trying to get across.<br />I suggest keeping the book close by when your brain just goes to mush and you can't think of the benefit of this gadget.  Reread Appendix A and try to answer the 20 questions in there.  It will help you come up with something.<br />If your description just doesn't make much sense or parts are out of order and you can't figure out why, reread Appendix B, it have all of the \\"rules\\" the author presented in the book with a brief explanation of each.

\\"My Hairiest Adventure\\" is about Larry who used a bottle of tanning lotion on his hands and hair starts to grow.  One of his friends disappears, then he sees a dog with eyes that are 2 different colors, just like his missing friends.  When he finally tells his parents, they explain that they couldn't have children, like many of the other people in the community, so their doctor developed a potion that he injected into dogs to turn them into kids.  Now, Larry's immune system is fighting the potion and he is going to turn back into a dog, like his friends.<br />I was addicted to these books when I was younger and it wasn't until I was majoring in education in college that I figured out why.

I bought &quot;Remember Everything You Read&quot; and &quot;The Evelyn Wood Seven-Day Speed Reading and Learning Program&quot;, thinking they were companion books.  I checked them out, they are the same word for word.<br />Get &quot;The Evelyn Wood Seven-Day Speed Reading and Learning Program&quot;.  It is the same price (a penny cheaper) and it hardcover, a much nicer book.<br />Unfortunately, after paying return postage and dealing with the hassel, it wouldn't be worth returning this book.  Guess my sister in middle school gets a new book.
Amazon as sells this book under the title &quot;Remember Everything You Read&quot;, it is the exact same book word for word.  This one is hardcover and the other is paperback.  From reading the description for the one about it being adapted from &quot;Remember Everything You Read&quot;, I thought I was getting two different books.<br />Unfortunately, returning it isn't worth the money.
I have to admit, when I for got this book, the only thing I knew about soccer was a little black &amp; white ball gets kicked into a net with people on the opposing team trying to take the ball away.<br />Now, I know a little bit more about soccer and a lot more about the U.S. Women's National Soccer team and their quest to will the 1999 Women's World Cup.<br />This book is filled with an &quot;If you can dream it, you can do it&quot; attitude.<br />Not only do you get to know some of Leah's background, making her a very credible source on the game of soccer, she also includes many of the steps she had to take to get from St. Petersburg to the big game.  She worked really hard, she didn't just wake up one day and say, &quot;I think I'll go to the World Cup game today.&quot;<br />The pictures are just awesome.  The pictures of the games are amazing. There are also pictures of individual players when Leah was interviewing them.<br />The interview section was pretty interesting. It had questions that probably never made it on ESPN.<br />A Family That Plays Together Stays Together: This book was really a family affair. Leah's father, Chris, did a lot of photography and editing. Her sister, Nicole, transcribed interviews. Her grandfather, Ed, provided some photos. Other family members assisted with designing and editing. Leah's mom and sister are featured in several pictures, and went to the championship game in Pasadena, California.<br />The pictures alone, make this book worth it!
I thought this book was a neat idea and decided to order it.  I'm really glad that I did.  Each of the 50 ways to pamper yourself is only a few (2-3) pages long, so you can read it in a few minutes.<br />My favorite is #50.  \\"Words of Wisdom\\"  It is full of little tips you can do for yourself.  \\"Trust yourself.\\" \\"Stop blaming yourself and others.\\" \\"Ask for hugs from those you love.\\"  It also has a list of 7 self-affirmations like \\"I can do anything I set my mind to.\\"<br />This book is just full of little tricks to perk you up after a bad day!
I received a great shock my first semester of college when I had to buy books.  The price of the paperback version was great.  It was the cheapest college textbook I've ever purchased. However, after using reading the Chapter 2, the pages started coming loose around page 20.  Pages 5 through 10 actually fell out of the book.  I've had to use super glue just to keep the book together. Cheap was a good thing, but the quality is incredibly poor.  I would rather pay a little more for a book that actually stays together.<br />John Shand really seems to like to listen to himself talk.  I'm usually more confused after reading it than before.  It's pretty good for an intro book, but it can confuse people.  Fortunately, I have a philosophy professor who is pretty good at explaining things in terms that we understand.
I used this book for a college intro to economics class.  It has a lot of information for someone who doesn't know a lot about economics and the economy...maybe too much.<br />I found myself pushing to get through chapters because they were boring and many of the diagrams were confusing.  Some of the concepts aren't very clear.<br />The CD that came with mine was a huge help.  I would print off the study guides before I read the chapter, so I would pay the most attention to those parts because those are the ones the author thought were important.<br />This book had a lot of econ math in it that I was unable to understand.  The CD didn't address that very well.  Consequently, those are the questions that I missed on the tests.
Though this book does lay out some good guidelines, they are impossible to follow for anyone who doesn't just sit at home all day.<br />My doctor also cautioned that drastically changing your diet can do more harm than good because it can mess up how your body is used to working.  Cut down on bad things (salt, sugar) and add more good things (proteins, veggies).
I found this book to have a lot of useful information, but it starts off very wordy. I read a little bit each night, instead of sitting down and trying to read large sections of the book.  I would get bored and forget what I'd read.<br />The Pregnancy Diet<BR>There is a recipe section, that if I had the time, may be of some use. However, making cream of tomato soup from scratch is time consuming and more expensive that buying the can and adding milk. All of the recipes in that section need to be made from scratch, even the French fries, not a practical suggestion for someone who has a job.<br />Part 2 - Nine Months &amp; Counting<BR>The Question &amp; Answer format was really helpful. Most of the questions give you about half a page of really useful information, with facts, but not overstating the answer to the question presented.<br />Part 3<BR>From postpartum to breastfeeding to Daddy, the section mixes the Q &amp; A format with the informational format from the 1st section of the book. This section is very useful for understand your postpartum 1-6 weeks and tips for breastfeeding holds. The &quot;Expectant Father&quot; section is in the Q &amp; A format, and may have some things that Mommy hasn't realized about Daddy. You're husband or partner may not read the whole book, but is 1 chapter really gonna hurt him?<br />Part 4 - Special Concerns<BR>This was something that had never even crossed my mind until I read this book. From common colds to measles, as well as how to deal with symptoms of illness. &quot;I have a fever, should I take aspirin?&quot; and a bunch of other questions like that. It is an informative section that some may not even think about when they are expecting.<br />Pregnancy Notes section<BR>I think that this is a very creative section because you have 2 pages to write down your personal notes for each month. The book also suggests that you show the notes to your doctor, so they know what's going on, since they can't be with you 24/7.
&quot;Mixed Blessings&quot; follows couples who marry and face the question of whether they want to have children or not and how they overcome their infertility.<br />I really began to resent, and almost hate, Barbi.  I thought that maybe Charlie hadn't really thought about the marriage completely before he married her, or perhaps he was hoping that she would settle down and change her mind.<br />However, I questioned why Pilar would want to have a child with Brad, considering that he is already 60.  By the time the child graduates from high school, he would be pushing 80.<br />I think a lot of people will be able to relate to this book, considering 1 in 5 people will have difficulty conceiving.  And I think that people can also relate to the characters on the basis of &quot;What do I really want in life?&quot;
&quot;Daddy&quot; is about Oliver Watson who thinks he has everything.  He has a great life with the quentissential American Dream: wife, kids, house, dog.  That is, until his wife Sarah decides that she wants to go back to school...away from him and the kids.<br />Everything in Oliver's world starts to fall apart: his oldest son gets a girl pregnant and his mother with Alzheimer's is in an accident and dies.<br />Through watching his family cope with the obstacles in their lives and watching his father fall in love again, Oliver realizes that he too must move on with his life.<br />This was the first Danielle Steel novel that I read and I was impresses.  It wasn't just a tawdry romance novel.<br />There was also a made-for-TV movie based on this book.  It starred Patrick Duffy (Oliver), Linda Carter (Charlotte) and Kate Mulgrew (Sarah).  Ben Affleck played the oldest son.
I really love this calender. The pictures are bright, I have plenty of room to write in birthdays and my schedule.  However, it is a almost twice as much as the other calendars I was looking at.
A lot of the examples in this book can be quite boring. If you don't know a lot of about editing, this is a good book to read through a couple of the examples.  I use it for as a reference guide when I'm writing my Works Cited page.  I often get confused on the difference for scholarly journals, web articles, and the various ways to list books.
\\"Green Eggs & Ham\\" is my favorite book by Dr. Seuss.  I have even read it in Spanish, though my Spanish is VERY weak, it was fun to read.  I have read this book so many times that I have it memorized.  It is great when little kids want me to read the book because I get all excited during the reading and will make funny faces when Sam I Am offers green eggs and ham.<br />This book is a classic and just plain fun to read.  To add to the \\"Green Eggs & Ham\\" fun, try making green eggs for breakfast.
When I first saw \\"If I'm So Wonderful, Why Am I Still Single?\\", the first thought that popped into my mind was, \\"You can't be that wonderful if you're picking up this book.\\"  The title of the book really bothered me, so I kept thinking about it. Later, I thought, \\"Someone must have a pretty big head to think that they are so perfect.\\"  I think a different main title would have been more appropriate for the book, but that's just my opinion.<br />Anyway, the book does present 10 points that you can apply to your life.  They are pretty good, too, as long as you apply them consistantly.  That's not to say that your emotions can't 'get in the way', because they undoubtedly will.  I've also found not to be too hard on myself when relationship don't work out.  Some things just aren't 'meant to be'.  This may be extremely hard if you have a significant other who tells you everything that you ever did wrong in the relationship.<br />Read the book, ignore the title, apply the 10 tips to your life.
When I first read the title, I thought is was a dating Bible for losers.  However, I agree with another reviewer, the title is misleading.  It's really about being confident, projecting that confidence and how others perceive you.<br />This book WON'T make anyone fall in love with you.  BUT, you can use this book to change how your prospective partners perceive you.  Even if you only build close friendships, this book is a good buy.
The tree is portrayed as a female and gives everything to the little boy as he grows into a man with no thought of him giving back to her in some way. Basically, some have analyzed this is be male on female abuse. However, you can also look at it from a mother's perspective. The mother gives all she has, unconditionally for the most part, to her child. We wouldn't call that abuse.<br />We call it Mother Nature and Mother Earth, so wouldn't it be fitting that the tree be gendered as female? And, for the most part, when this was written, it was \\"a man's world.\\"<br />Personally, I think this Shel Silverstein's little social commentary can be quite thought provoking for an adult and open up a dialect with a child about helping others.<br />OR maybe we're over-analyzing. :c)
I like all  kinds of music and think this book is great.  It has a lot of hard to find songs. This book is for all C treble clef instruments (vocie, flute, recorder, piccolo, harmonica, violin, oboe, viola).<br />What's a fake book?<BR>A fake book has the melody line only, so for piano players, there isn't a left hand part.<br />Do keep in mind that this book was published in 1994, so it doesn't have any of the songs from 1994 on.
I was required to read this for my high school English class. I'm not a big fan of reading novels that are required because I the majority of them to be quite boring.  This novel was not.<br />Pecola Breedlove is just a young girl growing up in Lorrain, Ohio.  Her family lives in the first floor of a building that used to be a store front.  There, she is raped by her father and becomes pregnant.  The baby is born premature and dies.<br />&quot;The Bluest Eye&quot; comes from Pecola's wish that she were a white child, the have bright, beautiful, blue eyes.  The white children where her mother works live in paradise compared to Pecola.<br />I found this novel to be quite captivating.  I was unable to put it down.  However, it is not a book for the faint of heart and the ending isn't &quot;...and they all lived happily ever after.&quot;
This book gets 5 stars...  If you don't know what a fake book is, it is only going to have the melody line (for the piano part, it will only have the right hand, not the left).<br />The book with the RED cover is for C instruments (piano, guitar, harmonica, violin, flute, recorder, oboe, viola).<BR>The book with the GREEN cover is B-Flat instruments (clarinet, tenor saxophone, soprano saxophone, trumpet, baritone T.C.).<BR>The book with the BLUE cover is for E-Flat instruments (alto saxophone, baritone saxophone).<br />It is about a level 4-5 on a difficulty scale of 1-10 with 1 being the easiest and 10 being the hardest.
I bought \\"Felicity Learns A Lesson\\" and really enjoyed it.  It is a great way to get young girls interested in history by allowing them to peer into the lives of young girls of that time period.<br />This book, set in Williamsburg, Virginia in 1774 is great. Felicity is going to school to become a lady. She learns the proper way to serve and drink tea, as well as needle point. She even makes a friend, Elizabeth, but Elizabeth's father is a loyalist and Felicity's father is a patriot.<br />The last part of the book is a more in depth history lesson about Felicity's time period.<br />All of the \\"American Girls\\" books are great ways to teach and get young girls interested in history.
Molly lives in 1944 and wishes to be Miss Victory in the tap dance recital. Her older sister helps with her hair and when it comes time for auditions, Molly takes off her glasses because she wants to look the part of a star.<br />MOLLY GETS THE ROLE!<br />Right before the big show, Molly catches a cold.  She can't be Miss Victory.  However, on the day of the show, Molly gets a surprise that is better than tapping in the sparkling Miss Victory costume.<br />This is the best Molly book.<br />The last chapter of the book explains what it is like in 1944 with the war and the efforts on the home front.
This book was a required reading for one of my college history classes. It does start a little slow, but once it picks up, it is almost impossible to put down. As with &quot;The Clockwork Orange&quot;, I wrote a little reference card on a notecard, just in case I forgot what one of the words the book used meant, I had my bookmark/notecard to look it up on.
I had to read this book for a book report and found it difficult to follow. If I had to stop in the middle of a chapter, I would start reading and be confused. If I had the time to read whole chapters without interruption, I think I would have had an easier time reading and comprehending this book.<br />At first, I wasn't sure if the beginning was the present and Shangri-La was a flashback/narrative or if the beginning of the book was the prelude to ending up at Shangri-La.
The \\"Essential Elements 2000: A Comprehensive Band Method\\" is a great book for a young person who is learning an instrument for the first time. There is a fingering chart in the back of the book to make looking up fingerings quick and easy. The book starts off very basic with the parts of the instrument. The easiest notes to play and finger are presented first with exercises to practice them. This book comes with a play-along CD. This CD includes all solo exercises.<br />Hal Leonard also offers (though not through Amazon) band sets for band directors.  They are simple arrangements of music that correlate with the book.  They are great for the first concert.<br />There is an older version of this book called \\"Essential Elements: A Comprehensive Band Method\\".  The book is purple and has many of the same features as this one, but the CDs have to purchased separately.

There is some information that Amazon really should put in their descriptions of the products, especially music books.<br />Two Versions:<BR>There are 2 versions of the book.

This book is for late beginners to beginning intermediate pianists.<br />Keep in mind that these have been ARRANGED for piano solo, so they aren't going to sound exactly like the music from the Peanuts specials. I believe that music on the specials was performed by the Vince Guaraldi Trio, not just a piano.

I had to have this book for a college intro to statistics class. I'm not very math inclined, and this book was no help. The 'examples' are not clear and easy to follow.<br />One of the things that I did find helpful in this book is when they list the steps to use an equation in text, without the numbers.  Fortunately, the professor was able explain the equations.<br />If you are trying to teach yourself statistics:<BR>1.) get a life  :c)<BR>2.) don't get this book<br />If you are getting this as a textbook for school:<BR>hope you have a good math prof.
I had to have this book for a college &quot;Intro to Biology&quot; and it was great.  The book has a lot of information that I needed for class.  It was easy to read, which was really great since I had a full class load.  There are also really good diagrams and pictures to illustrate the examples and concepts from the book.
This book covers some of the most controversial shows from the Jerry Springer Show, with pictures.  There are also comments from the staff of the show about what they do.  This book should be taken with a grain of salt, it is meant as entertainment.
This is the book for my &quot;Introduction to Electronic Mass Media&quot; class.  It is VERY boring to read.  The professor seldom refers to it, maybe 3 or 4 times in class.  However, there are some very good sections, that even though they aren't interesting, they are useful.  An example is the 2 sections on semiotics.  There is an entire chapter that can be used as a outline for a semiotic analysis, as well as an appendix in the back of the book about a semiotic analysis, with pictures.<br />One thing that really stands out when you think of books that are used as college textbooks, this one doesn't have vocab words.  Though a lot of students hate vocab because it is one more thing for the prof to put on the test, I think that it would be useful in this book because there are a lot of terms (i.e. semiotics, gender codes, etc.) that can be summed up in a sentence or two, so that the student will have a better understand and will be about to follow.  It would also be nice to have the terms bold-faced for studying.<br />There is a lot of information in this book, but it is one of those books that you either have to be really into media or you have to force yourself to read.
When I bought this book, it was purely because of the price and for an entertainment factor.  When I got the book, I almost immediately started reading it.  I found his childhood very fascinating.<br />One of the parts that seemed to bore me a bit was his conversation with God.  But after that, the book really seems to pick up.<br />I knew some of the things about Springer, like the check at the 'massage parlor', but I didn't know many of the details behind it.  Perhaps this was a way for Jerry to set the record straight, and to purge his soul.<br />In interviews, he rarely mentions his ex-wife, Mickey, or daughter, Katie.  This book has only a chapter about his family, with 2 or 3 pictures.  It was a side of Jerry that only the people of Cincinnati saw.<br />I think that this would be a good book for anyone who judges Jerry and the Jerry Springer Show to read because it really expresses the theme that you are all human.
I had to have this book for a college music theory class, &quot;Rudiments of Music I&quot;. It has a lot of useful information in an easy to understand format, which is awesome for the college student who have about a million other books that they have to read.<br />One improvement that could be made it to add a companion audio CD or CD-ROM.  The aural training would be extremely useful when learning about the scales, especially the minor scales or when talking about perfect, major, minor, diminished or augmented pitches.  Understanding would greatly increase if you could hear them.<br />I thought that the book was a bit overpriced, considering that it is paperback with pictures and little text.<br />If you just want to see the different aspects of music and be able to identify them on a piece of sheet music, this is a good book.  If you want to pick out the different aspects of music when you hear them, find a CD that you can use in conjunction with this bok.
When I met Dave Pelzer a few years ago, you could see the chips still in his teeth from his head being slammed against the counter.  He showed off pictures of his wife Martha and his son Stephen.  Also in his wallet, his father's badge, which choked him up as he talked about it.<br />This book is good, but not captivating like the first.  I never quite understood why he felt that he needed to go back and see his mother.  One thing that I didn't like about this book is how it talked so much about the writing of &quot;A Child Called It&quot;.  Though that is how the relationship between Dave and Marsha developed.<br />Another reviewer mentioned that he never explained why his mother had become so evil.  I was thinking that too, but came to the conclusion that as a child, and even as an adult, he really didn't know.  My personal guess would be mental illness and alcoholism.<br />It was also mentioned that he stayed loyal to his father until the end, and she wasn't sure why.  If you read all 3 books, Dad stayed at the firehouse more and wasn't around.  As a child, he idolized his father and his father never hurt him.  I think Dave also saw more, especially when his father died, how his mother was toward his father and realized that's part of the reason he stayed away.<br />All in all, if you have read the first 2 books, you should read this one.  You will see how Dave did in the Air Force and see how he handled things with his birth parents in his adult life.
Ever since I read this in 10th grade, it has been my favorite book.  I have read it several times and each time, I find something in there that is new.  It is definately a timeless classic.<br />I think having Scout narrate the book as an adult looking back on her childhood isn't a new concept, but this is the kind of story that it works great in.  Seeing Macomb County through the eyes of a young child gives it a bit of nostalgic innocence.<br />If you want to see the movie, read the book first.
This was a book that I was required to read for my college history class.  I'm usually not big on books that are required, so I decided to get a headstart on this one so I could keep up in class.  The book starts a little slow, but by the time she gets to about middle school, and especially high school, I found myself unable to put the book down.  The imagery is amazing.  As Anne gets a little depressed and unmotivated, I could feel myself become unmotivated and read the book less.  I felt ackward reading about the situation with her mother when she and her sister were living together, you can just feel the tension in the dialogue.  This is a really good book to read, whether it's a requirement or not because it is full of a lot of personal insights.
The pictures in this book are VERY VIBRANT.  Each pages features a story in a rhyme scheme, making it sing-songy.  On the back of the book, there are some tips for parents about applying the book to your child's life.<br />Why only 4 stars?<BR>The flaps can tear if your child plays with this book.  I wish the creases of the flaps could be reinforced.<br />The best way to encourage your child to read is to have books in the home.
When I saw this book, it was the cover that caught my attention.  I was in the band and a lot of my life had a musical theme.  I didn't read the notes about the book, I just decided to get it.  I read it that night until I couldn't keep my eyes open and finished it the next day.  I decided that I wanted to have a copy of this book and ordered it at a local bookstore.  I re-read it when it arrived a few weeks later.<br />It is truly a great book and I'm sure my sister will enjoy reading it, too.
This is a really awesome book.  The pictures are very bright and will get your little ones attention.  The last page had 2 really great features: 1. there is a texture page, in this book it's sand; 2. you can see real photographs of pictures Violet took.<br />The best way to encourage a child to read is to have books in the home.
I read this book after a friend had read it and recommended it.  I was unable to put it down.  The imagery was so vivid that when he described having to eat his own vomit, I became physically ill and had to fight to keep myself from throwing up.  I cried myself to sleep the first night I got this book because my heart ached.  I know he made it out of his abusive situation.  My heart ached for the children who don't and the ones currently in abusive homes.<br />When I met Dave Pelzer a few years ago, you could see the chips still in his teeth from his head being slammed against the counter.  He showed off pictures of his wife Marsha and his son Stephen.  Also in his wallet, his father's badge, which choked him up as he talked about it.<br />This book really caused me to think about abuse in a different light.  Now just child abuse, but abuse in general, whether it be spouse or child abuse.  It really pointed out that a large part of abuse if the psychological aspect.
I first tuned into the radio show the day after Christmas several years ago.  I thought it was just the local DJ and changed the channel.  Then I went back, what they were talking about was interesting.  Well, I was hooked.<br />I bought this book not too long after it came out.  I had to drive to a book store becaue none of the local department stores that have books carried this one.  I read it and found it easy to understand, especially with Adam's interjections.  It was also entertaining.<br />I also used it as a source for a paper I was writing in high school on teen's with mental illness.  I don't remember the exact citation, but my teacher thought that using a book geared at teens for a paper on teens was a good idea.  Most of the sources for my paper were psychology books.<br />When I went to see Dr. Drew at Butler University in Indianapolis, Indiana, he made little mention of the book.  He was there mostly to promote his former website.<br />I really liked the format of the book.  It was set up kind of as a question and answer session.  The answers to each question weren't long and drawn out, so there wasn't a problem with information overload.
When I met Dave Pelzer a few years ago, you could see the chips still in his teeth from his head being slammed against the counter.  He showed off pictures of his wife Martha and his son Stephen.  Also in his wallet, his father's badge, which choked him up as he talked about it.  He was also doing a book-signing for &quot;Help Yourself&quot;.<br />Considering Dave Pelzer was the author, I thought that this book would be along the lines of his previous 3, maybe a new installment in his life, but it is a self-help book, which was a bit disappointing.  This book has some very good advice.<br />If you expect the typical Dave Pelzer story writing, you will be disappointed with this book.  If you are looking for a self-help book on your mental attitude and resilience of the human spirit, you should read this book.
As with all Baby Einstein books, this one has incredibly colorful and vibrant pictures.  A few other reviewers commented on the quality of the mirrors, they are thin reflective film with a 'fun house' effect, but the 0-9 month age group really isn't going to care.  Each page features simple text for younger ones with a mirror.  The back of the book has 3 tips and ideas for parents.<br />The best way to encourage your child to read is to have books in the home.
When I met Dave Pelzer a few years ago, you could see the chips still in his teeth from his head being slammed against the counter.  He showed off pictures of his wife Marsha and his son Stephen.  Also in his wallet, his father's badge, which choked him up as he talked about it.<br />This 2nd book in Pelzer's trilogy follows his journey through California's foster care system.  I learned a lot about his past and how his abuse affected his adolescent life, a time that is tough enough if you've had a pretty good home life.  I didn't find this book as captivating as the first, but this one will still grab your attention.  I knew that he'd made it out okay and had made something positive out of his life, but just following him until he found his 'home' with his final set of foster parents.  I can only imagine how difficult it must have been to have all of those attachments just severed.<br />My favorite line is one of the last lines in the book, \\"Aboard my first plane rise, I opened my eyes for the first time as a man named Dave.\\"
This book is great.  Each page has colorful pictures with a 2-line rhyme.  There are also 2 flaps to lift.  The first page has flaps for chair and dollhouse.  When you lift the chair flap, there is a bear.  When you lift the dollhouse flap, there is a mouse.<br />Why only 4 stars?<BR>The flaps, even though they are made of a heavy, cardboard-like material, tear.  I wish there was some reinforcement on the crease of the flaps to help prevent tearing.<br />The best to encourage your child to read is to have books in the home.
I found this book to have a lot of useful information, but it starts off very wordy.  I don't care about the author's whole life history and reason she decided to write this book.  Establishing that could be done in a page, not 4.<br />The Pregnancy Diet<BR>There is a recipe section, that if I had the time, may be of some use.  However, making cream of tomato soup from scratch is time consuming and more expensive that buying the can and adding milk.  All of the recipes in that section need to be made from scratch, even the French fries, not a practical suggestion for someone who has a job.<br />Part 2 - Nine Months &amp; Counting<BR>The Question &amp; Answer format was really helpful.  Most of the questions give you about half a page of really useful information, with facts, but not overstating the answer to the question presented.<br />Part 3<BR>From postpartum to breastfeeding to Daddy, the section mixes the Q &amp; A format with the informational format from the 1st section of the book.  This section is very useful for understand your postpartum 1-6 weeks and tips for breastfeeding holds.  The &quot;Expectant Father&quot; section is in the Q &amp; A format, and may have some things that Mommy hasn't realized about Daddy.  You're husband or partner may not read the whole book, but is 1 chapter really gonna hurt him?<br />Part 4 - Special Concerns<BR>This was something that had never even crossed my mind until I read this book.  From common colds to measles, as well as how to deal with symptoms of illness.  &quot;I have a fever, should I take aspirin?&quot; and a bunch of other questions like that.  It is an informative section that some may not even think about when they are expecting.<br />Pregnancy Notes section<BR>I think that this is a very creative section because you have 2 pages to write down your personal notes for each month.  The book also suggests that you show the notes to your doctor, so they know what's going on, since they can't be with you 24/7.
I had to have this book for my first year college speech class.  It was interesting to read, but I wish that I didn't have to actually read so much of the book to get the meanings.  Part of that is not knowing HOW to read a college text book.<br />Being a Media &amp; Public Communications major, and I can see how this book is really useful for incoming freshman.  Most have only given speeches in high school and need to develop the skills for giving good speeches and presentations in college and beyond.<br />This book really lays out the process for speeches and your behavior.  What kind of non-verbal cues are you sending?  There is also a pseudo-outline (you actually have to pick out the details from the reading) for laying out a speech.
I think at times, this book tends to over-state things and sometimes the means are unclear.  In the 4th Edition, there are examples to illustrate means, which helps with understandings.<br />If you've read any of Julia T. Wood's other communication books, one thing that always sticks out on your head is how she talks about Robbie.  She doesn't just say her husband. (This led to a long talk in my interpersonal communication class.)<br />I think, and by no fault of Wood's, that universities focus on her books, and the students don't get a broader view of communication.
I like classical music, but some of the pieces tend to be too long.  When I saw this, I figured that I would give it a try.  I really liked the character on the front, even though he was designed to get the attention of little ones.<br />The music on this CD is very easy to listen to.  I listen to it when I'm putting laundry away, when I'm driving, etc.  The pieces are short, so there aren't the super slow lagging sections.  Each piece is also played by different instruments than the traditional classical music, so it makes it entertaining to listen to.<br />Whether you have little ones or not, if you enjoy classical music, you should give this CD a shot.
I bought this book when I was an education major in college.  The text in this book is very simple, so it is easy for little ones to understand.<br />What really caught my eye were the pictures.  There are paintings, drawings and photos.  My favorite picture in the book is a photo of a little duckling.  The camera can see above and below the water, so the picture is just awesome.<br />The pictures are worth it.  There are different colors, different kinds of birds, different textures.  I think that it is a really creative way to introduce a child to art.<br />The best way to encourage a child to read is to have books in the home.
When I was majoring in education, I bought a lot of books for my classroom.  I was planning on teaching small children, so I bought this book.<br />The back of the book says that it is for ages 1 to 4, but most 4 years can count past 5.  Still, if you consider it be be for say ages 1 to 3, I think it is a very good book.<br />The pictures are bright, like other books from the Baby Einstein Company. The bees are cute!  The text in the book is kept simple, so it is easy for little ones to comprehend.<br />The best way to encourage a child to read is to have books in the home.
First off, I would like to say that the Baby Einstein puppy is so cute. This book is for ages 1 month and up. The text in this book is very simple, so little ones can understand it. The pictures are perhaps one of the best features because they vary so much.  There are paintings, drawings and photos.  All with different colors, textures and actions.<br />The best way to encourage a child to read is to have books in the home.
I bought this book when I was an education major.  The first thing I really noticed were the pictures.  The text is very simple, but the pictures; paintings, photos and drawings; really caught my eye.  These are standard children's book illustrations.  Each picture has different colors and different visible textures.  Some have movement, some are still.<br />The best way to encourage a child to read is to have books in the home.
When I was majoring in education, I bought a bunch of books for my classroom.  I bought this book because I thought it would be a creative way to teach SHAPES.<br />Each page has a little 4 line rhyme that really got my attention.  It was kind od sing-songy and describes the shape.<br />The pictures are very bright and colorful.  The pictures are also of the shape the poem was about.<br />The best way to encourage a child to read is to have books in the home.
This book was used in my college English Lit. class to help students be more critic of things that they read, whether it be a textbook or a magazine article.  Most of the essays in the book have major flaws.  The one that I remember the best was written by Dick Clark and was about Elvis Presley.  Clark makes the comment that Elvis didn't write his own songs, which is untrue (as blanket statements tend to be).  Anyway, Elvis wrote at least 2 hits, one with Vera Matson (Love Me Tender) and another with Otis Blackwell (Don't Be Cruel).<br />Though many of these essays are poorly written, this is a good textbook for developing with critical reading skills.
As a future educator, I fine myself looking at educational books and looks. The main reason I was drawn to this is bacause I am a huge Hello Kitty fan. After flipping through some of the pages, I decided that I liked what I saw and it could be useful in the classroom.
