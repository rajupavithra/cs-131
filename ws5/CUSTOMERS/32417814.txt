&quot;What has happened the Christian community?? This is one of the worst books I've read. Right from the start Eldredge claims that Bible Study is boring. That has not been my experience when learning about our God! Then he goes on to say that God called an evil infested creation &quot;Good&quot;. Eldredge has created for himself a god that is different than the God of the Bible. God called His creation &quot;Good&quot; BEFORE sin entered. The &quot;wildness&quot; that Eldredge relishes is a result of sin. Next he completely denies the Omniscience of God. To state that &quot;God took a risk&quot; is to imply that God does not know the outcome. That is a denial of the God of the Bible. I'm greatly saddened by the popularity of this book! I'm greatly saddened by the state of God's people if they can't discern the poor theology of this book. It doesn't belong on Christian bookstore shelves.&quot;

&quot;I was disappointed with this book. Dr. Crabb states that a man's greatest need is significance and a woman's greatest need is security. My understanding of the Bible is that the single greatest need for both men and women is salvation and sanctification. Not only is the assessment of man's need wrong, he says that this must be dealt with BEFORE Biblical principles can be applied. A better approach would be to apply biblical principles to the lives of men and women and allow the Holy Spirit to work in them so that they will find their security and significance in Christ alone.&quot;
\\"What an eye-opener. Dr. Almy does a great job of illustrating the Biblical Counseling position. His comparison of Christian Counseling with Biblical Counseling in the first section alone is worth buying the book, even if your not into the history behind it. The rest of the book is just that - history of how psychology has become so pervasive in the church. Every pastor and lay person should read this book and begin now to weed the psychological influences out of the church!  Along with this book, I would highly recommend \\"Competent to Counsel\\", \\"How to Help People Change\\", \\"Psychobabble\\", and \\"Why Christians Can't Trust Psychology\\".
