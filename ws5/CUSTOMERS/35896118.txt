I am not only a huge fan of all genres of literature.  I am not only a published novelist/writer.  But I am one of the biggest Motley Crue fans to ever walk the planet.  This book tells the story of four idols.  The REAL story and not some hollywood/MTV fake story for 13 year olds.  Nikki Sixx, Vince Neil, Tommy Lee and Mick Mars all tell the past twenty years (and their own very different childhoods) from their own point of view without holding back anything.  I can tell you now that not only is the Dirt the best source of info about the great band Motley Crue for fans, but will be a great book for ANYONE who is open minded.  The book is raw and exciting.  There is only one dull moment that I can remember, but then again there are people that I know that say that it is their favorite part of the book so I will not say which part it is.<br />All in all, the only thing I can say is this... \\"Wow!\\"  If you hate reading, if you hate or love rock'n roll, if you are a man or woman, if you are a monkey you will love this book and it is more than worth it to buy.  Trust me on this, okay?
First, I would like to state that I read almost all of the reviews of this book and I would like to tell you, the future reader, that almost every single bad review on this book on this site came from people that [obviously] did not really pay attention to what they were reading.  I am not saying that people couldn't dislike this book, but these specific reviewers missed so much that it is hard to believe that they did more than skim through the book.  If there is one thing that Goodkind does good, it is making sure that everything that happens CAN happen in his world and nothing is too far fetched.<br />While Goodkind does seem to take a lot from Robert Jordan, the overall story is completely compelling.  I spent hours upon hours reading this book because I could NOT put it down.  It seems like anything can happen and many times anything does.  Sometimes the conclusions are rushed and there are things that don't seem all that important, but there is always a fast pace that will make you want to know what happens next.  I must admit that I had a hard time getting though Khalan's first chapters and after she was alone and there were a few boring chapters in Galea I thought that either I didn't like the character or that her part in the book would be boring.  Trust me.  It is the best part of the book after you get past those few chapters of nothing.<br />If you are a fantasy reader and are not of the weak at heart.  You will love this book.  One word of advice though.  Try to read large chunks at one time or in one day.  If you try to read Goodkind and only read ten pages a day, you will NOT get the full effect of the book.  I'm not sure why, but with everyone I have talked to it is the same case.  Some I have talked to read it slowly and hated it.  I told them to go back and read more at a time and then they loved it.
There is one thing that you will not like about this book.  It will have you wanting MORE at the end.  I do not mean that the story is lacking by any means, though.  I mean that you will want to know what happens next to the characters and hear more of their stories.  <br />This is actually two books in one.  Half of it takes place in Tobyn Ser revolving around Jaryd and the other half in Lon Ser revolving around Meylor.  I found it very amazing how Coe seemed to change the characters (there is a ten year period between the happenings in the first book and the third) while keeping them the same.  Coe's ability to tell a story is one of the best.  You will not get bored or recieve any filler all the while being on they edge of your seat.  I had trouble putting this book down and though it is not so in depth as many other fantasy series, it is fun if nothing else.  Definately read this series.

To be completely honest, I read the first third of this book and almost stopped because there was nothing special about it.  The reader finds out pretty much everything in the form of who is who within the first hundred pages and there is very little character development, if any. <br />Luckily, I decided to tough out the book and finish it.  I couldn't have been more sorry if I hadn't.  Goodkind sends the reader on a journey though a very corrupt world of hidden magic.  Unlike most other epic series writers, Goodkind tells a very good story and does not leave loose ends untied while still leaving the reader wanting more.  There is a dark way that one sees the story told in Wizard's First Rule and suspense will keep you reading if nothing else.  Throughout the story, the characters do take on a life of their own and become very unique and different.  Also, it is not hard in the slightest to keep up with what is happening or who is who, but that does not mean that the book is too simple.  If anything it makes the story better because one does not have to go back and reread or try to remember who every character is and where they stand every time there is a scene with them.<br />All in all, this is a great and well told epic fantasy that all should read.  And while Goodkind seems to have borrowed from Robert Jordan for the Sword of Truth series, don't let that discourage you into thinking that Goodkind does not tell a enthralling and distinctive story.
This book is a theory.  As the Bible is a theory, the Torah, the Koran.  Albeit much more interesting and not so hypocrytical, that is all it is and I think that what Anne Rice did with this book is put all her own theories into a story and instead of being rudiculed for writing a Religion book (a book that would actually be in the religious section of the bookstore) she decided to throw Lestat in there and pass it off as fiction.<br />The non-theory part of the book (also the parts that actually concern Lestat, which is only about 1/4 at most of the book) is pretty good.  There seems to be a long work-up in the begining and after 300 pages of dialog and only a few paragraphs of action, it seems like Rice rushed the ending and decided to throw in one minor tragedy which could be summerized in her own words as, \\"Armand, Armand.\\"<br />So if you want to read a book and hear a new theory on God and the Devil (at it really is not a bad theory, mind you.  As a matter of fact, it is the best I have ever really heard with the exception, of course, of \\"There is no God\\") then go ahead and read this book.  If you are looking for an important piece to the Vampire Chronicles, then skip this book.
In the first book of what looks to be a great series, Martin tells a masterful story from the viewpoints of eight very unique and uncommon fantasy heroes.  While Lord Eddard Stark's bastard son, Jon Snow, is dealing with his hard life on The Wall, there is trouble brewing in the Seven Kingdoms and across the sea.  A mystery sends Ned on a wild goose chase and eventually brings havoc to his entire family sending the Seven Kingdoms into war from three sides.  Daenerys, the \\"last\\" of her kin, tries to reclaim her family's once great status.<br />Martin does not fall prey to usual fantasy novel clich&eacute;s and provides both action and suspense while giving a very in depth and well-told story.  No one is immune to the hardships of this very realistic world and one shouldn't be surprised if the \\"bad\\" guy turns out to be the \\"good\\" guy and vice-versa.
This book was more tedious than the first one and in a sense harder to read.  The point of view jumped back and forth between almost every chapter and it seemed to me that there was no real imanent danger to the lives of the people in the book.  But nonetheless, this book was a very good story and Coe's world takes from many other's but is still very original and magnificant.  All in all, this book was a very good sequel (if not as good as the original) and I have already bought the third book because it left me wanting more.  I won't say &quot;Go out and buy this book and read it right now!&quot; but I would recommend this book and series to anyone who wants to find a well written story.  But make sure you read the first book Children of Amarid first because even though this book is not one of my favorites, the Children of Amarid is in the top three and if you don't read its sequels, you definately must read CoA.
First I would like to say what I actually thought about this book.  First off I will say that this book kept me just as - if not more - inticed as any of the other book (with the exception of maybe The Shadow Rising) and I found myself reading page after page and without realizing the sun starting to come up because I had read all night and finished a few hundred pages.  I was amazed with Mat's chapters, Mat has been my favorite character since Lord of Chaos and I just think that he is very well developed along with the rest of his gang.  I also enjoyed reading everyone else's chapters, but I think Elayne and Egwene should have lost a chapter or two in order to give more time to Rand (who everyone wanted to hear more about).  Perrin's chapters, I must admit, were tedious if only for the fact that he needs to get Faile back already and toughen up a little!  I know he has always been the cautious one, but come on!  I really did enjoy this book from beginining to end and I really enjoyed the chapters which were dedicated to the secondary characters of the book.<br />Now, what I Think that Jordan was doing was both giving us one last look at the main characters of the story in and bring us up to date on all the secondary characters.  People complain that there are too many characters and they should just be taken out, but personally I would like to hear more from all the secondary characters.  I don't mean give them their own chapters, but still mroe would be good.  I have also been dissapointed with the more recent books because amazing characters such as Juilin and Thom (ESPECIALLY Thom!) have had nothing to do with the overall plot of the story.  Jordan said in an interview that the series would be 12 books long so what he is doing now is getting the reader caught up on everything that is going to be important to the end of the series and the Final Battle.  I believe that what Crossroads of Twilight was was &quot;The Calm Before the Storm&quot; so to speak.  This book had little or no action in it, but the politics and mystery of the book was absolutly amazing.  Unfortunatly, Fantasy writing has become the hunge industry that it is for one reason.  It is the only genre in which an impatient reader can read a book because they expect only action and for that impatient reader who cannot see a great story line and plot when it is right under their nose, they will not enjoy this book as well as a real literary fan might (these are the people that I think have been writing the the reviews and saying how Jordan has ruined the series, Of course not all of these reviewers are as I have said, but I believe most are).  So for the real literary fan and a fan of the best fantasy series in circulation, you will love this book hopefully as much as I did.  For those of you who want action and quick pased writing without the greatest sub-plots and characters then you probably won't like this book.<br />I do think, however, that the next book MUST have certain things for me to keep my opinions.<br />1. Must have conclusions to everyone side plots<BR>2. End with only the Final Battle to look ahead to<BR>3. Have much action.  I said that this was a good book and it did not need action, but there cannot be two books in a row like that.<BR>4. All the main characters must come together finally<br />So in conclusion.  This book is an amazing read whatever happens, but for me to keep my faith in the series as strongly as I always have, it does have to get to the end.  As I said, this book must be &quot;the Calm before the Storm&quot; otherwise I might start siding with the other half of the people who have read this book and not liked it and in turn have started to not like the series.
First off, I would like to state that I am an author and am actually in the process of getting a book published as I type this.  So I write this both as a writer and as a literary fan and long time Fantasy reader.<br />The first thing I noticed while reading this book was that it is a very simple read.  There are not very many characters that you must keep up with and the plot and sub-plots are very easy to follow along with.  The language that Coe uses is that of anyone who speaks common english and it is not necessary to read something through twice in order to understand what is happening (such as in Lord of the Rings).  <br />The suspence of finding out who the traitor is somehow sneaks up on you without you realizing it and before you know it, Coe sets up a perfectly written tone shift and progression.  The plot turns and revelations are - as a previous reviewer has pointed out - very simple, yet unpredictable and enticing.  One cannot go into reading this book (or any other book for that matter) thinking too much.  You should read this book and let your imagination take you into Coe's world - which is completely and easily reachable due to his simple discription and character development - and live the magnificence of a very FUN book.<br />I look foward to reading it's sequels in the very near future (I already have them on my book shelf) and I say that for someone knew to Fantasy (or even to reading itself) or for a veteran such as myself, you will not be dissapointed in this book.
