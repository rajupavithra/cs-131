Of all the books I've ever read, this is my favorite by far.  Personally, this book has brought me through a period in my life that seems to parallel Lestat's almost exactly and maybe that is why this book means the world to me.  From his suffocating &quot;Dark Moment&quot; toward the beginning where he realizes life might just end and that's it, only nothingness...   to the lonliness he feels later, where it seems like it is only him, even though he thinks he might have someone as his companion forever, he ends up alone again.<br />I would think that this book has to be enjoyed by anyone who likes a book with so many rich descriptions of life and searching, especially those that like a book with a gothic touch.<br />I couldn't say enough about this book, I'm sure you would enjoy it but if you relate to Lestat at all you'll fall completely in love with it and might want to thank the author somehow for putting all of your own feelings on paper as if she understood exactly what is in your own soul.
