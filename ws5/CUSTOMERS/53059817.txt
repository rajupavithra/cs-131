The exciting style kept my interest all the way through, so I enjoyed it, but the plot was so implausible that I kept gagging on it. The actions of the characters was almost uniformly stupid. I know it was just to keep the plot going, but really! Just one example, why didn't the bad guys burn the lawyer's office after they took the files! There are many worse ones from beginning to end, but I don't want to spoil the plot for anyone.<br />One of my pet peeves is the absolutely inaccurate science. If someone is exposed to radiation, they do not become radioactive, do not pose a threat to anyone, and do not have to be kept behind lead walls. The plutonium health effects were laughably wrong. No wonder the public is confused on the subject of radiation. <br />I couldn't put it down, but it was painful.
Those who find this book &quot;ground breaking&quot; or that it &quot;spins their minds&quot; have done very little reading in philosophy, theology, or modern physics. The ideas presented by the author have been thoroughly covered, and this book adds nothing to them. In fact, much of what he proposes has been investigated and discarded. His science is just plane wrong. If the author had studied these areas, he would not have wasted his time, and ours, in this simple-minded essay.<BR>Go read some serious books on these topics instead.
The publishers put a new cover on this 1874 text as though it were current, but it is only of historical value. We've learned a lot about the Bible and ancient Israel in the last 127 years. <br />The author doesn't even do what he proposes; many of the &quot;explanations&quot; consist of saying that he doesn't understand it but he believes that there is no contradiction or he proposes outlandish explanations that conflict with the clear meaning of the text. I think this undermines the Bible's reliability - if it doesn't mean what it says, how can I trust anything it says!<br />A quaint book with some interesting explanations.
This book outlines how to prepare sermons with a very simple technique. There are no short cuts or tricks; it simply approaches sermon preparation from a different angle. The main thesis of the book is that you should never use written notes when delivering your sermon. Dr. Webb explains in full why this is necessary, but basically you communicate better with people when you are looking at them (which is impossible to do completely when you are referring to notes).  <br />Since you wonÕt be using written notes in the pulpit, you need to deliver a different kind of sermon. There shouldnÕt be (cannot be) a complicated outline or a manuscript with finely crafted paragraphs. Instead you will simply talk with your congregation, relating a series of stories, events, ideas. Preparing a sermon that you can remember is a wonderfully liberating experience.  <br />I took a class from Dr. Webb at the Northwest House of Theological Studies in Salem, Oregon while he was a faculty member at Claremont School of Theology. That has forever changed the way I preach, and the people in my church react well to the new kind of sermon. There is still a lot of preparation, but now you can be more effective.  <br />A wonderful little book that is a must for any preacher. Give it a try.
This is a wonderful book that explores the complexities of how to live an honorable, Christian life in a society that approves of discrimination. In a world where laws and social prejudice dictate that some humans are less worthy than others, how is a Christian to act if he or she is a member of the oppressing class, or a member of the oppressed class? What can or should one do? The parallels for today are powerful for those who look. <br />My only criticism of this gripping tale is that the evil characters donÕt even pretend to be Christians, and the Christian characters always are good, even if they are weak. In my experience, sometimes Christians deliberately do evil things, and many non-Christians are wonderfully moral and loving people.<br />Nevertheless, this is a book well worth reading and discussing with your friends. It is told in a manner that involves the reader on all levels. Marvellously written - powerful message.

I can't believe that no one has written an online review of this book yet! The NIB is the best Bible commentary written. If you are serious about scholarly study of the Bible, you need to buy the entire series. It is  expensive to buy 12 volumes at $60-70 each, even if you save 30% through  amazon.com like I did ;). In that case, check with your church or library.  As a fall-back try Harper's or Jerome's for single volume commentaries. If  at all possible, buy the NIB. Forget the earlier version of the IB.<br />The  NIB is the definitive standard for serious Bible scholarship.

The Harper Bible Commentary is a very readable and scholarly commentary. Very well written and easy to read. Not as thorough as the Jerome Bible Commentary but much easier to use. <br />It reviews each book of the Bible by  passage (not each verse). For more detail look to Jerome or (of course) the  New Interpreter's Bible.<br /> I keep it by my chair at home for quick  reference.

I have older The Jerome Biblical Commentary. It is the most scholarly and detailed single-volume Bible commentary I have (and I have lots). It is a bit difficult to read because of all the notes and references; and it seems  to be written for scholars so it doesn't &quot;dumb down&quot; anything.  Written by Roman Catholics but valuable for everyone (even United  Methodists like me).<br />Very thorough, very detailed, verse by verse  commentary, but a tough read.

In this book Finke and Stark take a very analytical and careful approach to why some denominations grow and others shrink. Rather than rehashing the same ideas and theories, the perform numerical analysis of the actual  percentage of Americans in each denomination, state by state, from 1776 to  1990. The results are amazing.<br />United Methodists: note that our church  has been shrinking since _1850_ as a percentage of the American public.  Basically since the circuit riders dismounted and we established  seminaries.<br />The conclusions are frightening and will make you reevaluate  &quot;what's wrong with our church&quot;. If this book is correct, most of  the solutions suggested by other books will not address the core  issues.<br />You must read this book!!!
I stumbled across this Bible by accident, and am I glad I did. Along with the Oxford Annotated Bible, this is the best study Bible available for scholars. <br />The notes are clear and illuminating. For a balanced view you  can read this in parallel with the NIV Study Bible. It will show the  deficiencies in that approach.
Don't let Ceresko's title scare you off. He does apply a Liberation  Theology perspective to the Old Testament, but the scholarship is first  rate and main stream. It is a well-rounded and user-friendly help in  understanding the Hebrew Bible. Each chapter pretty much stands on its own  so you can start anywhere you wish, e.g., the Psalms.<br />This was the most  helpful text for my seminary class on the Old Testament.
