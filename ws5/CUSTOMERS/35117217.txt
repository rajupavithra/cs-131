J.K. Rowing is such a detailed writer, with twists and turns all around.  I believe completely that things aren't as they seem.  Appearances can be changed and senses tricked in these books.  That is what is really fun about these books.  Things are so complex, that there is no way anyone can be sure how things will turn out in the end.  J.K. Rowing is not a stagnant writer whose writing is predictable.  This books reveals a lot of new information and creates new questions to be answered in the last book.  Fans will not be completely disappointed, although they will definitely go through mourning at the end.
I got this book thinking it was a comic book.  I obviously didn't read the description carefully enough.  This is basically a long poem about being a grandmother.  I was disappointed at first, but not I think I'll give it to my mom when she becomes a grandma for the first time.  I do think that it needs to be clear that this is not a comic.  It is simply a poem that is illustrated with FBOW characters.
These books are so good at helping kids learn the parts of speech. They give so many clear examples of sentences, with the specific part of speech in a different color so everyone will notice it. I used these in a classroom during english class and they all loved it. A+ to this book! <br />

I have always enjoyed the adult series of Left Behind books.  The kids books are just as good.  The kids interact with the characters from the adult series, experience the same events, etc.  However, since the main characters are teens, these books can appeal to younger readers.  So far, the stories haven't had the ups and downs that the adult series has had.  The adult series has books that are a lot more boring than others.  The kids series seems to be good in every book.  These are not for really young kids, but would be appropriate for young teens.  I enjoy them and I am an adult.

I found this book incomplete.  It's missing a crucial element: its resolution.  True, Jill finds out what Wendy is really like, but no one made up with Linda.  I went through some of the things Linda had to go through (thankfully not as severe).  It really bugs me that people spent the whole book treating Linda so terribly and no one even tried to make up with her.  I thought that, at least after what Jill had been through, she'd want to try to make up with Linda.  In the end, she should have decided to try sitting with Linda, instead of Rochelle.  Or maybe Linda and Rochelle.  I think that would have sent a strong and important lesson to children.  Without apologizing to Linda, the book has a gaping hole.  The kids learned not to follow Wendy, but not how to make things right with those they hurt while following Wendy.
I was best friends with the authors daughter for about 10 years.  She is a really nice person (so is her daughter:).  What I really like about this book is that she knows what things are really like in Taiwan, since she lived there for many, many years.  The situations Amy gets into are realistic, so it's also a glimps into what life in Taiwan really is like.  A great piece of work Deb!
This book was lent to me by a friend.  It is an interesting book.  Some of the theories, especially about the possible endings, are crazy, but some are plausible.  Anything is possible in the world of Harry Potter.  If I had read this book before book three and she suggested that Scabbers might not be a rat, I would probably have said she was off her rocker.  But, though, if it all turns out to be a dream in the end, I might scream!
The first half of this book was pretty good, but then it fizzled out.  I kind of felt evil when I kept skipping the parts when Jesus talked.  They tended to overkill ideas.  For example, when everyone hears Jesus say their name at the same time.  I got the idea the first time.  The second time wasn't too bad, but when they repeated the idea over and over, it got boring.  All in all, though, it was an ending.
This book starts with a story about Masai culture and also an introduction to how to say their numbers.  What really fascinated me were the facts in the back.  It tells you about Tanzania, the Masai culture, some words in their language and also a little about how they name their children.  I love learning about African culture so I absolutely loved this book!
You can learn so much about the presidents from this book.  I learned things the first time I read it!  The illustrations are excellent and the style is fun.  I love this book and kids love it, too.

This is another great adaptation of a classic story.  Mary has a ham instead of a lamb.  This ham is destined for showbiz, maybe in \\"Cinderswine\\".  It has puns and jokes that will keep adults chuckling, but kids will like it, too.
What would it be like to see life from the eyes of a doughnut?  Read Arnie the Doughnut to find out.  He finds out many terrible things in this book, yet he also finds good things.  One doughnuts fate is not the fate of the other doughnuts.
In this story, the Wodney Wat starts out as timid and tucked inside himself because he was teased for who he was.  As the book progresses, he becomes happier with himself and is able to have fun with all the students.  That was the happy ending, in my opinion.

This is a hilarious adaptation of the story of Rapunzel.  I read this to students in an elementary special education class and they also loved it.  The rhyming makes it fun for the kids to guess what Rapunzel throws down.  The prince will say, \\"Throw down your curly locks!\\" The next lines would say, \\"So Rapunzel threw out....\\" and the kids would have fun guessing what Rapunzel threw down.  Another teacher in the room stopped what they were doing and listened to the story as well.
In my opinion, this is the best Harry Potter book so far.  It introduces some of the best characters in this book.  Lupin is fantastic.  Buckbeak is a fascinating creature.  Harry also finds out so many neat things about his dad.  All the other books are good, but, because of these reasons, book 3 is the best.
This book has been able to explain my opinion of Harry Potter books better than I could myself. I don't know a single child who has become interested in the occult from Harry Potter. They are fantasy magic, and even with subjects such as divination, they are shown to be rediculous. This book encourages you to think for yourself. It also shows how you can see whatever you want to in books. No matter what other people say, I give this book an A+.
Many people say that this diet can work for everyone, but I don't believe it can. I know a few people who tried it and it didn't work. If you don't really like protein foods, you won't be able to do it. Also, my mom and grandma have irritable bowel syndrome and it was worse on Atkins. <BR>For people like me, however, it is perfect. I love meat and cheese. It was hard to get started, but once my blood sugar leveled out, I didn't have any more cravings. It was easy. I could be sitting right next to a cake and not want it at all. I have, so far, lost 30 pounds. I have starting excercising on a regular basis and I can lose up to about 4-6 pounds a week with excercising and Atkins.
This is one of my favorite books.  I enjoy reading stories written from the perspective of children slaves.  I liked the fact that she kept learning to read.  She did what she knew she had the right to do and didn't let other people hold her down.  This is a good book on the strength of the human spirit.
I found this book through Children's Book of the month club.  It is hilarious!  It's a creative idea, to make a story about a doughnut.  Great book for kids and adults alike.
Did you know that the wolf is really innocent?  He just had a cold.  This book can be a good introduction to the concept of two sides to every story.  It's creative and enjoyable to read.
I really love this book.  It kept my attention through the whole thing.  I loved the characters and I felt for them as they suffered. The characters were well formed and it helps show what it might be like to be a black family living in that era and what they had to put up with.
I read this book as an assignment for a children's literature class.  This book really kept my attention simply because of how odd it is.  It's odd, but interestingly odd.  Lois Lowry does a good job at keeping the mystery going.  She gives you clues all over the place so you can solve the mystery as you go.  It was masterfully written.  It also is full of topics to talk about, such as communism, abortion, euthenasia, etc.  It is a good book to get people thinking.
I found this book midly entertaining.  I read it on a car trip and it was fine, but I didn't absolutely love it.  I didn't care one way or the other whether I read it or not.  It was not the type of book that makes you really want to read it.
This is an excellent book that is leading up to an exciting last book.  I'm looking forward to the ending.  It's nice to see what lengths the boys will go to to save their sister, even if it means Jared getting in worse trouble with his mother (which he only got into in the first place trying to stop someone from stealing from Mallory).  Excellent book!
I love this book, but I have one problem with it.  There is one or two kids each from many different countries, with the exception of the United States.  There are 6 kids from the United States.  Why are we so over represented?  I would have rather seen one or two kids from the United States and the rest from other countries, maybe Scotland, England, etc.  There was no reason for all the kids from our country.  Many of the kids from the United States were very similar.

This book takes you behind the scenes and tells you how things were done.  It is very interresting and fun.
I found this book so refreshing.  Very rarely do you see books with a main character with a disability.  Whitney is portrayed as a normal girl, even though she has a disability, and that is how it really is.  So many books portray those with disabilities as weird, but Whitney is lovable and sweet.  An A++ book.
