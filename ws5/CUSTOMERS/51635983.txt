Dozois is, and has long been, one of the best editors and anthologizers in all of SF.  The anthology ranges over the many different sub-genres of Science Fiction, and I therefore cannot say I enjoyed all of his stories; nevertheless, all were well-written, and some of the stories were among the best I've ever read.  I strongly recommend this and any other of Dozois' &quot;Year's Best...&quot; series.
This book single-handedly interested me in etymology and linguistics.  Bill Bryson turns his well-known ability at writing humor and travel literature, and applies with ease toward the English language.  Neither this, nor his other work &quot;The Mother Tongue&quot;, should be missed!

This book is interesting, and contains many interesting ideas.  It's not worth the time spent reading the whole book, however.  Scan the beginnings of the chapters, and dip in where you find something interesting, but that's really all that's necessary.  The rest seems a bit too much like filler to me.

I don't know where this author gets his ideas.  Where does he come off calling the South Vietnemese &quot;Snookers? &quot;  They were our allies for crying out loud!  Without their help, Communism would today be running  rampant throughout our glorious nation, and we would all be atheists!  This  man should try living in a VietCong death camp for four years, 3 months, 6  days -- and then critize the US!
Blue Mars grabbed me and swept me through its pages as well and as quickly as the first two books.  Robinson deserved his Hugo for this, and more.  If you liked the first two books, this one will not disappoint.
