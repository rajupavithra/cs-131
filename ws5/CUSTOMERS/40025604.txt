This is a thoroughly engaging read.  The story and character development draw you in from the start and you are not disappointed up to the very end.  I was uncertain if Russo could make the jump from short stories and serial work to a fully developed novel.  He can, and did!  I place Russo in my top ten of sci-fi/fantasy/future vision writers.  His work is thought provoking, intriguing and, unlike many in the genre, he has a command of our language and a deeply intuitive feel for the pulse of our culture.  I have read Ship of Fools twice, if for no other reason than I am wanting for more Russo and until his next book I at least have a very good piece of work to satisfy that need.
