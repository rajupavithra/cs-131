Sir Charles Oman's comprehensive seven volume history of the Peninsular War is the yardstick by which any other history of this theatre must be measured. It is exhaustive in detail and in breadth of coverage. If it happened, it is in one of these volumes. Napoleon may have considered Spain a side show, but as results turned out it was a bleeding ulcer. French losses here, combined with the 1812 campaign, placed a strain on the Empire which could not be overcome by even the best generalship. Any true student of the Napoleonic Wars should find these books and read them. They are essential to a complete understanding of the conflict.

This is the best single volume history of the Russian Front in WW I that there is. Period. It covers the war from 1914 to the collapse of Russia in 1917. In just over 300 pages the author manages to cover every significant military action, all the politic dealings, the economic problems, and the diplomacy which lead to the collapse of Russia. A truly superb book.

This book is a must read for any one interested in the Seven Years' War. It will give you a whole new perspective on Russia's involvement in the conflict. Although it is not a recent book, there is no other volume to my knowledge which deals as thoroughly and succulently with Russia's role in the Seven Years' War as this book. While it is a relatively short work it is all that much more focused on its subject and delivers a big punch.

This book covers the roughly 100 years of the history and evolution - or lack thereof - of the Austro-Hungarian Army. The main focus is or course on the 70 years of Franz Joseph's reign. The book deals with the military as well as the political/ethnic problems which the army faced during these years. And also the technological problems the army faced trying to stay current with other great powers while at the same time clinging steadfastly to traditions and practices which were becoming not only obsolescent but a detriment to the sound functioning of the army. All in all a very good book. I highly recommend it.
I did not think I would like this book - but it turned out to be surprisingly excellent. It is an excellent history of the politics and social movements for the period. Anyone one who considers them self to be a student of Prussian or German history should read this book. It is a scholarly work - not a popular history. If you take the time to read it you will learn some things.
This is an excellent account of the diplomacy conducted by both Germany and Austro-Hungary in the Balkans during the period 1914 to 1917.  There are three main themes; 1) the effort to induce Turkey to join the Central Powers, 2) the effort to get Bulgaria to join the Central Powers, and 3) the effort to get Romania at first to join and later to remain a neutral. Underlying these three areas is the conflict between the two powers goals in the region. The book is a first class piece of scholarship and ranks alongside Langer's work European Alliances and Alignments in my opinion.
Very Poor - that is the only way I can describe this book. There is no scholarship at all. This is just a bad book.
This three volume biography (this is vol II) on Bismarck is the definitive work on the man. Pflanze is unsurpassed by other lesser biographers on this subject. If you want to learn about Bismarck these three volumes are what to read.
This book is the classic work on diplomatic affairs for the time period 1871 to 1890. This period is the height of Bismarck's balancing act. The formation of the Dual Alliance and the Re-Insurance Treaty. The Congress of Berlin.  It is also the period of French \\"revanche\\" which saw the beginning of the Franco-Russian alliance which would contribute to the tensions leading to WW I.  This books addresses all these events and much, much more. Anyone interested in the history of the events which contributed to the First World War should read this book.
This is a really excellent one volume history of the House of Hohenzollern. It may be hard to find, but if this is an area of interest for you, it will be worth the effort to get this book. If you are interested in Prussian or German history you should find this book and read it. It describes how a house of \\"Warrior Kings\\" in the 1700's degraded to a house of \\"want-to-be warriors\\" by the time of the First World War. It is well written and an enjoyable read - for a first class history of the House of Hohenzollern what more could you ask for.
This three volume biography (this is vol III)on Bismarck is the definitive work on the man. Pflanze is unsurpassed by other lesser biographers on this subject. If you want to learn about Bismarck these three volumes are what to read.
This work of Craig's is the definitive one volume history for the Prussian Army. You can read lots of books about the different Prussian wars or Prussian history - but they will ALL list this book in the bibliography. So do yourself a favor and read this first. <br /> <br />
I read this book because I hoped I might learn something. What a disappointment. This book is really light weight and totally speculative. If you have any REAL Scientific interest in extraterrestrial life, do yourself a favor and skip this book.  <br /> <br />If you are a pansy light weight on the subject extraterrestrial life you will love it. <br />
Pflanze is unsurpassed by any other historians this subject. If you want to learn about Bismarck his volumes are what to read.
Craig is an excellent historian - but this work is not up to his usual standard. More of a casual history of the \\"political\\" end of Pussia. A slim volume, thankfully, which is its main recommendation.
This book shows the Neo-Con agenda to be the bankrupt policy that it truly is - a 21st Century fable of the \\"Emperor's New Clothes.\\" Except people - American GI's, Iraqis and Afghans - are dying because of this fable.  For anyone who wants to understand this administration's foreign policy - and just how it has been hi-jacked - this is the book! This is a concise recording of ideology over reality. The facts be damned. The ideological agenda is what is important - not the reality of the facts. \\"Damn the torpedoes - Full speed ahead.\\" (And after all, those of us in Washington and Academia who espouse this theory aren't the ones who must do the bleeding and dying. We have others to do that for us.) <br /> <br />I think a few excerpts from the book explain our current foreign policy - and the reasons for the war in Iraq. A basic tenet of the Neo-Con movement is American Supremacy - military and other. Hence there is no need to be bothered with other nations or their interests. This is the famous \\"Unipolar Moment\\" which is now an \\"Era.\\" This is the reason we need \\"no entangling alliances.\\" <br /> <br />\\"Having, as we have shown, more or less abandoned international cooperation as a means of achieving American objectives, having an almost religious belief in military power, and living by a historically anomalous selfish interpretation of American leadership, Neo-conservatives prefer to go it alone.\\"  (pg 272) <br /> <br />On page 281 is a quote from a historical figure which is very apropos -  <br /> <br />\\"As soon as men decide that all means are permitted to fight an evil then the good becomes indistinguishable from the evil they set out to destroy\\" - John Locke. (pg 281) <br /> <br />We have very much come to this with the new permissiveness for the \\"invasion of privacy\\" under the PATRIOT and other laws put forward by this administration.  <br /> <br />And most clear and concise of all is this Clausewitzian statement found on pg. 282, \\"Terrorism neither occurs in a vacuum nor is it generally a product of outside agitation or ideologies. Rather terror can be seen to follow Clausewitz's dictum as politics by other means. Placed in a political context, there can be no military conclusion to a counterterrorist campaign.\\" (pg 282)  Witness Algeria, witness Viet Nam, witness Northern Ireland, witness Basque Spain, and witness Iraq to come.  <br /> <br />Neo-Conservatism is a bankrupt policy of military aggression and suppression. It can be explained to Iraqi's as \\"This is what is best for you.\\" Is it no surprise that they reject it - and that our \\"allies\\" such as France, Germany, Korea and many others reject it also.  <br /> <br />The book is a real eye opener. You should not miss it if America's future is something important to you. <br />
OK, I am in the obvious minority with this review, but it's how I see it. <br />This is a work filled with broad, sweeping suppositions, yet it seems that as always the devil is in the details and I was left unconvinced that the authors really had the details right to support their \\"Rare Earth\\" theory.  It is an interesting, if ultimately unconvincing book. Interesting theory, lots of conjecture, and lots of \\"What if...\\" in every chapter.  <br />To me it seems that in many places sweeping statements are made, but never supported. Take for instance the statement on page 110 \\"Changes in ocean chemistry caused by increased tectonic activity beginning a billion years ago facilitated the evolution of skeletons.\\"  But the section does not, to me, provide adequate support or explanation for this supposition. <br />Also take for example the Drake Equations which - while properly explained - is misstated in the details. <br />The equation is usually written:  N = R* x fp x ne x fl x fi x fc x L  where:<br />N = The number of civilizations in The Milky Way Galaxy whose electromagnetic emissions are detectable. <BR>R* =The rate of formation of stars suitable for the development of intelligent life. <BR>fp = The fraction of those stars with planetary systems. <BR>Ne = The number of planets, per solar system, with an environment suitable for life. <BR>fl = The fraction of suitable planets on which life actually appears. <BR>fi = The fraction of life bearing planets on which intelligent life emerges <BR>fc = The fraction of civilizations that develop a technology that releases detectable signs of their existence into space. <BR>L = The length of time such civilizations release detectable signals into space.<BR>(Source: Seti Institute, [...])<br />However, as given in the text of \\"Rare Earth\\" the formula is: <br />N* x fs x fp x ne x fi x fc x fl = N<br />This does not appear to be a big difference, however, the terms fi, fl, and fc are each mis-defined in the book.  fi is definedas planets where life does arise, not intelligent life; fc as planets on which intelligent life emerges, not civilizations that develop a technology; and fl as percentage of lifetime of a planet that civilizations release detectable signals into space, not planets with life.  This may seem nothing more then nit picking over details, but to me this is symptomatic of the entire work. If you can't even get a few simple 40 plus year old definitions right how accurate is the rest of the work? The belief that earth is the rarest of planets and then the selection of information to support that idea appears to be the main thrust here. <br />Good science uses data to take you to a logical, fact supported conclusion, you get the reverse when to select facts to support a preconceived conclusion. <br />Overall an unsatisfactory book.
This is the second book by James Kaler I have read. Prior to this I read his book Cosmic Clouds. A very good book, but this one on extreme stars is much better. If you like astronomy you owe it to yourself to read this book. I have never read such a full and comprehensive analysis of stellar evolution prior to this. Many other books treat star types as if they were like worms or dogs - one never evolves into the other. This book clearly ties together the progress of stars from one form to another. I can not recommend this book highly enough!
Hegemony is a popular buzz word in international politics these days. Talking heads throw it around every Sunday morning. So one might expect a book entitled After Hegemony to be discussion on American foreign policy \\"after hegemony.\\" In this case - Wrong!  This is a nearly 20 year old book with a title that is currently a trendy topic. And it deals with political economy and \\"regime\\" formation, such as international monetary regime, international trade regime, and international oil regime, how these regimes were founded during the time period the author considers the time of US economic (and military) hegemony (the 1950's and 60's) and how they evolved during the years after US hegemony had passed according to the author.<br />For students and academics who are interested in the political and economic theory of how organizations are created and evolve, how \\"rational actors\\" (governments) behave on the macro scale, how preponderance of power allows a nation to create regimes (that is rules sets) that favor its policies, how these regimes become self-perpetuating, this is the book. It is an academic analysis of the subjects.<br />If you are looking for something relating to the oft discussed current \\"American Hegemony\\" and its likely impact on US and world relations, this is not the book. Look on.
