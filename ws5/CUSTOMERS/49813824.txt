I've read all eight books in the &quot;As Dreamed by Itsy&quot; series to my 5 and 7 year olds. They're wonderful, all eight of them, so when you look at the others, you'll find this same review for all eight.<br />My kids  loved them and wanted to hear them over an over. I noticed that with each  reading, they comprehended a little more about the story. Even the first  reading they loved and picked up a lot of information from, but they were  so interested in the story to pay much attention to the concepts. After  all, they didn't view the story as a lesson in science. On later readings  they showed a great deal of interest and even awe at that the world really  operates in such ways.<br />And me - I'm not a scientist, am even afraid of  science, but this was easy. I picked up more from these stories than I  learned in high school. Of course the kids asked questions I couldn't  answer (but not too many), but they ask such questions every time we go to  the park or the supermarket. I just passed off their questions in the usual  way. Now when I someone says something about the Big Bang Theory, molecules  or such, I feel well enough informed that I no longer quickly change the  subject.<br />I recommend the books and hope the publisher adds more titles  soon.
