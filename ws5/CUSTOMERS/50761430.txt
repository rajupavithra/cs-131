Parallel lines never intersect, do they? <br /> <br />I have been a RHCP fan since Freaky Styley. I think that the CPs are the best band ever. Anthony Kiedis is someone I have always been drawn to and admire as an artist. I admire his lyricism and lifestyle... to a certain extent. This book tends to turn me away from AK as a person simply because he decided to co-author an autobiography that skips out on his spiritual nature, his self as an artist, and the sensitive and understanding part of his nature. Instead, he comes across as a 100% self-centered drug addict, with nothing other than sex on his mind. This book was really cool in the way that it described the origin and the creation of the band, and the trials and tribulations/efforts that went into making it all happen. But when you read the book, you get the sense that Whoever Whatsadilly who helped him write this, weeded-out the philosophical and deep nature of AK, and made it consumable for the average poo bear. I don't know AK. I have never met him. But I feel that through RHCP's songs and his lyrics, there is a whole 'nuther person that I do know, and that was purposefully kept behind the veil.  <br /> <br />I mean, come on... didn't his co-writer also write for Howard Stern, or something??? <br /> <br />Good read for any RHCP fan. <br /> <br />
I would like to re-write this book. It will be two pages. <br /> <br />page 1    <br /> <br />def: Interconnectedness: 1 : mutually joined or related &#60;interconnected highways&#62; &#60;interconnected political issues&#62; <br />2 : having internal connections between the parts or elements <br />- interconnectedness noun  <br /> <br />def: Causation:  1 a : the act or process of causing b : the act or agency which produces an effect <br />2 : CAUSALITY  <br /> <br /> <br />learn these definitions and apply to everything you experience. they are the two very principles that are beat into your brain by every turn of the page. they are also two concepts of Buddhism which Mr. Watts fails to mention by name, and on upon which he takes as his own and creates 159 pages of redundancy. <br /> <br /> <br />page 2 <br /> <br />&#34;Now come here baby and give me a kiss&#34; <br /> <br />How does one integrate girls and ladies and how they want to kiss you into a piece of spiritual literature? Answer: Ask Alan Watts. This guy uses the term &#34;I&#34; so many times that it can make one sick. <br /> <br /> <br />Mr. Watts is what may be considered a &#34;scholar&#34; or &#34;acedemic&#34;, but he lacks true understanding. He says it in so many words and by referencing others (because his ideas are not original, but recycled and stupified for the culture in which he was seeking as an audience) that to deny the ego is to actually identify the ego. And here he is calling his little ranting &#34;The Book&#34;. If you want to &#34;enlighten&#34; your self or enrich your life by undertanding and studying Buddhism or Zen, go directly to the monks who live this as a true reality. Don't buy into Hipster Chicanery.  <br /> <br />Chicanery <br /> <br />def: 1 : deception by artful subterfuge or sophistry : TRICKERY <br />2 : a piece of sharp practice (as at law) : TRICK  <br /> <br />
alright! if you haven't read Tom Robbins before, don't make this your first one. it is really a wonderful book but his others are more thorough and enlightening. Suggestion: read many other Tom Robbins books until this one turns-up at a resale bookstore or until it is released as a paperback.<br />that's it kiddos...
yes, i give it 3 stars. this is odd because it's the lowest i've ever rated a book. i think. the book was wonderful but it just took Rushdie so darn long to bring it together. and even when this was accomplished (in the last 150 pages of 520), it was a bit anticlimactic. very vivid ending to the story but i just think that you might pick up 'the moors last sigh' before you pick this one up.
This book could very well 'enlighten' you to be very careful of those in which you put your faith in. This guy is/was very lacking in compassion and love. You read his words and get the same feeling that I associate with someone telling you as a child that there is no Santa Claus. I get it that he's trying to break the conformist in you, but *Example* telling you that parents don't really love their children, they are just scared of what will happen to themselves if something happens to their child, is flat-out freaking rediculous. <br />Krishnamurti picks apart questions asked at the end of every chapter and basically answers the audience's question in the form of another question, hence, creating confusion and indirectness. I think there are many better teachers out there who can lead you in a more positive/productive direction..  Try His Holiness the Dalai Lama or Thich Nhat Hanh.<br />Thanks for playing Krishna-murky.
Most everyone who takes their literature seriously (most, mind you) will agree that this is a cornerstone to all that is metaphoric, lyrical and insanely intelligent.? Without giving away the plot, etc., I can simply encourage you to wade through the beginning 25 pages or so and then observe Joyce's development as a promising poet and literary architect. There is much skepticism about whether or not the entire account is accurate, but who the heck cares?- or for that matter, who could recollect their entire youth with such vivid detail? This book is well-worth your time to read regardless of your religious affiliation (Joyce was raised an Irish-Roman Catholic) and I would dissuade anyone who might question the book's integrity due to the time and place in which the story occurs- because, as you'll realize, the heart of the content lies in the protagonist's conscious mind.
I just think this work is a great starting point for folks who are ready for CHANGE. Here's a thought provoked by this book's lesson... Since man was not even man (yet), we have battled one another. We have separated into two tribes as Quinn labels, the &quot;leavers&quot; and &quot;takers&quot;. We need to remove the veil that makes us believe that there was a time where all was fair and groovy. The HISTORY of man will tell you that this is the biggest illusion created by men who contort facts and sell-out living a good life here on earth for a redemption when we hit the dirt. WhoooaaH. This is a great book to read so you have some FACTS and HISTORY to rely upon when spreading the GOOD word to others. Read it and then read some more of it. <br />Peace,<BR>Karmasoda

I have found tremendous joy in training and raising my Lab pup! I have read Water Dog and Family Dog (and watched the Gun Dog Video) and have found all to be excellent training manuals. What is most interesting to me is that really,  the trainer is the one doing the most learning... the learning comes natural to the dog. So essentially, the books are teaching YOU how to most effectively work with your companion. Most everyone will ask me when I'll take my pup to school... I tell them that I most likely will not have to because Wolters' books (and many other resources) have taught me that training is simply a matter of devotion to the dog. It does take time and effort but no more than that which is necessary (recommended in this book 10-15 minutes a day, gradually increasing time as the pup grows older) to have a disciplined, happy member of the family. Oh yes, and the training done in this book is by Wolters' 6 year old daughter which illustrates his point in just how elementary the training can be.
Like many Americans and readers who have written reviews of this work, I was also raised in a Christian home. It is easy to see that there is a bridge which most Christians are afraid to cross... that is the bridge to understanding, or more specifically, the way to compassion and understanding of our connection with ALL life and even those people within our own community (Sangha)! The message is that both Christ and the Buddha gathered quite a faithful following (millions strong and counting...) and that following was based upon love, unity and compassion for our fellow man. We should be forever grateful for their teachings. Niether man as he walked the earth was judgemental of others. Jesus and the Buddha befriended prostitutes and monks alike! Their love was for everyone and not biased. They spoke of peace the ease of suffering. They preached how love and compassion can ease the pain that we all encounter just by default of our birth. And when Christ and the Buddha's words were manipulated by those who truly didn't and don't understand them, the message is lost! Thus, we must make every effort in our lives that of which is worthy of the love and deeds performed Christ and the Buddha.
My review is not intended to be of the anti-psychedelic nature nor is it to take a contrary stance to those who are into the psychedelic arena. I also do not wish to disrespect a man who has a following and who is deceased. I bought this book because it was recommended here at Amazon and was said to be similar to the writings of Tom Robbins. Aside from Robbins writing the intro, their being generally from the same era and given their interest in the rebirth of the Goddess (of which Robbins seems to be more intact), there really is a thin association between the two. I would say that Robbins is definitely more enjoyable and enlightening to read and certainly more creative. McKenna's work seems to be quite a bit more technical, scientific and complex. If this is where you're at, you probably will enjoy it! The one thing that I might advise to a potential reader is that if you are looking for a book that will benefit you as a guide to higher consciousness (outside of a mushroom munching or a smokable trip), look elsewhere. In my opinion this book doesn't come close to others that work at constructing the psyche and our general relations to the earth and our fellow man/womankind. It is basically one man's detailed account of tripping without respect to nature or the fact that we are humans existing in a very real, physical world. The fact that shamanism is included in this book could be a little misleading, considering there is more to magic and healing than getting high. Just like MOM used to say... \\"Do you really need to get high to have a good time?\\"
Yes, as you may have read in other reviews, this one is about longevity. It has great insight and philosophy regarding the evolution of the human brain and its flowering potential. Wow! Uh, without going on too much about the plot, consider the fact that although TR is known to challenge our inherited conventional perceptions, he just might be the Rare Existential Optimist. Jitterbug Perfume is simply another novel that makes you laugh out loud, stir-up those colorful dreams and lighten-up!<br />Erleichida!<BR>Karmasoda
Having been a student of Jungian Psychology, Ziegler stresses the importance of the subconcious and its perfect refelction that we can view by means of introspection, moreso with the use of our THOTH deck (hence, the title). Mirror of the Soul has layouts varying from standard Celtic Cross to chakra-balancing layouts, to layouts for personal relationship readings. Pretty cool. There are  interpretations for each card and as kind of a bonus, Ziegler provides suggestions as to what questions you might want to ask yourself in regard to your readings, etc... <br />Some THOTH readers have the opinion that this book is too 'uppidy' and therefore not realistic enough... In reality's defense, Methinks we sleep in the bed we make.<br />Karmasoda
Funny... yeah. Intelligent... most definitely. Incredible metaphor and zany thought... you bet.   Kooky.... Tom Robbins. But most importantly... (Q) does this book bring you back to your roots and confirm that which you have always been certain of about modern society and mankind's havoc??? (A) Did an extremely stoned, blues-laden, harmonica-playin' Tarzan teach ole Jesus a lesson while he was meditating in the desert? Find out fer yerself.
A great biography of a young man living his life in the mirror of his beliefs. Fueled by the need to become his own man and by works of earthly-existential writers such as Tolstoy and Thoreau (to name a few), McCandless is poetry in motion. I think that what we see is a rare human being with his sights set far beyond where many will dare to explore. Any critical stance against McCandless' decision to live his life in the way in which he chose to live is, in actuality, jealous of an achievement that most fall short of... self-actualization. I would have been proud to known and walked with such a man. My regards to those left behind, but we all must admire the light in which he shed upon not only those who knew him, but those who will read of his life.<br />Peace!
This very well can be described as Miller's ode to the earth and mankind... the men and women who have occupied the island of Greece and the surrounding Greek islands since creation. It is a metaphorically beautiful work which stokes passion in the mind and heart of the reader and can be quite exhillarating in its degree of adventure. Writing an essay or critique about the phenomenal nature of this work could not even possibly do it justice. Read for yourself and allow its magic to mesmerize you and build upon your insight to your relationship to fellow man and the joy of being alive!
Man, to keep it simple, this book explains so much about life in the sense that in order to truly appreciate the gifts of the earth the psyche and the cosmos, we need to prepare. Castaneda goes through the tutlage of Don Juan, a Yaqui shaman or brujo, who explains the secrets of existence, lifeform, dreaming and reality. Moreso, the connectedness of our thoughts and limitations of reality... Deciphering illusion and putting it to use as a power or ally. This book contains imagery unparalleled and will change you as a person. If you are into shamanism, healing or magick (or just want a good read), pick this up and enjoy! <br />Peace, Bryno
This is a very short read but so intriguing that you will lust for the last few words so you may complete the mission. Henry Miller nurtures a childhood fantasy of becoming a clown and uses this vehicle to convey a perspective on life that you will find invaluable. Though short and full of entertaining imagery, the complexity and the symbolism (along with the epilogue) will blow your mind. Godspeed, Mr. Miller!
This work, much like his others, is comforting and enlightening. His Holiness has such a disarming and realistic view of the world and the way in which we should relate to others. Being part of the Western World and a capitalistic society, we can all use a little love, compassion and confirmation of our true interrelatedness with other people and creatures around us. Without bias and speaking from the heart, His Holiness the Dalai Lama encourages us to shed the skin of bigotry and learned hatred and tap into the core of our compassionate heart. Believing in yourself and your own thoughts instead of what is engrained into our subconcious and ruling mental compartments is crucial (and not superficial or cheesy) if we are to truly make a change in the world. Love comes back to the giver tenfold.<br />Peace,<br />Brynosaurus
The other review on this page is very accurate... This book will not convert you or make you aware of all that a shaman is or needs to be, but it will awaken you. There is a line that assists you in questioning whether you have what it takes to be a shaman and Lawson replies in effect.. you wouldn't be reading this book if you thought otherwise. <br />Peace and Goodwill to You!
Clairadon is unique in its genre of metaphysically and spiritually enlightening books in the way that it contacts the reader in a intimate way. What I mean to say is that many times you may pick-up a book that boasts the ego of the writer who leads you to believe that he or she may be one of the gifted ones to make contact with the heavens or divinity, leaving the reader to feel as though it may not be attainable to them or this self-understanding only can happen in a work of fiction. After a while, the bragging may get to you and you may find that the author is simply writing for his own gain... or chance at his storytelling. George Marcus seems to have incorporated many different philosophies (Eastern and Western and George Harrison's &quot;within you and without you&quot; , if you will) into Clairadon and what the reader will begin to see is the true nature of self, not excluding the suffering and doubt that arises on any spiritual journey. As we are all human and vulnerable, Clairadon's main character Joshua is you... is me... is a mediator between the content of the story and the reader. The journey that Joshua takes is upon a mystical ship that sails into other lands to discover the connectedness and reality of our actions, beliefs and realizations. My opinion is that Clairadon is a book that you should read at your own pace, absorbing the meaningful content within. This is a journey of humanity, moreover, faith and spirit.
This novel is without a doubt a classic, grizzly account of manhood and survival, transformation and change. Perhaps if you are one who believes that the spirit of the bear resides inside of you, pick this book up and read it all the way through. It is a magnificent story full of gritty, earthly imagery that will thicken your skin. From gunfights to hemp-laiden philosophy, from sensitivity to utter insanity... Stand up and play the hand god has dealt. Play fair but play to win. <br />Where's the sequel, Jones?
The Alchemist is a wonderful fable (if I may call it that) on following your dreams without fear or hesitance. When you come to think of it, life really is that simple if you just believe and persevere. Coehlo's imagery is vivid and magical.
