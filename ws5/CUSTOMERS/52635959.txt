Hanson presents an engaging and highly readable portrait of the landscape of Gen-X filmmakers, replete with observations that will make you want to pop some of your favorite DVDs into the player with a newfound appreciation.
This set is a decent value. For your money, you get a fairly broad range of phrases and vocabulary. However, the organization of information assumes that you can keep interest listening to a bunch of discrete phrases repeated one after the other with no conversations or anything remotely natural. If you can, in fact, maintain interest while listening to these tapes repeatedly, then you'll do well with this set. If, on the other hand, you need something more dynamic, you might do well to look elsewhere.

Fan of Steve Martin that I am, I'd hoped his fiction writing would be as enjoyable as his comedy. This is the first of his works I've read, so while it may not be representative, it does disappoint. Of course, if romantic fluff with a hefty dose of L.A. cultural critique is what you're after, you may not be disappointed at all.<br />As for me, I'll take L.A. Story on DVD over Shopgirl anyday.
