Since WizKids bought out the BattleTech/MechWarrior franchise from the now defunct FASA, they have pulled a number of surprises on me. The nastiest was going into the local bookstore, checking out the latest MechWarrior book, and seeing the date &quot;3132&quot; in the first chapter's header. I nearly passed out.<br />But after recovering from the shock, I picked up a copy of what was apparently the first novel in this new series (they need a better way to show what order they were in, although I had no trouble figuring it out from Amazon.com). Though initially skeptical-- I mean, I liked the old era and its characters!-- I was not disappointed.<br />Ghost War is very different from previous BattleTech favorites of mine, but it is still BattleTech. The first major change is that it is told from a first-person perspective. This was vital to the story, I later came to understand, but still somewhat of a shock. It is different stylistically (due to the entire story being colored by the perceptions of the main character, Sam Donelly). And finally, the new era still threw me off a hundred pages into the book. But after the shock of the surface differences, it becomes clear that not only was the move sixty-five years into the future a good idea, but having Stackpole handle it was also a good move.<br />The plot is twisting and convoluted, almost (but not quite) confusing at times. There is plenty of political intrigue and an element that has been a strong and important part of BattleTech, the concept that mankind will never cease to fight amongst themselves, is still preeminent. Stackpole handles the introduction of the new time period very well, and the main character, Sam Donelly, is well-constructed and entertaining. The use of humor through Sam's eyes is very well done also. Finally, the appearance (I won't call it cameo because I have a feeling he will be back) by none other than Victor Steiner-Davion was well appreciated and a good way to connect back to the old era.<br />If I had to complain, I would note that, like others have said, there is too little 'Mech action, but there is a reason for this (and there will be more action later on in the series). Also, Sam seems to be a little too perfect in some ways; it's not that he isn't flawed, but he is extremely versatile. Nonetheless I found myself rooting for him the whole time.<br />Another thing that bugs me is that Stackpole seemed to slip back into Star Wars at least once in the book, referencing a &quot;holdout blaster&quot; when the rest of the time they are &quot;holdout lasers&quot;. But this minor editorial issue can be forgiven.<br />Overall an intriguing and entertaining read. I'll certainly buy more in the series, and I am anxiously awaiting MechWarrior 5.
Star Wars. The Forever War. The Golden Age. Starship Troopers. Halo: The Fall of Reach.<br />What do these have in common? They are among the SF stories (or franchises) that have had the greatest impact on me. And I can say with certainty that Nylund's &quot;Fall of Reach&quot; was at the top of my list. Until Halo: First Strike.<br />I borrowed FoR from a friend. I read it 6 times before he made me give it back and buy my own copy (a decision I have not regretted yet). I then read it at least a dozen more times. It is the reason I am a Halo fan. It was that good.<br />When The Flood came out, I was both excited and dismayed- excited because there was more Halo for my insatiable mind to absorb, but disappointed because Nylund was not the author. (I have nothing against Dietz, but he needs to stick to books in universes of his own creation. He's too by-the-book for Halo, especially for a pre-established plot.) I read it and was inevitably disappointed- it was good, but by no means did it live up to FoR's legacy. <br />I was among the first to find out about the release of First Strike, and I was excited to hear that Nylund was writing it. I was also happy to hear that it would not take place as part of the plot of either game, but as its own unique story, which is part of what made FoR really shine. I had high hopes for this book.<br />I was not disappointed.<br />Halo: First Strike surpasses FoR in every conceivable way. The characterization is incredible, the action is mind-blowing, the plot twists stunning. It will answer questions about Halo you have not even thought of. It takes place between Halo and Halo 2, but goes deeper than even I could have imagined. And over it all, there are subtle hints that something bigger is going on. It is the same mysterious sense of majesty that made Halo so incredible. The atmosphere, the mood, the wonder of it-this is a book every Halo fan should read. But First Strike, like FoR, is not just for fanboys. It is not just the bestof the three Halo books, but it is among the best SF I have ever read. And I've read a whole freaking lot.<br />First Strike was satisfying in the same way FoR was: when I turned the last page, the only thing on my mind was \\"Wow.\\" Immediately followed by \\"I gotta read that again.\\" The only disappointing thing is that like its predecessor, it will be vastly under-publicized. As a serial paperback, it will receive no media attention, no appreciative comments by fellow authors printed on the back, no chance of becoming a hardcover. Just the fact that it is a video-game novel will prevent most people I know from picking it up. But none of that prevents First Strike from being one incredible piece of work. Even flawless. Nylund has an incredible gift, and I am truly inspired.<br />After I finish this review, and after finishing my third read, I'm going to go shove this book in the faces of everyone I know and scream \\"READ THIS!!!\\" Then I'm going to sit down and finish my own SF classic, which I will dedicate to Eric Nylund. And then... I'll read it a couple dozen more times.<br />It's just that good.
10,000 years into the future, mankind has perfected the very concept of existence. By placing the human body in a computer interface/cryostorage tank and assigning it an avatar (or &quot;mannequin&quot;) to freely roam the world, the mind of man can live forever without the restrictions of the human body. With the added abilities of a sense-filter, the human mind can discern between that which is desirable or undesirable to see or hear and literally turn off undesired content. In addition, artificial intelligence units, known as sophotechs, are commonplace in this futuristic utopia and some even have been assigned to govern over the affairs of men.<BR>It is in this paradise that Phaethon lives. The son of the ruler of the great noble house of Rhadaman, Phaethon is attending the great Millennial Celebration, the eve of the High Transcendence, when mankind became immortal. At this great party, he meets someone claiming to be an old friend, who tells him that he is literally not himself--that the goverment he trusts completely has taken several centuries of his life's memories and stored them. To have them replaced would be to exile himself from society. So Phaethon embarks on a quest to discern the truth-- a voyage to find himself. <br />Besides the intricate plot and fascinating detail, Wright's first novel displays several other elements worthy of note. First, the number of original SF concepts contained in the space of this novel is astounding. As an aspiring writer with some original ideas of my own, I can truly appreciate this. Second is the way Wright convinces you that his masterpiece creation is real. The level of detail is immense. Some would say the language tends to bog the average reader down through his use of terms unknown to the reader. This is, in fact, a sign of the inexperience of the reviewer. SF is unique in its use of descriptive terms; this is the only genre where you can throw around terms without explaining what they mean. Here's one just for the sake of throwing one around: his full name is Phaethon Prime Rhadamanth Humodified (augment) Uncomposed, Indepconciousness, Base Neuroformed, Silver-Gray Manorial Schola, Era 7043. Were Phaethon recalling his own name, he would not stop to explain what each term meant; neither does Wright. He leaves it for the reader to interpret, as a good SF writer should. <BR>All that as a note of caution: If you are not familiar with SF and the quirks of its authors, proceed with caution and much thought. You will enjoy it far more.<BR>I could go into more detail with this review, but I feel that would be excessive. Just go and buy the book and read it. But for heaven's sake, don't treat it lightly.
In such situations, it is customary to start out with a &quot;good and the bad&quot; scenario. So here goes. <BR>The good: This book has a complex plot that keeps you interested for the most part. The characters are believable (if somewhat twisted), and the setting is appropriate: a creepy old house in the Moors of England. Heathcliff is a maniac with a likeable streak (mostly it's just sympathy). Catherine is unbridled, wild and cruel. But it seems the narrator (Nelly) is a bit too perfect.<BR>The bad: The plot can be a little too complex at times, and it's hard to follow. And the first four chapters... don't even get me started.<br />I'm still giving it five stars because, in the end, it was worth the sometimes boring reading and slow pace. This book is definitely a classic that everyone should read.
