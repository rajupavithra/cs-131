I was introduced to English by this series in Hungary. A few years later, I used this material to teach kids and adults (!) with great success and I just purchased it for my nephew for his birthday-he LOVED it! I am quite familiar with language books and I speak several different languages now, but I've yet to find another publication with such an effective way of making people interested, love and master a language! It was fun, quick-learning without struggling. The material is so entertaining, mainly brief colorful comics, you get to learn about exciting topics and can't help wanting to read through the next page! The grammar is very well structured. I never had to try to memorize words or forms of verbs and still managed to start the process of becoming interested and then soaking knowledge in like a sponge. <BR>The series consists of three books guiding you through the world of this wonderful language, making you feel like learning is more of a pleasant walk in an exciting, adventurous land with joyful friends holding your hand. Each book is accompanied by a work- and a test book and two tapes with all the material included. A teacher's book is also available. It makes comprehending the language easier that the different projects in the books are presented by different nationalities speaking British, American or Australian English. <BR>(I can only hope that the first version will still be available in the future. Unfortunately they did a complete make-over )o: .) <br />Thank you, Tom Hutchinson, for enriching my life so greatly and enabling me to take part in doing the same for others! ((((o:

This block calendar has kept people around me entertained for the whole year. You can temper with it, it folds inside out and in several different shapes, folding back showing different months. It is also great as a calendar, takes up little space, looks good, and still shows no signs of wear.
The best entertainment. I have yet to see a compilation of everything I like in a book brought together like in her books. These are Sara Paretsky-like stories. You can't put them down.
