I recently bought this book for my nephew and he loved it! It has all the trappings a batman fanatic could ask for, molded into a child's activity book, which will capture any childs imagination. This book is an excellent  buy for someone looking to make a kid happy for hours. Peace.
This book is a must have for every U2 fan! It has detailed revelations into the bands beginings, and has full color pictures to compliment the driven narative! Even if you aren't a U2 fan, buy this book and you will  be. Peace
Ray Bradburt does it again! In Fever Dream, Ray Bradbruy spins an enchanting tale that reminds my of Little Nemo, about a boy who embarks on a quest through-dream land. The resulting work is nothing less than magical  and is not to be missied by anyone. If you are looking for a book you will  cherish forever, this is it! Peace.
Fahrenheit 451 is(next to 1984)truly one of the greatest literary visions of an overbearing, tyranical future. Its message is simple, genuine, and timeless. If you only buy one Ray Bradbury book, buy this one! Peace.
Bradbury is one of the greatest writers of our generation, and almost everyting he writes shows this. Death Has Lost its Charm for Me is no exception, the only difference being that instead of a collection of  stories, it is one extravagent tale, filled with joy and sorrow. Buy this  book now!  Peace.
Batman: Faces, is Matt Wagner's first attempt at a Batman story, and it is a decent one, however it lacks the punch of say The Dark Knight Returns, or The Long Halloween, however, Wagner's stunning artwork is what helps  Batman: Faces remain in the mind of the reader, long after the book is  finished. If you enjoy either Grendel of Batman, and are looking for  something to read, pick this up, and you'll be pleasantly surprised. Peace.
I first read Batman/Deadman: Death and Glory when I was still in high school, and I was impressed by the lavish artwork, but not by the story, it bearly mearsures up to any of the greater batman stories and alomst  diminshes the story into a laughable farce, if you're looking for a good  Batman story, please, look elsewhere! Peace
I am a huge fan of Lovecraft who himself was a fan of the true genuis; Poe. However Lovecraft has far exceeded the master in both sheer horror and prose, his stories are both terrifying and thought provoking. Anyone who is  unaware of the work of H.P. Lovecraft is missing out on one of life's  greatest joy's. Oh by the way, you must buy this book, Night Ocean only has  5 stories, but they are 5 of his his best. This book is a great way to  discover the master of terror. Peace.
Batman: Dark Knight Dynasty, is the story of Batman as a samurai warlord set in feudal Japan which may sound completely nonsensical at first, but once you realize that it is an Elseworlds title, it all falls into place.  This is an excellent story which pushes the boundaries of the comics art  form and virtually redefines batman as we know him. Buy this and you won't  be dissapointed. Peace.
Batman: Dark Joker, is one of the greatest Batman/Esleworld titles ever published, it is basically Batman set in a dark fantasy world, the art by Jim Kelly is without paralell. Buy this book now! Peace.
Batman: Anarky presents the Dark Knight's struggle against a foe who is just as driven an believies as Batman does that his personal crusade is a righteous one. When the two finally meet they realize that they aren't that  different after all, and end up joining forces to combat a greater evil.  All in all, an excellent book which every fan of Batman, or good comics  should own. Peace.
Batman: The Dark Knight Adventures is a pretty decent collection of some of the Batman stories featured in the monthly &quot;Legends of the Dark Knight&quot; comic serires. While none of the stories really stand out  there a still good enough to hold you're attention. If you're looking for a  good kick-back summer read, buy this and you won't be dissapointed. Peace.
If you own and love the original game, than you must buy this book. Not only does this guide enhache your enjoyment of this excellent game, but it also shows you every last secret! Buy Castlevania: The Official Hint Book  and dive in with both fangs bared! Peace.
Wow!  I first read this book after reading the Batman: Knightfall seires and boy, was I impressed! Not only does it complement the miniseries perfectly, but it also stands up well on it's own. It basically chronicles  the crimes of Bane after the Knightfall saga, and his final conflict with  the Dark Knight. Buy this book of your Batman collection will never be  complete! Peace.
I first read &quot;Masks&quot; one of the several stories featured in this excellent collection when I was a kid and it's haunting, dark imagery, has not ceased to entertain me. As well as the above mentioned story, Batman:  Dark Legends also has a tale about Batmans first encounter with the Joker,  which is one of the greatest Batman stories in print buy this book now,  you'll treasure it forever! Peace.
If there was a ever a book published which perfectly compliments Jethro Tull, this is it! From the roots as blues musicians struggling to survive in London, to their rise to glory, this book tells it all!
So speaks the bard, and so it is written. Pearl Jam is truly one of the greatest band of the 90's if not the century. This book helps give the band the honor they desevre buy going into detail on one of their first and  greatest albumbs; TEN. Buy this book, and you won't be dissapointed. Peace.
Is Led Zepplin the greatest band of all time? You bet! Is &quot;Staiway to Heaven&quot; their best biography? It comes damn close! As far as factoids and beautiful glossies, this book has it's bases covered. However in terms of looks, it could definetly use an overhaul. The cover is a bit garish and  not at all fitting to the title, which is a bit jarring, but nothing to  weep about. The insight it gives into the lives of Plant, Page and the rest  of the &quot;lads&quot; is extremely interesting, whether you're a fan or  not. And so if you love Led Zepplin buy this book, if not, buy it anyway  and you will soon be! Peace.
Alright!  Nothing else which claims to be a Renzor Biographycan even come close to this! In addition to the concert photo's andthe bizzare scribblings of Renzor himself, there is a 1 hour interviewCD where to put it bluntly, Trent lays bare his soul, in a way that only the dark master could be combing his dark genuis, rage, and intellect into a smouldering cauldron of death and despair. A must buy for any NIN fan and even if you aren't buy this, and you will be converted! Peace.
Yes! Finally a biography/photo collage, that does justice by Metallica. I picked this up a couple weeks ago because of an essay I had to write for a class of mine, and I was blown away! Metallica was the first band I ever saw live, and this truly captures the effect of the live experience.  Minus  the druken brawls, bonfires, and
Up the irons baby, Iron Maiden will never die! For all the initiated fans of the Lords of Metal this book is a must, and for those who aren't what is wrong with you, don't like heavy metal, if not I'll hunt you down and show you the error of your ways! Anyway enough of my ramblings, &quot;A Live  Dead One&quot; is an excellent companion to any Maiden album, and enriches  both your knowledge, and respect for one of the greatest bands in the  history of metal. This book chronicles the band's humble beginings in rural  Englad, as well as their triumphant rise to metal masters. If you consider  yourself a fan of great music first, buy either &quot;Live After  Death&quot;, or &quot;Piece of Mind&quot;, along with this book and you  will not be dissapointed. Peace.
To be quite honest, the only reason I picked up this book, was because of its cover which I happened to glance upon while searching through my school library. After I delved into it, I was pleasantly suprised. I though to myself, here was a book written in a slightly arciac style chronicling the  adolesence of a nearly forgotten writer that I could still relate to. I  suspect the only reason I found it interesting at all was because I like  the character in the story was still a young man myself. The way Joyce  anaylsizes the times he lives in, and gives philsophical insight, is trully  inspiring. I recommend this book to anyone who Irish or not, seek a clearer  understanding or themselves, and a glimpse into a now forgotten realm of  youth and mystery.
I bought this book expecting stories on par with those found in The Illustrated Man, and R is for Rocket, boy was I wrong! Now don't misunderstand me these stories weren't that bad its just that after reading  some of Bradbury's best stories, these just don't quite leave the same  impression on me as The Long Rain, and the Outsiders. Still this was a good  book to help fill my Bradbury collection. And so, here's my recommendation  to Mr and Mrs. John Q. Taxpayer, buy this book if you love Bradbury, if not  look elsewhere, and buy The Illustrated Man instead! Peace.
I bought this book on a whim, and man was I glad I did, it is superb! The book is split up into four different stories which all focus on I-Bots, the first examples of artificial intelligence. The first story begins by  chronicling the life of an American spy in WW2 Germany then rockets to the  near future, and leap frogs again to many points in bettwen. The book is  fully illustrated with wonderfull artwork, that trully matches Asimov's  genius. If you are at all interensted in robotics, or are just looking for  a good book to read, buy The History of I-Botics, you won't be  dissapointed. Peace.
Interesting, very intersting. If you have ever wondered what made J.R.R. Tolkien write his epic master piece, or are curious about what he was like growing up, this book is a must fo you. Of course being a biography it can  be a bit dull at times, but so what that how life is boy! This book afirmed  that the respect and admiration I have for J.R.R. Tolkein was not just me  blowing his importance out of proportion, for he truly always has, and  always will be, a master of fantasy!
