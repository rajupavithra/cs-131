This an excellent book.  Basically, the whole point of it is to mathematically define what a computer is and prove that it works.  The author does this by defining and manipulating mathematical alphabets and languages without resorting to any kind of advanced math.  Starting from nothing, the whole thing leads up to Turing Machines.  More specifically, according to the Preface, the goals of the book are:     \\"(1) to introduce a student of Computer Science to the need for and the working of mathematical proof; (2) to develop facility  with the concepts, notations, and techniques of the theories of Automata, Formal Languages, and Turing machines; and (3) to provide historical perspective on the creation of the computer with a profound understanding of some of its capabilities and limitations.\\"    The author did a wonderful job of it.  Plus, unlike almost all other computer/math books I've read, this book is almost enjoyable to read.  Again, as stated in the Preface:     \\"This book is written for students with no presumed background of any kind.  Every mathematical concept used is introduced from scratch.  Extensive examples and illustrations spell out everything in detail to avoid any possibility of confusion.\\"    Astonishingly, those are all true statements.  At a guess, I'd say that almost anyone interested in computers could get through this book without undue stress.  To make it more meaningful, I'd suggest (only suggest) prerequisites of having programmed a computer and knowing some discrete math.  From that point of view, it's odd that as of last year, this book was used in Florida State University's (FSU's) COT 4420: \\"Theory of Computation\\" course, which, obviously, is a 4000 level course requiring various prerequisites that put it out of the reach of all but senior (or graduate) level students.    Now, with all that glowing out of the way, there are a couple of small problems with the book.  The first is simply that the exercises don't have any solutions.  Forthe self-studyer, that's a bad thing.  In a school teaching environment, it's probably acceptable, though.  The second problem is that after getting through the book, I simply have to ask: \\"So what?  WHY should I learn this?\\"  Again, in the Preface, the author states:    \\"Leaving aside the obvious worth of knowledge for its own sake, the terminology, notations, and techniques of Computer Theory are necessary in the teaching of courses on computer design, Artificial Intelligence, the analysis of algorithms, and so forth.  Of all the programming skills undergraduate students learn, two of the most important are the abilities to recognize and manipulate context-free grammars and to understand the power of the recursive interaction of parts of a procedure.  Very little can be accomplished if each advanced course has to begin at the level of defining rules of production and derivations.\\"    But, in my experience, I have to say that except for one reference in one other book I've read, I've never seen any of this stuff used.  Even more, I've never known anyone who even knew of anyone who used (or even knew of) any of it.  EVERYTHING has been done at a much higher level of abstraction than alphabets, languages, and various levels of algorithms and machines up to Turing Machines.  I'm not saying that the material in this book isn't used SOMEWHERE.  But, I'd honestly have liked to have seen actual, specific, concrete cases:  they'd be fascinating.      So, factoring those two nits in, I rate this book at 4 stars out of 5.  If those two things don't bother you, then you could easily consider this a 5 star book.
This is the 11th in Pratchett's Discworld series.  Alternatively, it's the 2nd in the Death/Mort/Susan subseries (\\"Mort,\\" \\"Reaper Man,\\" \\"Soul Music,\\" \\"Hogfather,\\" and \\"Thief of Time\\").  It's an excellent continuation of the \\"fleshing\\" out of Death that Pratchett began with \\"Mort\\" (though \\"Mort\\" focused more on Death's apprentice).  Although a good chunk of this book could be considered as a part of the Wizards subseries, Death is really the main player here.  This is a highly enjoyable, very satisfying book to read.  I rate it at 5 stars out of 5.
This is an excellent, very readable history of cryptography.  It's very interesting to read, and requires no math or any special linguistic ability.  It nicely summarizes what cryptography is and what it's about.  I rate it at 5 stars out of 5.
First, the good part:  this book is an intellectual and academic masterpiece.  It would be great for people doing algorithm or other Computer Science research.  It's an amazing synthesis of much of the core of a Computer Science degree with Discrete Math and Probability.  Oddly, it's more like a math book than a CS book. <br /> <br />Now, the not so good part:  for implementers (i.e., programmers), this book is not all that useful.  The biggest technical negative is that, for the most part, the authors ignore memory hierarchies and treat everything as if it were running on a computer with infinite cache memory and having everything already loaded there.  Granted, the authors spend a huge chunk of time teaching the readers how to do (and prove) cost (or efficiency) analysis on algorithms.  So, readers should be able to figure out actual, real-world efficiencies on their own (although there's nothing in this book to illustrate how to modify the analysis to do that).  But, since memory hierarchies drastically change the relative efficiencies of algorithms, they should be considered in the original algorithmic analysis and ranking. <br /> <br />From a methodology point of view, another problem is that the authors assume the readers have full knowledge of the algorithms covered in the book.  In general, they don't even try to teach the actual algorithms, how they came about, the reasoning behind them, or any method of thought for coming up with other, similar, algorithms.  Instead, the authors merely focus on proving the correctness and cost of the pre-existing algorithms.  It's like the authors present a beautiful, theoretical, shiny structure sparkling and spinning in the ether.  They then explain what parts make up this structure, how they're put together, and how long it takes to use such a structure.  But, what would be far more useful is if the authors started from the more common position where someone has a problem and a big pile of parts.  They need to know howto determine the best thing to make from all those parts to fix the problem, and how to put it together in the most efficient way.  Essentially, it's the difference between a reference book and a teaching book. <br /> <br />On the level of irritations, the authors leave a LOT of core stuff as exercises for the student.  This is bad enough on its own (and is one of my pet peeves in the math world).  However, making this even worse is the fact that NONE of the exercises are answered.  So, firstly, that makes these exercises useless to self-studyers (i.e., me).  And, secondly, that makes the \\"proof is left as an exercise to the student\\" core parts of the book entirely inaccesible to self-studyers. <br /> <br />I can't emphasize enough that academically and intellectually, the scope and depth of this book is amazing.  If I were someone doing pure research in computer science algorithms, I'd rate it at 5 stars out of 5.  But, as a lowly nouveaux-programmer trying to improve my mind, the best I can give it is an OK 3 stars out of 5.
Overall, this is a very satisfying book to read.  It's a quasi-sequel to Bujold's \\"The Curse of Chalion\\" in that it the events happen after \\"Chalion\\" and there's a common character, but neither book really depends on the other (though I highly recommend reading \\"Chalion\\" first to get the most out of this book).  Even though I was very happy with it, this book does have some problems.  First, the main character matures an awful lot for the little experience she's getting.  It's satisfying, but you feel like there's a disconnect between the starting character and the ending one.  Second, the enemy in the book has a tendency to just appear whenever convenient to Bujold.  There's really no explanation (or possibility) for these multiple, massive incursions.  And finally, Bujold places all her emphasis on the personal level and almost none on the social or political levels.  Again, this leads to a comfortable romance novel, but the potential was there for a much more interesting book. <br /> <br />Overall, regardless of it's faults, this book is a light, comfortable read.  I give it a good 4 stars out of 5.
Though the main plotline (or two) of this massive book is somewhat interesting, Hamilton has just put too much extraneous stuff into it.  Specifically, he has too many characters, goes into far to much detail for much of what he describes and has several irrelevant plotlines running.  Admittedly, this is only the first book in the series (which is irritating in itself since there was no indication that this was a series until the cliff-hanger \\"ending\\"), so some of the \\"irrelevancies\\" might turn out to be crucial in the later book(s).  But, there's something wrong when it takes several hundred pages for him to cycle through his main characters' storylines just once and introduce them.  I spent a good portion of the book just trying to figure out if I already knew a character and what, if anything, he or she had to do with the story.  Also, without all the window-dressing, Hamilton probably could have fit the whole story into this one volume.  It's a shame, since the writing is good.  But, by the time I hit the last hundred pages, I was just skimming the text:  nothing was really happening to move the plot forward and after six or seven hundred pages, who needs more character development?  If the book were \\"lighter\\" (easier to read), I'd probably raise my rating a star.  But, as is, I'll have to give it just an OK 3 stars out of 5.
For years, I've suffered from the occasional bout of \\"try to figure out Linux\\" mania.  So, I've repeatedly downloaded and installed various flavors of the OS and tried to work with them for a while.  I invariably ended up throwing my hands up in despair because I couldn't find a Rosetta stone to decipher the Linux community's secret language and arcana.  Since the previous editions of this book seem to have good reviews and because this version comes with a DVD with the latest full Fedora Core 4 version of Linux (normally taking 4 CDs), I thought I'd give this book a try.  I'm very satisfied with it. <br /> <br />This book is everything you need to get started with Linux.  It has the DVD (plus a 2 CD smaller equivalent) with the OS and a huge selection of applications/utilities, honest-to-goodness simple English explanations of how to get started with Linux, and similar explanations of how to do more advanced activities (networking and various server-type things).  The key is that the author translates that previously mentioned arcana in reasonable steps that let the reader absorb the stuff without getting lost. <br /> <br />For those who are already past the initial \\"what's this Linux stuff anyway\\" stage, the book also seems to have all the information necessary to get various servers (Print Server, File Server, Mail Server, FTP Server, Web Server, LDAP Address Book Server, DHCP and NIS Server, MySQL Database Server, DNS Server, and Appletalk Server) up and running (that's beyond my needs and abilities, so I qualify that with \\"seems.\\").  If there's material that's missing from the book, it's not immediately apparent to me. <br /> <br />If you have any desire to try out Linux for the first time, or even if you're already experienced in Linux and want to learn advanced topics, I highly recommend this book.  I rate it at 4 stars out of 5.
If you're looking for a light book to read just to pass some time, this is a good candidate.  Nothing heavy here.  Outside of the utter improbability of the main premise, a completely spurious first chapter (with an introduced but unused character), and a miracle occuring to help resolve the plot, the book's decent.  I know that sounds a little odd, but it's true.  Plus, there's the added bonus of vocabulary improvement:  I've never seen so many multi-syllabic words in one book before.  I rate it at an adequate 3 stars out of 5.
I can't come up with anyone who should bother reading this book.  First, the authors don't really state who their audience is.  The closest they come is on the first page of the Preface where they say:    \\"...with the powerful and inexpensive computing tools currently available, we think that now is the right time to reconnect differential equations to its roots via an introductory course from a modeling perspective.  That is the goal of this text.\\"    Then, on page ix, they give a Chapter Dependency Chart which includes breakouts for Engineering students, Math/Physics students, Biology/Pre-Med students, and \\"A Course Emphasizing Systems.\\"  Regardless of the \\"Math/Physics\\" entry, above, the preponderance of evidence from the text itself leads to me believe that the intended audience is those who will apply differential equations (DEQs) in their jobs (i.e., non-Math-types) using computer models.  Of course, the fact that I have to synthesize (i.e., guess) the intended audience from various parts of the book instead of the authors just telling me is a strike against the book right there.    My guess as to the audience is supported, to some extent, by the way this book is written.  It seems to assume knowledge of various areas of physics, chemistry, engineering, and biology.  The point of the book doesn't seem to be to teach the understanding of the math underlying how to work with and solve DEQs.  Instead, it seems to be to teach some cookie-cutter steps to follow, perhaps using the \\"Lucky Guess Approach to Finding a Particular Solution\\"  (I'm not kidding), or if that fails, how to get the problem to a point where it can be entered into a \\"solver\\" and graphed.  I guess that's the \\"modeling perspective.\\"  The bigger problem is that the book doesn't even do a very good job of that.  First, the book seems to assume a pretty detailed knowledge of DEQs themselves.  Second, the authors skip huge swaths of how they solve their examples (I won't even talk about missing stepsin the few \\"proofs\\" they give).  One particular case keeps popping into my mind.  The authors spend a couple of lines translating the verbal problem into the DEQ, wave their hands and says \\"after some algebra,\\" and present a very-non-obvious solution equation which stretches across the entire page.  My guess is that the \\"some algebra\\" they skipped would take several pages of calculus and algebraic manipulation.  If non-math-types are the audience, I don't see how skipping ALL the math in examples will help them get to the answers.  And, finally, the authors also skip steps in telling the reader how to translate situations into the DEQs themselves.  For instance, when they introduce the Predator-Prey model, they give verbal descriptions of the \\"Laws\\" involved and present the reader with the DEQs.  After the fact, they generically talk about why the equations look this way, but they don't try to walk the readers through the process they used to come up with the DEQs.    So, in a nutshell, math-types should stay away from this book since it doesn't really seem to be a math book, and non-math-types should stay away from it because it skips too many steps and assumes too much.  I really can't even see the point of this book.  Perhaps if it were used as a companion to a manual in some kind of course in DEQ modeling (solver) SOFTWARE.  But, as is, I rate this book as just 1 star out of 5:  useless.
While in college almost 25 years ago, I vowed never again to read a book that talks about pulling balls from urns:  i.e., no more probability books.  But, since this book is used in a required course for a degree program I was reading through (Florida State University's (FSU's) STA 4442: \\"Introductory Probability I\\" course, required for their Computer Science degree), I decided to try the subject again. I should have listened to myself and stayed away.  I managed to get through the first four chapters before having to put the book away.  There are just too many assumptions of knowledge and leaps of logic over vast quantities of missing steps for me to work my way through the book on my own.  This is especially bad, since the Preface states:<br /><br />\\"This book is intended as an elementary introduction to the theory of probability for students in mathematics, statistics, engineering, and the sciences (including computer science, the social sciences and management science) who posses the prerequisite knowledge of elementary calculus.\\"<br /><br />The first use of that word, \\"elementary,\\" above, definitely doesn't belong there.  Also, I shudder to think of the reaction of people in the social and management sciences who end up in a course using this book.  On a more constructive note, I'd add to the prerequisites a *heavy* grounding in discrete math.<br /><br />To add a bit more information to the raw data of these reviews, I've mapped the universe of all possible readers of this book onto a set of x-y axes. Let the x-axis run from \\"non-Math-types\\" up through \\"Math-types.\\" Let they y-axis go from \\"non-geniuses\\" up through \\"geniuses:\\"<br /><br />- Quadrant I: genius Math-types.  This group, along with the Quadrant IIs, has a chance at getting something useful out of the book.  It's fairly evenly divided between theory and application, but I'd say the emphasis appears to lean slightly towards using probability theory over proving it (only slightly, mind you).  Everything, however, starts out with the theory and with proofs.  The problem is that the proofs are missing the majority of their steps and require quite a bit of mathematical knowledge and bashing one's head onto the table to get through.  Quadrant Is will probably have the least trouble with this.<br /><br />- Quadrant II: genius non-Math-types. Like the Quadrant Is, above, these people have a chance at getting something useful out of the book.  Though there is quite a bit of theory present, it's also coupled with quite a lot of applications via the examples (several for each theoretical blurb).  Since there are so many steps missing from both the proofs and the examples, those on the \\"genius\\" side of the coordinate system are the ones most likely to have a chance at forcing themselves through the material to actual understanding.<br /><br />- Quadrant III: non-genius non-Math-types (i.e., \\"normal\\" people). This group is going to have a lot of trouble with this book.  With a good professor or knowledgeable person nearby, they might be able to work through the assumptions and gaps in the material (with a lot of effort).  But, in general, this book is really not for them.  The large number of examples will help, but won't be sufficient.<br /><br />- Quadrant IV: non-genius Math-types. This group falls into the same boat as the Quadrant IIIs:  the book's not for them.  Though their math predilection might give them a moderate advantage in working out what the author is trying to do, they're still going to have trouble working through the proofs with all their missing steps.<br /><br />This book is really only suitable for either genius Math-, or genius non-Math-types.  I'd recommend that anyone who doesn't read through mathematics like fish swim through the sea avoid it.  With a professor handy to fill in the gaps the author leaves, the book might be acceptable to us mortals.  But, for those on their own, there's no way they'll get through.  Because of the mismatch between the audience the Preface lays out and the way the text is written, I rate this book at 3 stars out of 5., I rate this book at 3 stars out of 5.
This is the 29th in Pratchett's Discworld series.  It's also one of the standalone books (\\"Equal Rites,\\" \\"Pyramids,\\" \\"Moving Pictures,\\" \\"Small Gods,\\" \\"The Truth,\\" \\"Monstrous Regiment,\\" and \\"Going Postal\\").  As others have noted here, there's a definite trend in Pratchett's work away from the hilariously funny.  This is not necessarily a bad thing:  it's just different.  This work, like his other recent stuff, is humorous in a way, but is nowhere near as funny as what went on at the start of the series.  Mostly, the humor now lies in the mere existence of the parody of the real world and in the hyperbole he uses to establish that parody.  The plot and theme are actually quite dark (in this case, the villification of eeeeeevil big business, the glorification of old-time hackers, and, oddly, for Ankh-Morpork, the promotion of a government monopoly).      On it's own, this is a very good book.  However, those who've gone through all of his earlier works might still be expecting the younger, funnier Pratchett.  I think after all this time, we can wave that person goodbye.  What you see in this book is probably the kind of material we'll be getting for a good, long time.  I rate it at 4 stars out of 5.
This book tries to be too many things to too many people.  According to page xxiv of the Preface: <br /> <br />\\"In addition to an introductory database course, the book contains enough advanced material so that it can be used for the following courses: <br /> <br /> - An undergraduate or graduate course in transaction processing for students who have had an introductory course in databases <br /> - An advanced undergraduate or a first graduate course in databases for students who have had an introductory course in databases <br /> - A course in electronic commerce and Web sevices.\\" <br /> <br />The first half of this book is made up of the material from its \\"Introductory Version\\" brother (ASIN:0321228383).  The last half is the additional material to be used for the other courses listed above. <br /> <br />The problem is that the book reads more like a brain dump of everything the authors know about databases instead of like a textbook tying to teach some reasonable subsection to us ignorant masses.  More specifically, each section (and sometimes each chapter) should probably be an entire textbook in itself.  As an example, Chapter 15 talks about XML and Web Data.  It starts by talking about how data on web pages is semi-structured and how this can lead to problems getting that kind of data into a database.  It then introduces XML to the reader as a possible way to overcome this difficulty.  Then, the authors basically dump the entirety of the XML language's syntax and semantics on you (XML Elements and Database Objects, XML Attributes, Namespaces, Document Type Definitions, Inadequacy of DTDs as a Data Definition Language).  Since that section ends with the inadequacies of XML, the authors then go on to do the same thing with a revision of XML (XML Schema:  XML Schema and Namespaces, Simple Types, Complex Types, Putting It Together, Shortcuts:  Anonymous Types and Element References, Integrity Constraints).  Now that they've told us everything that we'd ever want to know about the data handling capabilities of XML and it's revisions, they go on to describe (in detail) the syntax and sematics of four different XML Query Languages (XPath:  A Lightweight XML Query Language, XSLT:  A Transformation Language for XML, XQuery:  A Full-Featured Query Language for XML, SQL/XML).  Mind you, this is ONE CHAPTER (almost 100 pages long).  Most authors would have treated this as a textbook (and course) in its own right.  But, this is just one of 26 similarly-written chapters in this book. <br /> <br />Also in the preface, the authors state that \\"rather than focusing on how to build a database management system (DBMS), our approach focuses on how to build applications that use such a system.  We believe that many more students will be implementing database applications than building DMBSs.\\"  That might be true.  But, since I started with only a light dusting of knowledge of the workings of DBMSs, and the first half of this book is supposed to be an \\"introductory database course, finding out how to build a DBMS would probably have taught me more about how they work than what the authors present. <br /> <br />At a more pedantic level, my next biggest gripe is with the amount, type, and degree of contextual references in the book.  There are tons of backward references to absolutely vital, detailed tables in the book.  Unless you have a phenomonal memory, there's no way you can get by without constantly paging back (in some cases, hundreds of pages) to see what the authors are talking about.  In the authors' defense, I can see why they did this:  the book is already almost 1,200 pages long.  If they had copied those tables to every place they reference them, this unwieldy tome would have been even larger.  But, worse than the backward references are the FORWARD references.  They're not as prevalent as the backward ones, but I can't come up with any real justification for them.  In many cases, the authors reference material that's several pagesahead of where they are.  It's not like the paragraph ends way up there and that's the first chance they get to include the material.  In several cases, they included the reference way past the end of the SECTION (not just paragraph) where they were talking about it.  Very irritating. <br /> <br />As an aside, Florida State University (FSU) uses this book in its COP 4710 course: \\"Theory and Structure of Databases.\\"  With a professor available to TEACH the material in the book, this book is probably acceptable.  But for the individual reader (like me), it's not very useful.  I rate this book as 2 stars out of 5.
From the 2nd paragraph of the preface, the authors:<br /><br />\\"...wrote this book as a text for an introductory course in operating systems at the junior or senior undergraduate level or at the first-year graduate level....  It provides a clear description of the concepts that underlie operating systems.  As prerequisites, we assume that the reader is familiar with basic data structures, computer organization, and a high-level language, such as C.\\"<br /><br />I'd say that's an excellent synopsis of this book.  It's not a book on how to use or how to program operating systems.  It's a book on the CONCEPTS underlying them.  It's not as difficult to get through, but it's somewhat like Patterson's & Hennessy's \\"Computer Organization and Design: The Hardware/Software Interface\\" &lt;ASIN:1558606041>.  Where that book looks at how computers work from the point of view of electrons whizzing by on the silicon, this book looks at how they work from the point of view of the operating system.  Personally, I'd put the target educational level at no lower than the senior undergraduate level just because it'd probably be very difficult for a junior to have the necessary prerequisites.  But, regardless, it's a well-written book that covers the topic decently.  I rate it at 4 stars out of 5.<br /><br />As an aside, Florida State University (FSU) uses this book in their COP 4610 course: \\"Operating Systems & Concurrent Programming.\\"
This is NOT a book on Unified Modeling Language (UML).  It's not a book on Object Constraint Language (OCL).  It's also not a book on Capability Maturity Models (CMM), Class-Responsibilities-Collaborators (CRC) cards, Decision Representation Language (DRL), Extreme Programming (XP), Gantt charts, Issue-Based Information Systems (IBIS), Joint Appication Design (JAD), Key Process Areas (KPA), the Liskov Substitution Principle, Model-View-Controller (MVC) architectural styles, Nonfunctional Requirements (NFR) Frameworks, Object Design Documents (ODD), PERT charts, the Questions-Options-Criteria (QOC) model, Requirements Analysis Documents (RAD), Royce's methodology, Software Configuration Management Plans (SCMP), System Design Documents (SDD), Software Project Management Plans (SPMP), the Unified Software Development Process, User Manuals, V-Models, Work Breakdown Structures (WBS), or any of the myriad other tools introduced in the book.    This IS a book to introduce newly-minted programmers to the kind of things, tools, and processes they can look forward to (with either anticipation or dread) in the real world of software development.  As the authors state on page viii of the Preface:    \\"We have observed that students are taught programming and software engineering techniques in isolation, often using small problems as examples.  As a result, they are able to solve well-defined problems efficiently, but are overwhelmed by the complexity of their first real development experience, when many different techniques and tools need to be used and different people need to collaborate.\\"    It's been many years since I was involved in major software development projects (and those were all in the military).  But, this book seems to have covered everything that all new programmers need to know so that they aren't simply lost when they enter their first software project.  The readers certainly won't be experts in the things covered, but they'll at least have a good grounding and be able to bootstrap themselves from there (especially since the authors provide \\"Further Readings\\" and a Bibliography at the end of each chapter).  For instance, on page 71, under Further Readings, they list three works on UML:  one of which is the 566 page official specification, \\"OMG Unified Modeling Language Specification.\\"    Overall, this is an excellent book for anyone who is just entering the software development world.  I rate it at 5 stars out of 5.    As a side note, Florida State University (FSU) uses this book in its COP 3331: \\"Object-Oriented Analysis and Design\\" course.
For a discrete math book, this one is pretty good (it's far better than the last one I read).  From the Preface on, the author states exactly what he's going to do (and why), does it, and then summarizes it.  This gives the book good structure and is an excellent teaching methodology.  There are oodles of examples and tons of exercises (odd numbers answered).  Each section has its own exercises as do the chapters themselves.  There are also more challenging \\"Supplementary Exercises\\" following the chapter exercises.  Right up front, the author states that \\"the book has been designed for students in computer science, electrical engineering, and mathematics as a one- or two-semester course in discrete mathematics at the sophomore/junior level.\\"  He got that exactly right.  To emphasize the applications orientation, he also provides \\"Computer Assignments\\" at the end of each chapter (and computer algorithmic examples within each chapter).  In what I consider to be an odd twist, he also includes a set of writing projects at the end of each chapter.    Unfortunately, there's one big negative to the book:  it contains a lot of errors.  These range from inconsequential typos through errors in mathematical definitions and proofs to wrong answers for exercises.  For instance, the first serious contextual error I found is on page 78:  the definitions of set union and intersection are wrong.  Both read \\"...x such that x is an element of A OR x is an element of B.\\"  Obviously, the intersection is supposed to be AND, but they both read OR.  Usually, these types of errors are easy to spot from the surrounding, correct, material.  For errors in exercises, the first several I found are:  Exercises 1.2, #63; Exercises 1.4, #21; Exercises 1.5, #37; Exercises 2.2, #15; Exercises 2.4, #33, #45, #47; Chapter 3 Review Exercises, #33, #37; and Chapter 5 Review Exercises, #5 (after this, I stopped keeping track).    To add a bit more information to the raw data of these reviews, I've mappedthe universe of all possible readers of this book onto a set of x-y axes. Let the x-axis run from \\"non-Math-types\\" up through \\"Math-types.\\" Let they y-axis go from \\"non-geniuses\\" up through \\"geniuses:\\"    - Quadrant I: genius Math-types.  This group will probably not appreciate the book.  It's definitely aimed at the application of discrete math instead of at the proving of it.  There are many proofs in the book, but there are also a lot missing.  There doesn't seem to be any pattern to this.  At a guess, I'd say that if a proof isn't easy, the author just leaves it out.  Regarding the intellectual level of the text, Quadrant Is might be OK with it.  Some of the material is fairly easy, but other parts are pretty challenging:  it's a good mix.  Overall, this group could probably get by with the book, they would just complain a lot :) .    - Quadrant II: genius non-Math-types.  The intellectual level of the book follows the same pattern for this group as for the Quadrant Is, above.  The application focus would please the Quadrant IIs more, though.  Like the Quadrant Is, the Quadrant IIs would probably find the book acceptable (probably a little more so than the Quadrant Is).    - Quadrant III: non-genius non-Math-types (i.e., \\"normal\\" people).  This is the group that should get the most out of the book.  The book is well-structured and complete and leads the reader through a reasonable sequence from basics to advanced topics.  For the most part, the author is careful to keep the intellectual and theoretical levels reasonable (though I'm still lost regarding Relations, Graphs, Digraphs, and Formal Languages and Finite-State Machines -- and his recurring motif of Fibonacci-related stuff is tough).  Assuming most people will use the book in a classroom setting, the errors in it shouldn't be a problem since the instructor should be able to point them out.    - Quadrant IV: non-genius Math-types.  This group can be lumped in with the Quadrant Is:  the intellectual level of the book isn't the problem -- it's the application orientation that would bother them.  Quadrant IVs could get by with the book, but would complain a bit.    Regardless of its errors, this is a pretty good book.  The potential audience covers the entire universe of readers with the best target being Quadrant III (\\"normal\\" people).  It's written well enough to be good for university use as well as for personal reading (mostly).  Without the number of errors, I would have given this a rating of 4 stars out of 5.  Because of them, I'm reducing my rating to 3 stars out of 5.
Because of physical problems with this book, the authors' programming style, and lack of a proper audience, I just can't recommend it.  There are just too many problems and too few positives for the book to be worthwhile.    First, the physical problems with the book:  in my case, the binding appears to be bad.  As I took it out of its plastic wrapping, I noticed a gap between the cover spine and the glued/sewn binding of the actual pages.  It looks like the glue that was supposed to hold the two parts of the book together failed.  Turning the pages causes a lot of snapping, crackling, and popping and I worry that the binding will break.  Second, it seems like the book uses too small a font (these old eyes don't focus like they used to).  Oddly, if I compare the font size to that in other textbooks, it looks comparable.  I'm not sure, but I think the publisher used a slightly smaller line spacing and either a lighter ink or darker paper.  Whatever it is, it makes reading the book a bit hard.  That's pretty subjective and minor, but more aggravating is that the publisher used an even lighter (gray) font for the code segments.  This makes the code even harder to read than the text.  Again, I'm not certain, but it also looks like the font in the code sections is even smaller than the font in the text.  And finally, the authors don't use any color in their code.  It's hard to distinguish the actual code from the comments.  This makes reading the code difficult.    Next, I highly disagree with the authors' coding style.  Essentially, I consider it sloppy.  In general, they don't write their class methods to ensure data integrity (and that's one of the big advantages of classes (which are at the core of this book)).  Also, the authors tend to directly access private class members within the class methods instead of using the class' already defined public methods that do the same thing (get/set).  I know this is allowed, but it's still bad software engineering:  you shouldre-use code wherever possible.  Similarly, and  worse, the authors violate the principles of data hiding by writing classes with public data members instead of with private data members and public get/set methods.  I also have a problem with the authors using \\"using namespace std;\\" in their code.  Since this exposes all of the C++ standard library methods to the program, it can lead to conflicts.  I understand that in a teaching environment this might be good for keeping the focus on the topic at hand instead of \\"cluttering up the code\\" with nuances, but the authors make no reference to this rationale.  They just blindly use that line in all their code.  I'd much prefer they explicitly did a \\"using std::whatever;\\" when they needed it.  What's especially bad is that they do this in all the HEADERS they provide for their examples (not just in the \\"main\\" programs).  Anyone who uses any of those headers automatically ends up with all the namespace names included in their code.  And, finally, not only are the authors lax in their object oriented programming, they're also lax in their structured programming:  they routinely, and without comment, use break statements to jump out of the infinite for-loops (which are feats in themselves) they set up to handle their file input.    Finally, and most importantly, the authors don't seem to have a grasp on who their audience is.  In the Preface and the start of the first chapter, they specifically state that the readers should already be familiar with objects and classes from a first course in C++.  They note that they aren't about to review old topics, but, instead, will pick up where that left off.  However, most of the book is a re-hashing of basic C++ programming.  For instance:    - Chapter 1 is a review of programming classes (and, thus, objects) in C++.    - Chapter 2 discusses 1) software design, 2) handling runtime errors, 3) object composition, and 4) operator overloading.    - Chapter 3 covers templates and recursion.The algorithms discussed are those usually presented in C++ programming courses:  selection sort, sequential search, binary search, tower of hanoi, and greatest common divisor.    - Chapter 5 goes over pointers, pointer arithmetic, dynamic memory allocation, constructors and destructors.    - Chapter 7, stacks.  Chapter 8, queues.  Chapter 9, linked lists.  Chapter 10, binary trees.  Chapter 13, inheritance and abstract classes.    All of this is what I consider to be basic C++ (see Deitel's \\"C++ How to Program\\" book to find references to all those things).  I just can't see how anyone could learn even the rudiments of C++ without having covered those topics.  I could be wrong (in which case, since I've provided my rationale for my rating, you'll at least know what to ignore in this review).  But, for all intents and purposes, the authors don't really start teaching anything new until after page 500 (Chapter 10) in a 1000 page (16 chapter) book.  And even there, I was so irritated with the various problems I noted above, that I kept wondering how much credence to put in the authors' presentation.    So, in a nutshell, because of the physical problems with the book itself, the sloppiness of the authors' programming style, and their mis-identification of the audience, I can't recommend this book.  I rate it at only 2 stars out of 5.    As a side note, at the time I bought this book, Florida State University (FSU) used it in their COP 4530: \\"Data Structures, Algorithms & Generic Programming\\" course.  They've now switched to  a book called \\"Data Structures & Algorithms in C++,\\" 3e, by Drozdek.  I don't know anything about that book, but based solely on this book, FSU did the right thing.
This book wasn't what I expected it to be.  I was expecting something from the point of view of being an Administrator and being shown what I needed to do, why I needed to do it, and how I would use Microsoft Windows Server 2003 to do it.  Instead, this book is written from the point of view of being an Administrator and being shown what Microsoft Windows Server 2003 can do and exactly how to do it.  For the most part, the book is descriptive instead of prescriptive.  Given that, the book does a very good job.  It's extremely detailed and covers a huge spectrum of what Microsoft Windows Server 2003 can do.  One odd thing is that even though the author assumes in-depth knowledge of the terminology and concepts of server administration, he also seems to assume that the reader has never seen a Microsoft Windows XP desktop.  He spends a good chunk of the book describing (in detail) things that anyone who has ever worked with XP already knows.    So, ignoring the fact that this book wasn't what I expected, overall, if you know what you're doing as an Administrator and just need to know how Microsoft Windows Server 2003 does the things you need to do, then I highly recommend this book.  I give it a rating of four stars out of five.    As a side note, this book is used in Florida State University's (FSU's) CIS 4407: \\"Computer and Network System Administration\\" course.
This book is probably 75% identical to the Deitels' \\"C How to Program\\" book (4th edition, like this book).  So, for a little more information, you might take a look at my review of that book here on Amazon.  The biggest differences between the books are: <br /> <br />- Even though most of the examples are the same, their implementations have been redone from a C perspective to a C++ perspective.  This is not a C book with C++ tacked on.  It's a C++ book that leverages examples from a C book.  If you hadn't read the other book, you'd never know the examples didn't originate for use in this book. <br />- This book includes an Elevator Simulation case study using the Unified Modeling Language (UML) to emphasize the object orientedness of C++ and to show the reader how to implement a fairly good-sized project in C++. <br />- Although the C version of the book also includes a C++ segment, this book gives a far more in-depth coverage and includes some things that aren't included there (the Standard Template Library comes to mind). <br /> <br />So, which book to choose?  If you're using these books for a class, there's no choice:  get the one the class requires.  If you're trying to learn C++ on your own from scratch, this book is the best choice.  If you don't know whether you should learn C or C++, this is also the book to get:  it's probably heresy to say, but if you know C++, you essentially know C.  If you're a pure C type, you might pick up the C version as an excellent reference and read the segments on C++ and Java included in that book.  Those segments are condensed enough that you shouldn't be bored going through them.  As with the C book, in the preface of this book, the Deitels state that the book is for everyone (beginners to experts) who want to learn the language. They've made a very good stab at that goal, but realistically, I'd have to say that those who are professional programmers in other languages will find this book too long for their needs. <br /> <br />A couple of additional notes.  First, the use of color in this book seems to be a recurring motif in the reviews here.  I was very pleased with the book's use of color.  As fully explained in the preface, all that color conveys information to the reader:  it's not there for decoration.  First, the code examples (and there are a lot of them) all have a light yellow background, so they are automatically offset from the rest of the text.  Then, the type within the coding segments uses other colors to mean certain things:  comments are in green, keywords are in dark blue, errors are in red, constants and literal values are in light blue, and all other code is in black.  Newly introduced code is also highlighted for emphasis.  This is very much in keeping with what various IDEs do to make code more readable (see any of Microsoft's Visual xxx products, the Eclipse Project Universal Tool Platform (specifically, the C/C++ Development Tools), and the Bloodshed Dev-C++ IDE).  Beyond that, the book also uses colors to emphasize the titles of the programming tips in the text (i.e., Good Programming Practices, Common Programming Errors, Performance Tips, Portability Tips, Software Engineering Observations, and Testing and Debugging Tips).  Again, all of this is an excellent way to convey more information to the reader and is not \\"distracting\\" in any way. <br /> <br />On an entirely different note, as an aside, this book is used in Florida State University's COP 3330: \\"Object-Oriented Programming\\" course. <br /> <br />Overall, this is a very good book. Experienced programmers might prefer something more terse, but all others will be pleased. I give it 4 stars out of 5.
This is a tough book to review.  On one hand, it's got an amazing amount of information in it.  On the other, it's got a lot of editing problems.  It also suffers from a lack of focus on who its audience is.  So, splitting the difference, I'm rating this book at 4 stars out of 5.    Regarding the book's audience, it's vital that you pay attention to the chart on page xiii of the Preface.  It maps your path through the book based on whether you're a software-type or a hardware-type.  Assuming I was so brilliant that I could ignore such trivia, I attempted to plow my way through the whole book.  Software-type that I am, I had some tough times in a couple of sections and then utterly failed to understand anything when I hit the core of Chapter 5.  If I had paid attention to that chart, I would have known to skip that part of the book.  However, even for the material that's within the path laid out for you by that chart, a lot of the work seems to assume knowledge on the part of the reader.  For instance:    - Chapter 2 is about the MIPS assembly language.  In the exercises, you're supposed to write various code snippets.  Many of these snippets assume far more familiarity with writing entire assembly programs than is presented.  - The exercises at the end of each chapter are broken into three types:  regular, \\"For More Practice,\\" and \\"In More Depth.\\"  Those last two types require far more knowledge than is presented.  It looks like the authors culled them from previous editions and, instead of trashing them, just stuck them on the CD and referenced them.  - Exercise 3.9 is annotated as requiring Section 3.2.  But, unless you're very familiar with the implementation of MIPS assembly language, there's no way that someone using the material in that section alone could do the problem.  - Exercise 3.13 is annotated as requiring Section 3.3.  Yet, the question is completely undoable unless you've at least read Appendix B. Of course, Appendix B, itself, is practically indecipherable unless you've had previous experience/knowledge with Logic Design.  - Exercises 7.21, 7.22 and 7.38 talk about \\"the first 1 million references in a trace of gcc.\\"  The book contains no definition of what that means.  Those questions also mention the cache simulator \\"dinero\\" and say, \\"see the Preface of this book for information on how to obtain them.\\" There's no such information in the Preface or on the CD.  The CD does have MipsIt software which includes a cache simulator, but it doesn't seem to work reliably on my XP SP2 system (it also doesn't seem to accept those \\"traces\\" as input).  That could be operator error, though.  Doing a Google search pointed me to max.stanford.edu as a source of the software and traces.  But, it seems you have to have a Linux system (or be smarter than me) to use them.  - Exercise 7.35 gives a C code snippet and asks you to calculate the expected cache miss rate.  There's nothing in the book about calculating expected miss rates from algorithms.  Also, the exercise is assigned partially against section 7.4.  Section 7.4 covers virtual memory, not caches.  - Most of the Chapter 8 exercises are mis-referenced (i.e., they're labeled as being associated with certain sections of the chapter which have nothing to do with the question).  Along with the standard problem of assuming knowledge that's not covered in the book, many of them teach new information instead of testing/re-enforcing comprehension of the provided material.    There are many incorrect page number and section number references in the book.  This is especially bad in the exercises where it becomes impossible to do certain ones since the code and data they're referencing isn't findable (at least easily).  This problem does seem to get better as you get to the later chapters.  There are also problems with basic typography.  Some examples:    - Exercise 3.29 wants the reader to come up with a non-restoring division algorithm based on the restoring division algorithm inFigure 3.11 on page 185.  The figure and page numbers are right, but the text of the question refers to \\"step 3b\\" and \\"restoring the Remainder\\" that aren't present there.  So, there's no way to figure out what the authors are doing or what they want the reader to do in the exercise.  - Many of the tables and diagrams in the book use \\"color\\" to help indicate something important.  Unfortunately, the color used is dark blue.  Unless you look very carefully, there's no difference between the regular text/line color (black) and the \\"emphasized\\" version.  - The text description of Figure 7.31 on page 544 mentions labeled sections that show differences in performance based on cache associativity.  The labels are missing.  - Exercise 7.45 gives you a C snippet that you're supposed to document.  It contains \\"!!\\" as an operator.  C has no such operator.  My guess is it's either a logical AND, \\"&&\\", or a logical OR, \\"||\\".    Also, the chapters are WAY too long and there are no exercises following the sections.  For instance, Chapter 2 is 100 pages long over 20 sections.  All the exercises (59 of them) are clumped together in the back of the chapter.  The authors note the necessary section numbers with these exercises, but each section needs its own set of exercises immediately following it.  This would also alleviate the problem where the authors have the wrong section numbers assigned to exercises.  If these exercises were at the end of a section instead of clumped with 60 other exercises at the back of the chapter, they'd stand out more if they didn't belong.    And, finally, the book needs answers to the questions.    As an aside, this book is used in Florida State University's (FSU) CDA 3101:  Computer Organization course.
My review for Pratchett's \\"A Hat Full of Sky\\" reads almost exactly like that for Pratchett's \\"Wee Free Men\\" (the prequel to this book).  First, and most importantly, I don't care what the \\"official\\" write-ups for this book say: this is not just a book for pre-pubescent youth. Outside of the fact that the protagonist is an 11-year old and some of the behavior/situations are somewhat simplified (i.e., it doesn't have the layers and layers of meaning buried in Pratchett's other works), this is standard Discworld fare. Some mild complaints are that the book appears to finish up just after the middle.  However, that was a faulty assumption on my part and I quickly saw what Pratchett intended.  Also, Granny Weatherwax isn't quite in character:  she's too warm.  I've marked the book down from five stars to four because of the mild simplification, but other than that, it's pretty darn good.
There are six books in Peter F. Hamilton's \\"Night's Dawn\\" series: <br /> <br />- \\"The Reality Dysfunction - Part 1: Emergence,\\" <br />- \\"The Reality Dysfunction - Part 2: Expansion,\\" <br />- \\"The Neutronium Alchemist - Part 1: Consolidation,\\" <br />- \\"The Neutronium Alchemist - Part 2: Conflict,\\" <br />- \\"The Naked God - Part 1: Flight,\\" and <br />- \\"The Naked God - Part 2: Faith.\\" <br /> <br />Be warned: you CANNOT read these books individually. They are, essentially, chapters in one whopping great book. If you like the first book, then you'll have to read the other five books in order. There's no tie-up of any sort between any of the books. The publisher just broke the story up because it totals over 3,000 pages. If you pick up a book before you've read all the previous books (in order), put it down. It won't mean anything to you. Since these books are entirely dependent on each other, I'm writing this review on the series as a whole, not on the individual books. <br /> <br />This is one of the greatest science fiction sagas written. It ranks up there with David Brin's \\"Uplift Saga.\\" It is literally a story of good vs evil and shows some of the potential (and pitfalls) of the human race. Over the years, I've read the whole series five times, and I still love it. I really only have two gripes with the book. First, and this is unavoidable in what Hamilton is doing, the evil in the series is definitely, graphically evil. This is not a book where the villain twists his mustache and laughs \\"nyah hah hah\\" as he forecloses on the orphanage or ties the heroine to the railroad tracks. The writing is fairly graphic in a lot of places. After five readings, this gets a bit wearing. My second gripe is one which somewhat limits the audience of the series (even more so than the evilness presented, and it's why I've given the series four stars instead of five): there's too much sex and the writing about it is too graphic. This is a problem with all of Hamilton's books, but it seems more prevalent in this series. Because of this, I wouldn't recommend the book for your children to read. But, as long as you're aware of that, I highly recommend the series and give it 4 stars out of five.

Without doubt, this is the worst textbook I've ever had the misfortune to encounter. Even before the actual text starts, there's a discrepancy which bodes ill. Specifically, the back cover says:    \\"Written for SELF-STUDY and course use, this book will suit a variety of INTRODUCTORY and more advanced security programs for students of computer science, engineering and related disciplines.\\"    However, the Preface states:    \\"This book grew out of my lecture notes for courses taught on a one-year POSTGRADUATE programme on information security.\\"    The back cover is false and the Preface is much closer to what you can expect in the book:  no person at a Computer Science/Computer Security introductory level will be able to get anything out of this book. The reader MUST already be fully knowledgeable about Unix, NT, Multics, and various computer security models and jargon. There's no way around that. If you don't meet those requirements, don't even think about picking up this book.    The biggest problem with the book is that it's written from the viewpoint of someone talking to a group of people who are already familiar with the subject:  the author is merely pointing out things that those already-knowledgeable people should know. Instead of writing to teach people the topic, the author just synthesizes his own knowledge to focus on the subject. Also, he uses words not to explain and enlighten, but to confuse and obfuscate. For instance, his standard writing behavior is to use obscure technical terms well before he defines them. Plus, in general, as the book progresses, the exercises at the end of each chapter have less and less to do with anything discussed in the book and require such a level of expertise in huge swaths of areas that no one could possibly do them. Some specifics:    - The first five chapters are devoted to some of the theoretical underpinnings of the theory of computer security. Unfortunately, the author doesn't really explain these models. Instead, he assumes intimate knowledge of the models and talks about certain aspects of them. What's really jarring is that after solely talking about motherhood and apple pie (security wise) in nice, warm, fuzzy terms, he suddenly drops in \\"equations\\" from these models without explaining any of the terms or nomenclature (he follows this procedure throughout the book). Usually, after several pages you can find the definitions for what he's just said. But, unless you're familiar with what he's doing, none of this will make sense.    - For icing, in these first five chapters, the author uses virtually NO examples (which, for the most part, continues throughout the book). He'll mention Multics and some consultant data base as sources, but he never gives concrete examples of what he's \\"explaining.\\" Even worse, with no examples in the text, the author asks the reader to provide examples of what he's talking about in the exercises. In general, the exercises assume far more knowledge than the author has provided in the text.    - In chapter 6, \\"Unix Security,\\" he moves into \\"examples\\" of where these models are used. Similarly to earlier chapters, he writes as though his readers are intimately familiar with the subject (Unix, in this case) and that he's merely pointing out some interesting things. The chapter is filled with Unix commands with no structure to his delivery or explanation of where those commands come from. Plus, when you get to the exercises at the end of the chapter, they're mostly of the type that require you to SIGN ON TO YOUR UNIX SYSTEM AND DO THINGS! There's nothing in the preface of this book stating the requirement for being on (and intimately familiar with) a Unix system. Yet, there you are, unable to understand the chapter, and unable to do the exercises.    - Chapter 7, \\"Windows NT Security,\\" is almost as bad. For someone with no familiarity with the inner workings of NT, most of the chapter will be meaningless. It's not quite as bad as Chapter 6 since NT uses a GUI for what he discusses and Unix uses the command line, but it's still frustrating. Unlike Chapter 6 and Unix, the exercises don't assume access to an NT machine, although most of them can't be done with only the information presented in the chapter.    - Chapter 8, \\"How Things Go Wrong,\\" is actually somewhat interesting. It suffers from the same assumption that the reader is intimately familiar with the technical jargon of various systems and protocols. But, it actually involves examples. Of course, the exercises at the end of the chapter are undoable since they don't relate to anything taught in the chapter and are at a highly technically adept level.    I'm running out of space, so I won't write about the remaining seven chapters except to say that they suffer from the same things related above. I'd also like to include some advice to Florida State University (FSU): this book is the text for an elective (CIS 4360: \\"Introduction to Computer Security\\") in their Computer Science degree. According to the course write-up, its sole prerequisite is CGS 3408, which is a C programming course. FSU seriously needs to re-examine their use of this book. There's no chance that undergraduate students with only a C programming course under their belts (and C is used nowhere in the book) will get anything out of this book other than hemorrhoids. Find another book.    I rate this book 1 star out of 5. Avoid.
There are six books in Peter F. Hamilton's \\"Night's Dawn\\" series: <br /> <br /> - \\"The Reality Dysfunction - Part 1:  Emergence,\\" <br /> - \\"The Reality Dysfunction - Part 2:  Expansion,\\" <br /> - \\"The Neutronium Alchemist - Part 1:  Consolidation,\\" <br /> - \\"The Neutronium Alchemist - Part 2:  Conflict,\\" <br /> - \\"The Naked God - Part 1:  Flight,\\" and  <br /> - \\"The Naked God - Part 2:  Faith.\\" <br /> <br />Be warned:  you CANNOT read these books individually.  They are, essentially, chapters in one whopping great book.  If you like the first book, then you'll have to read the other five books in order.  There's no tie-up of any sort between any of the books.    The publisher just broke the story up because it totals over 3,000 pages.  If you pick up a book before you've read all the previous books (in order), put it down.  It won't mean anything to you.  Since these books are entirely dependent on each other, I'm writing this review on the series as a whole, not on the individual books. <br /> <br />This is one of the greatest science fiction sagas written.  It ranks up there with David Brin's \\"Uplift Saga.\\"  It is literally a story of good vs evil and shows some of the potential (and pitfalls) of the human race.  Over the years, I've read the whole series five times, and I still love it.  I really only have two gripes with the book.  First, and this is unavoidable in what Hamilton is doing, the evil in the series is definitely, graphically evil.  This is not a book where the villain twists his mustache and laughs \\"nyah hah hah\\" as he forecloses on the orphanage or ties the heroine to the railroad tracks.  The writing is fairly graphic in a lot of places.  After five readings, this gets a bit wearing.  My second gripe is one which somewhat limits the audience of the series (even more so than the evilness presented, and it's why I've given the series four stars instead of five):  there's too much sex and the writing about it is too graphic.  This is a problem with all of Hamilton's books, but it seems more prevalent in this series.  Because of this, I wouldn't recommend the book for your children to read.  But, as long as you're aware of that, I highly recommend the series and give it 4 stars out of five.
Before you use this book, make sure you understand the author's purpose:  \\"Although the book is elementary in the level of mathematics required and in the statistical procedures presented, it aims to give students both an understanding of the main ideas of statistics and useful skills for working with data\\" (Preface, pp xiv-xv).  The key point here is \\"elementary in the level of mathematics required.\\"  Essentially, this is a math-lite version of statistics.  With that in mind, the author did a decent job of passing on a working knowledge of statistics (I'll bet all the math in the book could fit on one 5x8 card).  Also, the book has TONS of examples.  I'd say that at least half of the text is just the author working through real-world examples.  So, if you have trouble understanding the statistical concepts the author is trying to get across, there's sure to be plenty of examples immediately following his explanation to help you work things out. <br /> <br />To add a bit more information to the raw data of these reviews, I've mapped the universe of all possible readers of this book onto a set of x-y axes. Let the x-axis run from \\"non-Math-types\\" up through \\"Math-types.\\" Let they y-axis go from \\"non-geniuses\\" up through \\"geniuses:\\" <br /> <br />- Quadrant I: genius Math-types might as well not even pick this book up.  There's almost no math here, nothing is proven, and the example-to-meat ratio is darn near infinite. <br /> <br />- Quadrant II: genius non-Math-types, like the Quadrant Is, should also skip this book.  The application focus will please them, but that example-to-meat ratio I mentioned above will bore them to tears. <br /> <br />- Quadrant III: non-genius non-Math-types (i.e., \\"normal\\" people).  Normally, I consider this one group.  However, this book is probably at too simple a level for most of them.  The book essentially starts from the assumption that the reader has never used Excel or a calculator to put numbers into a table and graph them.  In thisday and age, most people will probably be familiar with this.  However, for those who aren't, or for those looking for an easy primer in statistics, this is the book for you.  Starting, essentially, from scratch, the author will move you up to an ability to understand and use statistics better than most people on the planet (nothing esoteric, just the core stuff).  About the only math you need is basic Algebra. <br /> <br />- Quadrant IV: non-genius Math-types, like the Quadrant Is and Quadrant IIs, should probably avoid this book.  There's just not enough math in it to satisfy their learning desires.  Plus, since they're Math-types, they will probably already know enough math to make what's in this book redundant. <br /> <br />Overall, this is a decent book (I rate it 4 stars out of 5). The author did a good job matching his material to his chosen audience (a subset of Quadrant IIIs). For anyone on the \\"genius\\" or \\"Math\\" side of my coordinate system, I highly recommend they AVOID this book.  For the majority of the Quadrant III (\\"normal\\") people, the lack of almost any math might make the book too simplistic.  But, for those with few math skills and little background in number manipulation or graphing, this is a very good start.
This book is used in FSU's CGS 3408 course: \\"Introduction to Programming with the C Language.\\"  In the preface, the Deitels state that this book is for everyone (beginners to experts) who want to learn C.  They've made a very good stab at that goal, but realistically, I'd have to say that those who are professional programmers in other languages will find this book too long for their needs.  For beginners (and even those moderately versed in other languages), this is an excellent book.  I really have only three minor gripes about it:      - First, throughout the C portion, the book uses scanf as the default for getting user input.  Unfortunately, as my compiler warned me constantly (and I verified on the web), scanf has been \\"deprecated\\" (I guess that's a fancy way to say don't use it, use something else).  Unfortunately, the book talks about alternative IO in only one chapter near the end of the C portion and very rarely uses it.  So, this book teaches as a standard an input method that's been superseded.      - Second, and related to the first, the book clumps all IO except for printf and scanf into a single chapter near the end.  It would have been a lot better if they had introduced alternative IO a little at a time throughout the book.  As it is, my eyes just glazed over when I hit that chapter.      - And, finally, though this might sound weird, there are too many exercises at the end of each chapter.  I read through this book on my own and so had no way of choosing which exercises to do.  Some of the chapters have over 40 programming exercises.  I suppose this is great at a college where the instructors can select different exercises for years without repeating.  But, as an individual, I'd have preferred a handful of in-depth exercises focusing on the chapter material instead of a huge number of varied exercises (some of which don't seem to have much bearing on the chapter).    One note about the content of this book:  most of it (over half) is dedicated to C.  It covers C in detail.  The remaining half is equally divided between C++ and Java.  The level of detail in those chapters (and the exercises, too) comes nowhere near that in the C portion.  If you're interested in C++ or Java, those chunks in this book are good, but you'll really need to read dedicated books to get the full treatment.    Overall, a very good book.  Experienced programmers might prefer something more terse, but all others will be pleased.  I give it 4 stars out of 5.
To add a bit more information to the raw data of these reviews, I've mapped the universe of all possible readers of this book onto a set of x-y axes. Let the x-axis run from \\"non-Math-types\\" up through \\"Math-types.\\" Let they y-axis go from \\"non-geniuses\\" up through \\"geniuses:\\"    - Quadrant I: genius Math-types will probably be both irritated and bored with this book.  Their irritation will spring from the fact that not all of the pure-math proofs they'll be looking for are here.  The book focuses more on explaining and doing calculus than on proving it.  Most of the material is proven (properly:  no missing steps), but the proofs that would get in the way of doing calculus are omitted.  Quadrant Is will be bored because the author does his best to pound on a topic until practically everyone can understand it.  Genius math-types, since they're inherently capable of grasping this material from proofs alone, will not be pleased by this repetition.  For Quadrant Is, some version of Tom M. Apostol's Calculus books (ISBNs 9686708103, 842915003X, 8429150013, 0471000051, 0471503037, 0471000078, or 0471000086) would be a better text.    - Quadrant II: genius non-Math-types will probably prefer the fact that the author skipped some proofs in favor of applications.  However, like the Quadrant Is, they'll probably be somewhat bored by the author's \\"slowness\\" in moving on after he introduces a topic.  This book will be OK for them, but they'd probably prefer a more \\"terse\\" presentation.  Unfortunately, I don't have any recommendations for such a book.    - Quadrant III: non-genius non-Math-types (i.e., \\"normal\\" people), will find this book just right.  As noted above, the author's focus is on teaching and using calculus, not *necessarily* on proving it.  If the proofs are complex enough that they'd distract from that mission, they're either relegated to Appendix G or omitted (though most proofs are present).  Best of all, the author doesn't skip steps in his proofs:  all the steps are there in their detailed glory.  Later in the book, he will occasionally skip a simplification of an expression, but none of the \\"proof\\" material is missing.  In the latter half of the book, he sometimes does the \\"proof is left as an exercise for the student\\" routine, but those are for non-essential proofs.  After the author introduces a topic/theorem/method, he always gives multiple (at least three) examples.  So, if the readers are having trouble with the equations and proofs,  they'll have several chances to figure out what he means from the examples.  Also, all the odd problems have answers in the back of the book.  There are no steps included with the answers, but usually that's not a problem (since there are so many examples in the book).  I also found the appendices giving explanations of pre-Calculus math facts very useful:  it's been a long time since I've seen those things, so I needed the refresher.    - Quadrant IV: non-genius Math-types will join the Quadrant Is in disliking the skipping of several proofs, but, like the Quadrant IIIs, will be pleased with the thorough, step-by-step nature of the existing proofs.  Not the best choice of a textbook for them, but for those who are having trouble with a \\"pure math\\" Calculus book, this is a good supplement.    Overall, this is an excellent book (I rate it 5 stars out of 5).  The author did a wonderful job matching his material to his chosen audience (Quadrant III, \\"normal\\" people).  For non-genius non-math-types, I highly recommend it.  For genius non-math-types and non-genius math-types, it's OK.  Genius math-types should avoid it and try something like Apostol's Calculus.
Ouch.  I definitely made a mistake trying this book.  From what I can see, the only set of people who might find this book useful would be genius non-Math-types.  My handy-dandy way of explaining this is by mapping the universe of all possible readers onto a set of x-y axes.  Let the x axis run from \\"non-Math-types\\" up through \\"Math-types.\\"  Let they y axis go from \\"non-geniuses\\" up through \\"geniuses:\\"      - Quadrant I:  if you're a genius Math-type, you'll be aghast at the lack of rigor in the proofs and at all the steps missing from the few proofs given.  But, you might be able to work through the material on your own.  My guess, though, is that you'll throw the book across the room in disgust, instead.      - Quadrant II:  if you're a genius non-Math-type, you might find the lack of rigor in the proofs tolerable.  Plus, you, like the Quadrant Is, might be able to work through the material enough so that you can follow the author's explanations.  If you're smart enough and have enough familiarity with the material before reading this book, you might find its terseness acceptable.      - Quadrant III:  if you're a non-genius non-Math-type (i.e., \\"normal\\"), you'll be lost.  You (we) won't understand what the point of this is, won't be able to work thru all the missing steps in the few proofs given, and will rant and rave when the authors \\"prove\\" one thing, give one example, and then ask the reader to prove the several follow-up theorems as an exercise.  With, essentially, one example to work from in a subset of each topic, you'll never be able to work through the few questions with answers (which answers are short to the point of worthlessness) and will throw up your hands in dismay when attempting to solve the non-answered end-of-chapter questions.      - Quadrant IV:  if you're a non-genius Math-type, you will join the Quadrant Is in horror at the lack of rigor, but, like the Quadrant IIIs, will be horribly frustrated since you won't be able to force your way through the material on your own.  A definite lose-lose situation, here.    The really odd thing with this book is that, in the universities, Discrete Math (the subject) is usually a required course for Computer Science majors and is a PRE-CALCULUS course.  There's absolutely no way that any such student at that point in his degree could get through this book.  I received my B.S. in Mathematics from the University of Michigan well over 20 years ago (so I've forgotten most everything, plus I was a Quadrant IV type but figured it out much later and migrated to Quadrant III), but there are entire chapters in this book where I only understand words like \\"the\\" and \\"and.\\"  The authors assume an extremely in-depth degree of mathematical knowledge on the part of the reader.  Also, there's nothing to tie the subject matter back to anything a CS person (or any non-math-type) could use in his degree, profession, or life.  So, once again, this book is very poorly matched against any intended audience.    I'd also like to point out that I doubt this book would ever be chosen by any academic institution for teaching.  It just doesn't follow the established norms on how to teach.  Specifically, it should:  1) tell the readers what it's going to say, 2) tell them, and 3) tell them what it just told them.  Each chapter and section in this book just starts out talking about something.  You really have no idea where the authors are going until they actually get there.  What the book really, REALLY needs is for the authors to state exactly what they're going to do in a section and chapter, do it, and then summarize it.  Ditto for the book as a whole.  The preface needs some kind of overall game plan so the people reading the book know where they're going.    Since the publisher hasn't provided the information on Amazon, I've put a scanned copy of the book's Table of Contents in the \\"User Images\\" area at the top of the page.    I rate this book 2 stars out of 5.
This book is one of the two texts in FSU's COP 3502: \\"Introduction to Computer Science\\" course (a required course in their Computer Science degree).  It's mostly a waste of time.  The first two chapters are of some use because they provide a brief history of computers and a quick introduction to the ethical theories one can use to resolve ethical dilemmas. Unfortunately, chapters 3 through 6 (inclusive) are worthless.  They consist of about 190 pages of figuring out why certain obviously wrong activities are wrong (things like sending spam, producing pornography, stealing intellectual property, violating privacy, stealing identities, producing viruses, etc.).  The last three chapters might have some merit, though.  They cover some of the more general ethical consideration of working in the computer science field.  Unfortunately, I stopped reading when the author started bringing up false POLITICAL references.    In general, most of the examples of ethical situations in these chapters are non-computer-related.  Since the author specifically talks about this book being an ethics course as adhering to the IEEE's and ACM's \\"Computing Curricula 2001\\" standard, its examples ought to be drawn from the Information Systems world.  My biggest gripe with these chapters is the obvious political slant of the author.  He's constantly slipping his world-view based assumptions into the text as absolute-truth.  I wonder what the ethics is of implying to students that certain things are true when, at best, they're controversial, and at worst, false?    I truthfully feel sorry for the poor students in FSU's Computer Science degree program who are stuck going through a course with this book and a (most probably) similarly slanted professor.    I give it 1 Star out of 5.
This book is one of the two texts in FSU's COP 3502: \\"Introduction to Computer Science\\" course (a required course in their Computer Science degree).  As the authors state in the preface, they \\"wanted to design a 'CS 0' course that was a true survey course.\\"  They did an excellent job.  Basically, they start with the assumption that the reader has never turned on a computer in his life and take him through its history, how to use it, what programming is about, and how the hardware works.  They even teach a bit of HTML and JavaScript.  There's very little I can say that is bad about the book.  It comes down to some typgraphical errors, an incorrect web address for the online portion of the book (easily figured out from the page their web address takes you to), and my belief that they took out too many steps in describing computer switches, gates, and circuits.  Frankly, I'm amazed that they reasonably went from a neophyte level to a fully-grounded level in one book.  I rate it as 5 stars out of 5.
The three books in Peter F. Hamilton's Greg Mandel series were written before his \\"Night's Dawn\\" series.  I'm not certain of this, but they seem to occur in the same universe as that series, just at a MUCH earlier time.  Regardless, this series is excellent.  What's especially nice, is that, for the most part, each of these books stands alone.  You still need to read them in order, but none of them ends in a cliff-hanger requiring your reading of the next.  Unfortunately, each of these books has a few fairly explicit sexual situations described in them.  The amount of sex increases as you move from book to book.  If it weren't for that, I'd recommend these books for everyone. <br /> <br />\\"Mindstar Rising\\" is the first book in the series.  It's a very good, fast-paced sci-fi action thriller.  The book introduces all the important characters and the \\"universe\\" used throughout the series.  For the most part, the character development is good.  I have a few qualms about a character or two suddenly being more capable than they are during the majority of the book, but that's mostly inconsequential. The plot, too, is very good.  However, the transition between the first, introductory, situation in the book and the primary situation could have been worked better:  it seems contrived.  But, I might be seeing that solely because I've read the book four times now. <br /> <br />\\"A Quantum Murder\\" is the second book in the series. This book takes place about three years after \\"Mindstar Rising.\\"  Instead of being the science-fiction action thriller that the first book is, it's more of a science fiction mystery.  It's a close call, but I think this book is slightly better than \\"Mindstar Rising.\\"  Once again, there's good character development, but this time, the plot is somewhat more tightly put together.  I've only got a couple of quibbles:  first, in one scene, Mandel's psi powers inexplicably include actual telepathy instead of just the empathy described in \\"Mindstar Rising.\\"And, second, after the characters find out who the murderer is, instead of sending the police out immediately, they close up shop for the night and say they'll do it in the morning.  Other than that, this is an excellent book which shows the origins of a lot of the technology in the \\"Night's Dawn\\" series. <br /> <br />\\"The Nano Flower\\" is the third, and final, book in the series.  The various dates specified in the book don't quite agree, but, in general, it seems to takes place about 16 years after \\"A Quantum Murder.\\"  Like \\"Mindstar Rising,\\" it's a sci-fi action thriller.  Like \\"A Quantum Murder,\\" it further develops technologies that Hamilton uses in his \\"Night's Dawn\\" series.  Also, as in \\"A Quantum Murder,\\" Mandel's psi-powers have once again expanded.  Of the three books, this is probably the best.  It's a hard comparison to make since the second book is more of a mystery and this book more of an action-thriller.  But, in general, I'd say there's an incremental improvement in these books as you move through the series (all of them are very good, though).

I realize I'm not in agreement with all the other reviews here, but I just wanted to throw my $0.02 in.  The impression I got from reading the other reviews was that this book would read something like Churchill's \\"Second World War\\" series:  sort of a narrative or story covering the war.  Instead, for the most part, this book is a reference book.  It's got tons of information in it, but it's organized into battles within time periods.  It's hard to explain.  I was looking for something that said we did x because of y which resulted in these battles.  Then, we did x' which led to some other battles.  Instead it said something like in year x we fought battles a, b, and c.  In year y, we fought battles d, e, and f.  All the information is there, but the \\"story\\" part of the \\"history\\" feels lacking.    If you're studying the Korean War, I do agree that this is an excellent book.  But, for a more \\"entertaining\\" study, I'd try something else (what that would be, I don't know).
Currently, there are six books in Brin's Uplift saga.  It's kind of hard to categorize these books as elements of a series, though.  The first three books in the saga, \\"Sundiver,\\" \\"Startide Rising,\\" and \\"The Uplift War,\\" are not really a trilogy or a series in the normal sense.  Instead, \\"Sundiver\\" relates to the rest of the saga as Tolkien's \\"The Hobbit\\" relates to his \\"Lord of the Rings:\\" it sets the stage for all the rest of the books in the saga.  \\"Startide Rising\\" and \\"The Uplift War\\" describe completely different plotlines originating from the same event far distant, time wise and space wise, from \\"Sundiver\\".  In a pinch, you could read these books in any order and not really miss anything.  They describe different points in time and space of the same Universe.  Of course, the best order is the one listed, above. <br /> <br />Unlike the first three books in the saga, the second three books DO form a series.  The first of this trilogy, \\"Brightness Reef,\\" picks up with yet another totally independent plotline and brand new characters.  However, it does contain a central character who ties the first three books into this set. Unfortunately, Brin doesn't say, specifically, who that character is until the very end of the book.  Even worse, the last time the character was used was so far back in the saga that it's hard to remember anything about him.  The remaining two books, \\"Infinity's Shore\\" and \\"Heaven's Reach,\\" continue sequentially from the first and form a tightly knit trilogy with no breaks in time. <br /> <br />None of these books is \\"happy\\" or \\"light reading.\\"  For the most part, they're all intense, heavily detailed and fully characterized books. \\"Sundiver\\" is the least \\"heavy\\" and most lacking in the realistic feel of the rest of the books.  But, for the most part, if you like \\"Sundiver,\\" you'll definitely want to continue with the rest of the saga.  Even if you don't like \\"Sundiver,\\" I highly recommend you read at least \\"Startide Rising:\\"  it has an entirely different feel to it and might be more to your liking.  This saga is just too important to miss out on.  As a whole, it's one of the great works of science fiction and one of the few pieces of science fiction that belong in the class of true literature. <br /> <br />The following are some comments on the individual books: <br /> <br />Sundiver:  Somewhat different from the other books in the saga in that it's more of a science fiction mystery than a science fiction drama.  This book sets the stage for the rest of the saga as it chronicles events that happen several hundred years before what happens in the other books.  About the only thing negative I can come up with is that I wish Brin had written several prequels to it so we could read about the earlier adventures of Jacob Demwa that are referenced in this book. <br /> <br />Startide Rising:  This book focuses on the group that starts all the other events noted in the remaining books of the saga.  Though the main characters start off in a very bad way, Brin does a good job of moving them forward, and upward, throughout the book. <br /> <br />The Uplift War:  The events in this book start from the same event that kicks off \\"Startide Rising.\\"  But, other than that, the two books are totally independent.  Like \\"Startide Rising,\\" Brin produced a gripping plot, great character development, and a good progression towards a positive goal. <br /> <br />Brightness Reef:  This is definitely not a happy book.  It starts out with many non-pleasant activities and fights its way forward from there.  The biggest problem I have with it is that it's very hard to see how anything good or positive is going to happen to the main characters, no matter how much they try. <br /> <br />Infinity's Shore:  First, the negative:  once this book starts, it's very apparent that a whole lot of relevant stuff has been happening elsewhere that we missed.  Essentially, there's at least one entire book that sounds extremely interesting that'smissing from the saga.  Brin fills in most of this back-story during this book and \\"Heaven's Reach.\\"  But, I'd sure like to have read that missing book.  On the positive side, this book re-introduces us to old friends and subtly changes the focus to them.  Everything's still happening in the same place with mostly the same characters, but the attitude changes and becomes more can-do. <br /> <br />Heaven's Reach:  One difficulty with this book is due to how it continues from the previous book.  It's merely a change of venue instead of a new set of adventures.  A quote from one of the main characters near the end of this book sort of sums up my feelings about it:  \\"...what will one more worry matter?  I've long passed the point where I stopped counting them.\\"  Essentially, by the time this book and saga starts winding down (and even at the point of that quotation, it really hasn't started that yet), the reader is totally fatigued by never-ending problems.  I really like these works, but the lack of a tie-up between \\"Infinity's Shore\\" and this book is grinding.

The premise of this book is an interesting one.  Unfortunately, Brin's writing talents at the time weren't what they are now.  Basically, the writing is trite and juvenile.  Looking at the copyright dates of his books, it looks like \\"The Practice Effect\\" is either his third or his fourth novel.  The first novel was \\"Sundiver\\" (1980).  The second was \\"Startide Rising\\" (1983).  Then in 1984, he wrote (apparently) both this book and \\"The Uplift War.\\"  From a technical perspective (i.e., the style of the writing), it's hard to believe that he wrote this book right in the middle of his Uplift War saga.  The writing style is far closer to that in his 1980 \\"Sundiver\\" (and \\"Sundiver\\" is FAR better than this book) than it is to his 1984 \\"The Uplift War.\\"  My guess is that he wrote this well before the rest, had it lying on a shelf, and just pushed it out to capitalize on his popularity.    Just for the sake of a comparison to his later works, and because the concept is so interesting, I do recommend people read it.  Just don't expect too much out of it.
This is the 8th in Cook's Garrett series (\\"Sweet Silver Blues,\\" \\"Bitter Gold Hearts,\\" \\"Cold Copper Tears,\\" \\"Old Tin Sorrows,\\" \\"Dread Brass Shadows,\\" \\"Red Iron Nights,\\" \\"Deadly Quicksilver Lies,\\" \\"Petty Pewter Gods,\\" \\"Faded Steel Heat,\\" \\"Angry Lead Skies,\\" and \\"Whispering Nickel Idols\\"). This is a good book that's fun to read.  Unfortunately, it's not quite as good as other books in Cook's Garrett series.  In many places, you can see that Cook wrote bits and pieces of the book and then cut-and-pasted them into the final order.  It's not a big problem -- it's just that the roughness is a bit disconcerting.  A more irritating problem is that Garrett is working with a couple of pantheons of gods which I just couldn't keep straight.  The individual gods, and the pantheons they belong to, just blend together and I couldn't tell who was doing what to whom.  The biggest problem, though, is that the ending just appears out of thin air in the last 10 pages of the book.  As I got closer and closer to the physical end, I kept wondering if this was going to be a two-parter:  there was just no indication of a reasonable solution.  With a sudden flurry of activity, the Dead Man and Garrett take a guess at what's going on and all heck breaks loose (which confirms their theory).  Not a very satisfying ending at all.  Still, I did enjoy reading the book and do recommend it (but read the earlier books, first).  I rate this book at 4 stars out of 5.    BTW: At the time of this review, this book is long out of print. It's tough to find anywhere. As an alternative, look around for the SFBC's \\"Garrett Investigates.\\" This book is part of that collection.
\\"Catspaw\\" is a MUCH better book than its prequel, \\"Psion.\\"  As with \\"Psion,\\" I don't care much for its theme that humans, especially wealthy powerful ones, are evil.  But, for \\"Catspaw,\\" that's pretty much overridden by how well Vinge writes and by the tightness of the plot.  About the only thing I didn't like in the book was the occasional lapse into unnecessary sexual details in about five different places.  Other than that, this is a very well-written book that I highly recommend.  If it weren't for the sense of loss a reader would suffer without having read \\"Psion,\\" I'd suggest skipping that book entirely.  Most of the necessary information comes out in this book.  But, it's not complete until almost halfway through the book.
&quot;Psion&quot; is merely an OK book. It's not bad, but it's certainly not good. The biggest problem is the overall shallowness, or even triteness, of everthing: theme, plot, and character development. The theme is essentially that humans are evil, especially if they have any kind of wealth or power. The plot's not that bad, though there are jumps where people do things that are just plain stupid. The worst part of the book is the character development. The characters DO develop. It's just that that development seems to be a step function (i.e., you don't see the character learn through experience: they just behave differently later in the book). Plus, I don't really like the main character as a person: he's essentially a victim and doesn't want to take any of the opportunities to improve himself that he's offered throughout the book. Even worse, though, is the villain. He nothing but a cardboard cutout. Not only does Vinge not develop his character thoughout the book, she's also given him no character in the first place. There's also a problem with several groups that ought to have been central to the book. Two that spring to mind are the aliens and the mine management on Cinder. Neither of these groups are given any kind of development. Vinge needs them to do certain things for the plot to proceed and so, Twin-Pines, they do them (some of the things she has the mine management do are absolutely not in their own best interest). <br />  <br /> Since this book is really required if you want to read the second book in the series, &quot;Catspaw,&quot; I still recommend you read it. Again, it's not a bad book. I wouldn't call it a light read, but at least it's not heavy.
I can't believe it.  Prior to my reading this novel, I've loved most everything Cherryh has written.  This is the first of her works that I haven't at least liked.  It started out well:  I was fully engrossed in the protagonist's trip through the desert.  But then, after that, Cherryh had them travel back (with a probable trip back, again).  Half way through that first return trip, I said enough was enough, nothing's happening, and put the book away.  Aside from the utter lack of a meaningful plot, I just couldn't fathom WHY this was happening:  one group of galactics needs to contact another, apparently fugitive, galactic and they take 30 years to do it via nanobots in the general population who then have to walk across the desert and die in droves to even find out that someone wants someone else to receive a message?  Huh?  Why didn't those galactics use some equivalent of a radio?  At the very least they could have tried walking up to the front door and talking.  How about skywriting?  Dropping a message capsule on the city?  Literally anything would have been more efficient than what they did.  I don't know why Cherryh wrote this the way she did, but I hope it's not repeated.
Unfortunately, this book is basically a political tract and not any kind of mystery. Even worse, the politics presented just reinforce my belief in how miserable this world is due to PC. To add insult to injury, the mysteries Flynn is trying to solve are trivial (essentially there for McDonald to wrap his politics around) and Flynn's wry attitude are taken to such an extreme that they go right past &quot;two-dimensional&quot; and into &quot;one-dimensional&quot; (i.e., the characterization are worse than flat). I suppose if you're a die-hard Flynn fan, you'll want to read this. But otherwise, I'd suggest staying far away: it's just too depressing to read.
Like its predecessor, &quot;Phule's Company,&quot; this book is a light, fun read.  The only thing I really didn't like about it was the very end.  If Asprin had left out the last page and a half, I'd have been very happy.  However, he added that last bit to provide a hook to later books.  I just don't think he needed that and it detracted from the ending of this book.  Other than that, though, I recommend this book for anyone looking for some light reading.
I had high hopes for this book.  Unfortunately, they were quickly dashed.  I don't know why Weis didn't team up with Hickman as is her wont.  But, the lack of a second author dooms the effort.  The book has an interesting premise, but is filled with inconsistencies, triteness, and plain ol' stupidity.  If Hickman had been around, they could have bounced the material off each other and corrected most of the bad writing before it hit the shelves.  As it is, it's practically un-stomachable.  I put the book away about half way through it as not being worth the effort.  But, I later picked it up and finished it in the hope it would get better.  It didn't.  It got worse.  I was practically gagging by the end.  Stay away from this book and its series.
If phrases like:  &quot;By lightly touching the Third Eye Point, for instance,... you can enhance your inner awareness.... and within a few weeks, you may notice that your intuition will begin to increase,&quot; sound reasonable to you, then this book is for you.  If your mindset lies somewhere beyond 12th century China, avoid this book like the plague.  All the other reviews here indicate that the people who wrote them believe accupressure works.  Maybe it does.  But, this book does nothing to explain or prove it in scientific terms.  Instead, it spouts mystical mumbo-jumbo as cause and effect.  If you're in chronic pain, and don't believe in fairy tales, then, instead of this book, I highly recommend &quot;The Trigger Point Therapy Workbook: Your Self-Treatment Guide for Pain Relief&quot; by Clair Davies here on Amazon (ISBN:  1572242507).  That book actually uses honest-to-goodness medical research for its recommendations.
John Varley is one of my favorite authors.  I like his work so much, I actually bought this book before reading the reviews here.  That was a mistake.  This is juvenile fiction that's not even fit for juvenile's to read (i.e., too much sex).  Some of the reviews compare this work to Heinlein's early, juvenile fiction, days.  It just doesn't compute.  Heinlein's early works were 1) interesting, and 2) not just for juvenile's but also boy-scoutish (i.e., clean).  Varley's \\"Red Thunder\\" is neither.  I can understand Varley's sexual themes in \\"Steel Beach\\" and \\"The Golden Globe:\\"  he's writing about advanced, bored societies at an adult level.  But, here, he's just going on and on about, essentially, the live's of a small group of late adolescents.  Heck, it takes him over half the book to get to a point where the characters actually start to get ready to do what they're going to do.  Note that I said \\"start to get ready,\\" not \\"start:\\"  the half-way point is when they actually get a glimmer of what they're going to do.  What a bore.<br />I suppose Varley figured he needed a bit of juvenile fiction to round out his audience base.  Unfortunately, he would have been better served by cutting out the first 150 pages of the book and deleting all the sex.  If he wanted \\"character\\" (hah) development with these kids, he should have ignored their poor, downtrodded lives and developed their characters while they actually did something that furthered the plot.<br />Stay away from this book.
An enjoyable, light book.  There's nothing really wrong with the book, but it's certainly not literature.  If you're tired of wading through books that make you think too much, try this one.  A great way to spend an afternoon.
In all probability, people who read the first of the Death Gate Cycle books and like it, are going to want to read all of the books in the series (regardless of any flucutation in the individual books' ratings).  Ditto for the reverse:  if people don't like the first book, then they're probably not going to want to read any of the other books in the series.  Thus, instead of individual book ratings, I've rated the whole series and given a short blurb on any specifics for each book.<br />Overall, this is a very good series.  The authors were amazingly creative in coming up with this concept and the books are well-written, extremely interesting, and internally consistent (mostly -- see below for some exceptions).  I highly recommend this series of books for everyone.  My comments for the indidual books follow:<br />Vol. 1 -- Dragon Wing:  This book covers the exploration of Arianus:  the realm of Air.  It introduces us to the two main characters (Haplo and Alfred) and many of the recurring characters throughout the series.  It's a well-paced, well-written book that's an excellent reresentation of what to expect in most of the rest of the series.  Essentially, if you like this book, you'll like the other six books.  If you don't like this book, then there's no sense in reading any of the others.<br />Vol. 2 -- Elven Star:  This book covers the exploration of Pryan:  the realm of Fire.  Alfred is entirely missing from this book, and Haplo isn't really the centerpiece.  Instead, the book is mostly written from the perspective of the mensch and of the newly introduced (and recurring) Zifnab.  The one possible weakness in the book is that Weis/Hickman wrote it such that the structure of Pryan itself is more of a mystery than Arianus was in the first book.<br />Vol. 3 -- Fire Sea:  This book covers the exploration of Abarrach:  the realm of Stone.  Once again, both Haplo and Alfred are present.  The characters and areas presented in this book are key elements for the entireseries.  An interesting book, but not a very happy one at all.<br />Vol. 4 -- Serpent Mage:  This book covers the exploration of Chelestra:  the realm of Water.  Both Alfred and Haplo are on this world.  But, for the most part, they follow separate plot lines.  There's a lot of action taking place throughout the book and Weis/Hickman introduce some actual Sartan (besides Alfred).  They also bring in an ancient evil to balance the ancient good introduced in the previous book.  The most irritating thing about this book is that it ends in a cliff-hanger.  The previous books tied up their worlds' activities fairly nicely.  Not so in this book.  It ends at a very inconvenient spot.<br />Vol. 5 -- Hand of Chaos:  This book returns Haplo to Arianus and the people he met there earlier.  Whereas the first four books of the series cover the exploration of the four realms, this book starts the synthesis of the various threads from those books into a movement towards closure.  It's a good book, but, unfortunately, it doesn't do anything with Alfred.  The previous book left Alfred heading towards a bad end.  This book doesn't do anything with that.  So, while reading the book, you constantly have this little voice in the back of your mind going &quot;what's happening with Alfred?&quot;  Irritating.<br />Vol. 6 -- Into the Labyrinth:  This book ranges across just about all of the worlds of the Death Gate.  It brings all of the various threads from the other books to a head.  Most importantly, it finally does something with Alfred.  The unfortunate thing about this book is that it contains a lot of technical errors (or, more specifically, contradictions).  For instance, in Dragon Wing, we're told that a person needs to be familiar with an area to use a transportation spell to get to that area.  Yet, very close to the beginning of the book, one of the characters uses such a spell without ever having been to her target location.  There are also several instances where the characters COULD have used such a spell, but don't.  Likewise, there are problems with replication spells.  In Fire Sea, Haplo and Alfred use such a spell to replicate enough food for a large group of people.  Yet, in this book, no one seems to consider using a replication spell to produce more of some food.  But, later on, those same people are using that same spell to replicate weapons.  Plus, at one point, Xar uses a spell to just materialize both food and drink for a party.  But, if such a thing is possible, why do the Patryns hunt and, apparently, farm in the Labyrinth?  Also, the size of the Labyrinth seems wrong.  From the previous books, it's taken hundreds (if not thousands) of years for various Patryns to traverse the hundreds of Gates in the Labryrinth.  Yet, in this book, from the very beginning of the Labyrinth they can see the results of things happening at the Final Gate.  There's also the problem of how people at the center of the Labyrinth would know anything about the Final Gate.<br />Vol. 7 -- Seventh Gate:  This is the conclusion of the Death Gate series.  Unforunately, I didn't much care for it.  Basically, it comes across as being pretty sappy.  All of a sudden, Haplo and Alfred are best buds and want to teach the world to sing in perfect harmony.  Most of the various threads are tied up adequately (if not very satifyingly).  But, the sudden push towards liberal &quot;peace, love, and harmony&quot; is trite.  Of the seven books in this series, this one is the least good.  Once again, I didn't much care for the tone of this book.  But, since it adequatly ties up most everything that needed tying up, I'm not going to downgrade the whole series because of that.

Most of the various threads are tied up adequately (if not very satifyingly).  But, the sudden push towards liberal &quot;peace, love, and harmony&quot; is trite.  Of the seven books in this series, this one is the least good.  Once again, I didn't much care for the tone of this book.  But, since it adequatly ties up most everything that needed tying up, I'm not going to downgrade the whole series because of that.
In all probability, people who read the first of the Death Gate Cycle books and like it, are going to want to read all of the books in the series (regardless of any flucutation in the individual books' ratings).  Ditto for the reverse:  if people don't like the first book, then they're probably not going to want to read any of the other books in the series.  Thus, instead of individual book ratings, I've rated the whole series and given a short blurb on any specifics for each book.<br />Overall, this is a very good series.  The authors were amazingly creative in coming up with this concept and the books are well-written, extremely interesting, and internally consistent (mostly -- see below for some exceptions).  I highly recommend this series of books for everyone.  My comments for the indidual books follow:<br />Vol. 1 -- Dragon Wing:  This book covers the exploration of Arianus:  the realm of Air.  It introduces us to the two main characters (Haplo and Alfred) and many of the recurring characters throughout the series.  It's a well-paced, well-written book that's an excellent reresentation of what to expect in most of the rest of the series.  Essentially, if you like this book, you'll like the other six books.  If you don't like this book, then there's no sense in reading any of the others.<br />Vol. 2 -- Elven Star:  This book covers the exploration of Pryan:  the realm of Fire.  Alfred is entirely missing from this book, and Haplo isn't really the centerpiece.  Instead, the book is mostly written from the perspective of the mensch and of the newly introduced (and recurring) Zifnab.  The one possible weakness in the book is that Weis/Hickman wrote it such that the structure of Pryan itself is more of a mystery than Arianus was in the first book.<br />Vol. 3 -- Fire Sea:  This book covers the exploration of Abarrach:  the realm of Stone.  Once again, both Haplo and Alfred are present.  The characters and areas presented in this book are key elements for the entireseries.  An interesting book, but not a very happy one at all.<br />Vol. 4 -- Serpent Mage:  This book covers the exploration of Chelestra:  the realm of Water.  Both Alfred and Haplo are on this world.  But, for the most part, they follow separate plot lines.  There's a lot of action taking place throughout the book and Weis/Hickman introduce some actual Sartan (besides Alfred).  They also bring in an ancient evil to balance the ancient good introduced in the previous book.  The most irritating thing about this book is that it ends in a cliff-hanger.  The previous books tied up their worlds' activities fairly nicely.  Not so in this book.  It ends at a very inconvenient spot.<br />Vol. 5 -- Hand of Chaos:  This book returns Haplo to Arianus and the people he met there earlier.  Whereas the first four books of the series cover the exploration of the four realms, this book starts the synthesis of the various threads from those books into a movement towards closure.  It's a good book, but, unfortunately, it doesn't do anything with Alfred.  The previous book left Alfred heading towards a bad end.  This book doesn't do anything with that.  So, while reading the book, you constantly have this little voice in the back of your mind going &quot;what's happening with Alfred?&quot;  Irritating.<br />Vol. 6 -- Into the Labyrinth:  This book ranges across just about all of the worlds of the Death Gate.  It brings all of the various threads from the other books to a head.  Most importantly, it finally does something with Alfred.  The unfortunate thing about this book is that it contains a lot of technical errors (or, more specifically, contradictions).  For instance, in Dragon Wing, we're told that a person needs to be familiar with an area to use a transportation spell to get to that area.  Yet, very close to the beginning of the book, one of the characters uses such a spell without ever having been to her target location.  There are also several instances where the characters COULD have used such a spell, but don't.  Likewise, there are problems with replication spells.  In Fire Sea, Haplo and Alfred use such a spell to replicate enough food for a large group of people.  Yet, in this book, no one seems to consider using a replication spell to produce more of some food.  But, later on, those same people are using that same spell to replicate weapons.  Plus, at one point, Xar uses a spell to just materialize both food and drink for a party.  But, if such a thing is possible, why do the Patryns hunt and, apparently, farm in the Labyrinth?  Also, the size of the Labyrinth seems wrong.  From the previous books, it's taken hundreds (if not thousands) of years for various Patryns to traverse the hundreds of Gates in the Labryrinth.  Yet, in this book, from the very beginning of the Labyrinth they can see the results of things happening at the Final Gate.  There's also the problem of how people at the center of the Labyrinth would know anything about the Final Gate.<br />Vol. 7 -- Seventh Gate:  This is the conclusion of the Death Gate series.

I'm sorry to say that this book isn't in the same league as C.S. Friedman's other books.  First of all, I have problems with the back story:  originally, mankind set out for the stars but then found that the star drive they were using mutated their genes.  OK.  But, then, why did all the people on any given ship have their genes mutate in the exact same way so that they produced a viable, fertile species?  It seems to me, you would have ended up with a lot of unique, sterile, monsters.  Oh, well. But, I think my biggest problem with the book is that it just doesn't grab my attention.  As I read it (and the writing, per se, is good), I basically felt nothing.  Everything, including the main character,  is bland.  I did enjoy the book, but that was purely from a mechanistic point of view.  The story and characters never really meant anything to me.  I hope Friedman can raise the excitement level in her future works to match that found in her other past works.  This book, for all the work she obviously put into it, is basically filler.
I love this book.  I've read it four or five times now and find it better each time.  The only reason I don't give it five stars is that it IS a bit hokey (i.e., simplistic).  But, its sheer massiveness and level of fun outweighs that.  A science fiction classic that is well worth reading.  WARNING:  under no circumstances watch the movie -- that thing sucks.
Shon'jir, the 2nd book in the &quot;Faded Sun&quot; trilogy, is much better than Kesrith (the 1st book).  It's not a matter of writing styles or ability (which are the same in both books: very good).  It's just that in Shon'jir something actually happens.  It even ends at a reasonable point (for the 2nd book in a trilogy).  In the 1st book, Cherryh basically introduces the mri and the main characters  In this book, she brings us through Duncan's journey (in all senses) towards the mri.  A very good, very interesting book.
Kutath, the final book in the &quot;Faded Sun&quot; series, picks up where the 2nd book, &quot;Shon'jir,&quot; leaves off.  In this book, Duncan has completed his journey towards the mri and Cherryh takes us towards a final resolution of the mri/human/regul relationship.  The book is just as well-written and interesting as &quot;Shon'jir.&quot;  About the only negative I can come up with is the somewhat drawn-out initial tableau involving walking across the desert:  it gets a bit tedious after a while.  A very good book.
The title for my review pretty much says it all:  the first book of this trilogy is SLOW, but after that, Cherryh picks it right up and produces an excellent trilogy.  Well worth reading.  I've included my individual reviews of each title in the book, below:<br />&quot;If something had actually happened in &quot;Kesrith,&quot; I'm sure it would have been a great book. Well, I'm probably exaggerating a bit. But, for the first 170 pages of this 250 page book, absolutely nothing happens. It's essentially the background social, political, and military information of all the major players. Around page 170 and for the next 80 pages, lots of really interesting things happen. Unfortunately, they don't really end. This book is merely the prologue for its sequels. I have no problem with book trilogies. But, there has to be SOME kind of closure in each of the books. This book just gets going and then stops. Highly frustrating.&quot;<br />&quot;Shon'jir, the 2nd book in the &quot;Faded Sun&quot; trilogy, is much better than Kesrith (the 1st book).

For the most part, I found this book to be much more engrossing than the other two.  However, throughout it, I was worried about what the authors were going to do for the ending.  I was right to worry.  Essentially, Weis/Hickman just took a mechanistic approach to getting the ending done.  Everyone in the book seems to have the same idea  for winning the game: get to a certain place and do a certain thing.  The only difference being the interpretation they put on things.  And that's what happened.  Basically, we have multiple paths leading, linearly, to the same point.  I had hoped that the point would expand out to a big knot with twists and turns, plots and fights.  But, unfortunately, it didn't happen.  Everyone gets where they're going, waives their respective hands in the air, does the obvious, and, presto-chango, it's done.  Phizzle.  That, plus the constant introduction and subsequent dropping of various ***main*** characters throughout the book, makes it quite a let-down.  In general, a decent trilogy.  But, especially because of the ending, nothing to write home to Mom about.
Like the first book in the series, &quot;Well of Darkness,&quot; I enjoyed reading it.  Overall, it was written somewhat better than the earlier work.  Weis/Hickman dropped a lot of the simplistic/childish atmosphere in the first book and wrote this one more for adults (that could be a function of the main characters actually BEING children in the first book).  There are several logic holes/disagreements that irritate me about this book.  But, they're easily forgiven.  Also, the first book tended to portray Good as stupid and Evil as clever.  In this book, the authors modified that a bit so that Good was merely weak, but, unfortunately, Evil is both clever and overwhelming.  I don't know if that's an improvement or not.  I'll have to wait until I finish the third book before I figure that out.  If you've read the first book, this one is definitely worth reading, too.
I was really worried that this book might have been a standard new-age, make-a-buck, quack title.  Thank goodness that turned out to be a groundless worry.  This is an excellent book (with medical references) that does a very good job of helping you get rid of pain.  I had hurt my lower back by performing the arduous task of putting on my underwear.  The doctors and physical therapist couldn't really come up with a reason for it.  After a month, it still wasn't getting any better.  Searching the web gave me references to this book.  Within three days of reading it and poking around in my UPPER (not LOWER) back, my thighs, and my abdomen, the pain has faded to just a reminder.  I'm still not able to bend and reach like I used to.  But, I'm exercising and stretching again, so hopefully that'll change.  Best of all, it no longer hurts just to SIT (or lie down or stand, for that matter).  After showing my wife that her lower body has just about every active trigger point known, she's also reading the book and working on her points.  Hopefully, her pain will reduce in a couple of days, too.<br />The only reason I gave this book four stars instead of five is that it's kind of hard to find and reference ALL the trigger points associated with a specfic pain FOR THE FIRST TIME.  The book does have a diagram for pain locations at the start of each chapter.  But, in many cases, the pain will be caused by multiple trigger points in multiple body locations.  It takes quite a bit of paging through the book to figure out what you're supposed to do.  Once you figure it out, though, the book is great.  Of course, in the author's defense, I can't come up with a better organization method outside of having some kind of software with an anatomical display using hyperlinks.<br />I HIGHLY RECOMMEND this book if you suffer from any kind of chronic pain.  Even if your doctor has pronounced judgement that he/she knows what's causing things, try this book.  As the author says, trigger pointtherapy should be the first course of treatment:  it's easy and cheap.
The idea behind this novel (a cosmos where the gravitational constant is one billion times that of ours), is extremely interesting.  Baxter should definitely be applauded for coming up with something like this and fleshing it out somewhat.  Unfortunately, his writing skills are lacking.  First, the overall flavor of the novel is somewhat juvenile.  Characters are flat but also inconsistent (similar to what one reviewer here said, the main character is a genius leader one minute but an idiot child the next).  Second, the plot basically is held together through miraculous happenings.<br />But, worst of all, since Baxter is a physicist, is that Baxter's physics are inconsistent (i.e., wrong in some places).  For instance, the Belt is a linked set of facilities in orbit around a &quot;star&quot; (which is, itself, in orbit around the center of the cosmos, the Core).  There's a microgravity field from the Belt's own mass pulling things from above and below.  Yet, somehow, the miners drop a chair down to the &quot;star&quot; by cable.  Orbits don't work that way.  Assuming they could get the chair away from the belt (and a simple push would probaby be enough), all it would do is go into an elliptical orbit crossing the Belt's orbit.  To get to the surface of the &quot;star,&quot; they'd need some kind of thrust (and I won't even go into how the cable would end up wrapping around the &quot;star&quot; as the chair changed orbits).<br />Another example from the Belt is when they're trying to deliver a very heavy food machine.  The thing is floating above the Belt.  That means it's co-orbital with it.  The ropes holding the machine break and the thing falls past the Belt, past the star, and down to the Core.  Sorry.  But since it's co-orbital, the darn thing would just float around there.  Baxter uses that co-orbital floating trick later in the book when a couple of the characters float around &quot;above&quot; the Belt until rescued.<br />There are similar physics problems at the Raft.  First, and very obviously, there is a &quot;star&quot; which is &quot;falling&quot; towards the Raft.  It stays there for most of the book.  But, since the Raft is orbiting the Core, there's no way something falling toward the Core from a higher orbit would stay fixed above the Raft.  Since the gravitational constant is so huge in this cosmos, orbiting bodies move VERY quickly.  That &quot;star&quot; would be spiralling all over the heavens on its way down.<br />In another Raft case, some bad people are trying to make some others &quot;walk the plank&quot; off the edge of the Raft.  So what?  Again, this thing's in orbit.  Walk off the edge, and aside from local gravitational effects, you'd just hang there.  This is very similar to a point near the end when the people break a big chunk of the Raft off.  It goes plummeting &quot;down&quot; and people fall though the hole to their death.  Once again, orbits don't work this way.<br />There are a lot of other lesser things that are wrong about the physics (the atmosphere is in orbit, too -- where's the weather?), but those are the big ones.  With the plot and character problems, these essentially make the book not really worth reading.  It's a shame, since the idea behind the book is so clever.  But, I just can't recommend the book.
One of these days, I'm going to learn to never buy a book before reading the reviews on Amazon.  Unfortunately, I was in a used book store, saw this, and bought it on the spot.  What a mistake.  I'm currently on page 382 of 518 and that's as far as I'm going.  I'm not going to read through yet another rape, yet another child eating, yet another set of torment/torture, yet another scene of how rotten Stephen Baxter thinks mankind (and all it's various ancestral lines) is.  Also, I'm tired of reading through all that stuff without any progress in the plot.  Basically, I'm 74% of the way through the book, and nothing's happened to 1) re-unite the main man with the main woman, or 2) tell us who, why, or how the moon is flying through the multiverse picking up and dumping off hominids. Unless you're into being alternately bored and disgusted all while being confused, don't bother with this book.
The first part of this book (up through about page 119) is pretty good.  It starts out where H.G. Wells leaves off with his \\"Time Machine\\" and puts the Traveller into a different Leg of the Trousers of Time (LToT) from what he first went down.  However, after that Baxter becomes internally inconsistent.  The Traveller goes back to where he first gets involved in his Time Machine.  Then someone from a different LToT comes back and rips that leg of the pants right off.  Yet, everyone moves into that now missing LToT and is bored to death in it by Londonian details for a hundred pages or so.  Then, we go WAAAAAY back and mess with various things that ought to have smashed that same LToT for sure.  Instead, things come back from it yet again.  Really, the book would have been better with the whole middle two-thirds missing.  This is especially true since an awful lot of it (well, actually, an awful lot of the whole book) involves bashing humans as the worst thing ever developed.<br /><br />I'm really not all that enamoured of the book.  However, the cleverness of extending H.G. Wells' \\"Time Machine\\" the way he did lets me bring my rating up from two stars to three stars.  Somewhat boring, but interesting.
I've got only two small nits with this book.  First, the characters seem to be somewhat stilted in behavior.  However, it's very possible this is just a function of the genre.  It's not all that bad, but it is noticeable.  Second, throughout the book, Good is usually depicted as being somewhat stupid, and Evil is not necessarily portrayed as bad, but instead is portrayed as somewhat clever.  I guess it's a philosophical difference between me and the authors (or what they're trying to do with this series).  Overall, though, the book is still very well done.  I enjoyed it.
The two stories in this volume are totally independent of each other.  In the forward, Cherryh tries to paper over this by saying in the vast reaches of human space, totally different things can be happening at the same time.  In reality, these stories just have nothing to do with each other.  Outside of being some of Cherryh's very earliest work, they have no business being in the same book.  HOWEVER, from the point-of-view of price and of getting these books back in print, I think the publisher had a good idea in doing this.  Each of the stories is interesting and about equally well done.  If you haven't read these books, then this volume is a good way to get them both.  Here are my individual ratings:<br />&quot;Brothers of Earth&quot; is Cherryh's first novel. It's an interesting book, but bears no resemblence to her later books. It's a fairly well written book that explores some interesting concepts. Unfortunately, the book doesn't really go anywhere. Specifically, the main character isn't pushing towards some kind of solution. He's essentially along for the ride. The end result is that things just happen and then the book ends. It's not a very satisfactory ending at all. If you're a die-hard Cherryh fan, I'd say you should read this book just because it's her first. It's not bad, but it's also not that good. <br />You can tell &quot;Hunter of Worlds&quot; is a very early C.J. Cherryh novel. The text is nowhere near as riveting as her later works. You can see where her later style comes from in this work, but it's really not fully present here. In general, it's an ok story. But, you never really buy into it fully. It's like you pick up in the middle of something and then put it away after something happens. You get an inkling of what the various races are like, how they behave, and what they're capable of, but it never really meshes into a consistent whole. You know that the races are different, but you really don't feel it in your bones about WHY they're different. I'm glad I read the book, but it's merely a shadow of Cherryh's later works.

I don't care what the \\"official\\" write-ups for this book say:  this is not just a book for teens.  Outside of the fact that the protagonist is a child and some of the behavior/situations are somewhat simplified, this is standard Discworld fare.  I've marked the book down from five stars to four because of this mild \\"simplification,\\" but other than that, it's wonderful.  Also, the book is much more funny than the latest Discworld novels have been.  This is an excellent book to read with good pacing, a good story, and, probably most importantly, a very satisfying ending.  Very enjoyable.  Read it.
I don't agree with the Reading Level assigned to this book (ages 9-12). Sure, 9-12 year olds could read it without problem. But, it's not a really a kid's book. It's just a very, very good book that's fun and light to read. It's also almost entirely independent of any need for prior knowledge of the Discworld. At a guess, I'd assign it a place just after \\"Moving Pictures\\" (purely based on the \\"Gaspode-the-Wonder-Dog\\" affect plus the fact that Maurice is mentioned twice in \\"Reaper Man\\" (which comes just after \\"Moving Pictures\\")). It's definitely a book to read. Anyone CAN read it and everyone SHOULD read it.

This is the 28th in Pratchett's Discworld series.  It's also one of the standalone books (\\"Equal Rites,\\" \\"Pyramids,\\" \\"Moving Pictures,\\" \\"Small Gods,\\" \\"The Truth,\\" and \\"Monstrous Regiment\\").  I'm not sure where Pratchett wanted to go with this book (or even if he knew where he wanted to go with it).  Since it was published well after 9-11, I assumed he would use it as another platform for the anti-military, anti-nationalism philosophy-apparent that he bared in \\"Jingo.\\"  Thankfully, this isn't so.  He seems to have moderated his stance there quite a bit.  Unfortunately, that left this book wandering all over the place trying to come to a satisfactory ending.  Part of the problem is that the protagonists, though fairly good, are on the wrong side:  they're part of the enemy.  You're left trying to figure out how Pratchett's going to have them succeed personally but have them lose group-wise.  What he ends up with is sort of stop-gap.  Heck, he even seems to realize this himself since at the very end everyone seems to be right back where they started (outside of the female emancipation stuff).  Also, every single character in the book (including the main one) is pretty two-dimensional.  It's like they're all putting in cameo appearances (especially the members of the Watch).  Pretty disappointing.  Overall, the book isn't bad.  But, it certainly isn't funny and it sure isn't up to his usual standards.  I rate it at a mere 3 stars out of 5.
About the best I can say for this book is that it isn't really BAD.  It starts out pretty interesting, but then its energy seems to slowly drip out of it until the ending feels like merely a dotting of &quot;i&quot;s and a crossing of &quot;t&quot;s.  Also, at about the midpoint, the book takes on a bit of a sappy tone which increases throughout the remainder of the story.  I also have problems with the amount of future slang used.  I understand that Foster is using it to set the tone, but even the main character uses it constantly:  it just gets too tiresome trying to parse it into real English so you can figure out what he's saying.  There also seems to be some kind of problem with the editor:  I counted five uses of the non-word &quot;irregardless&quot; in this book.  I can't understand how anyone who's written as much as Alan Dean Foster could use that &quot;word&quot; instead of the proper &quot;regardless.&quot;  I sure can't understand why his editors didn't catch it.  There are also several scenes where someone didn't catch contextual problems.  For instance, at one point, the protagonist has been disarmed, has escaped, and has incapacitated one of his assailants.  He then goes about his merry business without taking the captured, unconcious assailant into custody for questining and without picking up his weapon (and people are trying to kill him).  In another case, he tells someone that a certain event has happened to her father.  Suddenly, that person seems to have full knowledge of the event.  Specifically, she knows when it happened even though no one has told her that.  There are also several characters introduced into the book who don't seem to have any purpose.  They're just there for a page or two and then they're gone:  flavor, I guess.  In general, there also seem to be a lot of cases where important things happen and no one does anything to track them down and figure out why, who or how.  They're just like magical events which conviently appear topush the plot along.  If you've got some time to kill, reading this book might be worth a shot.  But, otherwise, despite it's promising beginning, it's not really worth the effort.
I really liked the concept behind this book.  But, Pullman's implementation is lacking.  First, I have problems believing that any 11-year old (even one in a fantasy novel) could or would behave as the one in this book does.  Heck, you could push her to the age of majority (18) and I still would have the same problem.  Second, the novel's world doesn't make sense.  Yes, I know it's an alternate reality.  But, the mish-mash of technologies present are silly.  For the most part, the culture seems to work on a set of technology from the 1500s to the 1800s.  But, then there are things thrown in which indicate technology from the 1900s or 2000s.  I just can't come up with a logical technology tree that would allow this to happen.  And, finally, all the characters around the protagonist are basically cardboard cutouts:  they have no depth of personality.  For instance, I still can't figure out what's motivating all these bad guys to do the horrible things they're doing to these children.  Sure, near the end, Pullman explained what they think \\"Dust\\" is.  But, I still can't see how these people made the leap from having that knowledge to, essentially, mutilating and killing children.
To say the least, I'm very upset with the other three reviews here which all gave this book a five star rating.  It's just not so.  This book is terrible.  Essentially, it's like reading a comic book.  All the characters are one-sided, extreme caricatures.  I got through about page forty (where the main &quot;characters&quot; are picking their crew) before I couldn't take it any more.  Every new &quot;character&quot; was a new oddball.  I mean, forget about these people being characters in a book.  Just think about them as forming a small crew who are going on a one-way mission in a tin can.  They'll be en-route for forty years and studying the new system for twenty more.  No organization in the universe would pick these people as crew.  They wouldn't make it to Mars orbit before they ended up killing each other.  Every member of the crew would have been psychologically screened until their brains fell out of their heads.  The people who survived that screening and were deemed capable of living in extremely close quarters with a couple of handfuls of other people for the rest of their lives would have trained together for YEARS just to make sure everything was OK.  This book is a joke as science fiction.  Either that, or it was written for the youth market.  Terrible, terrible book.  Avoid.
As of this writing, this book is the 5th in, and the end of, the Chanur series.  It's excellently written and, surprising for a Cherryh book, actually ENJOYABLE to read.  Usually, Cherryh's books are so gut-wrenchingly engrossing that you have nothing left with which to enjoy it.  This book appeals somewhat more to the intellect than to the intestines.  The tension is there, but it's far more subdued than in her other works.  One of the interesting tension-makers is how Hilfy Chanur treats the male Hani she gets stuck with.  From our Human point of view, it's really tough to understand.  However, over time, you come to understand it from a Hani (i.e. lion) perspective.  An excellent book and a suitable end/extension to the Chanur saga.
This is the fourth book in the (currently) five book Chanur series.  It's also the end of the trilogy that's left incomplete in the supposed &quot;omnibus edition&quot; &quot;The Chanur Saga.&quot;  As usual for Cherryh, this is an excellently written book that reaches down into your gut and shakes you around.  As I'm re-reading these books in quick order, I found this book to be a better read than the previous two in the trilogy.  Essentially, it's written at a more sustainable emotional pitch.  The first two books in the trilogy just never let up.  From the minute you pick them up to the minute they (don't) end, everything goes wrong and everyone's either evil, an enemy, or a fool (or some combination of the three).  This book gives you a bit of a break.  There are actually other people in it besides the protagonists who are good, competent, and/or an ally.  The pacing is also more reasonable.  You're not on the edge of your seat on every page.  The pitch actually increases fairly smoothly throughout the book.  An excellent end to the middle trilogy of the Chanur series.
This is the sequel to &quot;Chanur's Venture.&quot;  It continues where that book leaves off.  Unfortunately, like that book, this one doesn't end properly.  The ending here is slightly more reasonable than what the publisher did with &quot;Chanur's Venture,&quot; but if you read this book, you'd better have a copy of &quot;Chanur's Homecoming&quot; (the sequel) handy.  As with the prior Chanur books, this one is excellently written.  However, this one does go on a bit too much with everything possible going wrong at the worst possible time.  After about 170 pages of that in &quot;Chanur's Venture,&quot; the additional 270 pages here gets exhausting.  If the book had ended at a more reasonable point, I'd have given it four stars.
I entirely blame the publisher for the bad rating I'm giving this book.  The story and the writing are both excellent.  However, putting these three stories in one book and saying \\"Now in one magnificient omnibus edition\\" is a crime.  The first story, \\"The Pride of Chanur,\\" naturally stands alone.  It should have been left as a stand-alone book.  The other two stories, \\"Chanur's Venture\\" and \\"The Kif Strike Back,\\" should never have been sold as separate books in the first place:  each requires the other.  However, the biggest problem is that \\"The Kif Strike Back\\" requires (at least) one more book, \\"Chanur's Homecoming\\" to tie things up.  So, don't expect this \\"magnificent omnibus edition\\" to complete the story.  You'll definitely have to buy at least one other book.<br />My apologies to Cherryh on this.  Her writing is excellent.  It's just her publisher that [is bad].
And the pendulum swings.  About every 10 years, I re-read Roger Zelazny's \\"This Immortal.\\"  The last time, I felt that it hadn't weathered the intervening decades since its publication (1965) very well.  This time, I'm scratching my head wondering what I was thinking, and am revising my rating of the book to a Very Good 4 stars out of 5.  This is quintessential Zelazny:  man crossed with myth.  There's definitely a lot of 1960s (and 1970s, surprisingly) metaphysical writing going on here.  But, it works well with the story.  In fact, the prose is practically poetic.  It's very nicely described, thought-provoking, and both intellectually and emotionally satisfying.  Also, according to the Wikipedia entry for the book, \\"it tied with Frank Herbert's Dune for the 1966 Hugo Award for Best Novel.\\"  I can definitely see why.<br /><br />A note about the Kindle edition:  I bought this first Kindle version within a week of its first appearance.  Unfortunately, there are a lot of OCR-type errors strewn throughout the book.  This is a bit upsetting since the publisher is charging about $8 for a 50 year old book.  For that kind of money, I'd expect someone to have actually proof-read the conversion.  Oh, well.  I assume later editions will correct this.
This book picks up about a year after &quot;The Pride of Chanur&quot; leaves off.  From the very first moment, you're caught up in the plot and furiously trying to turn the pages faster and faster in order to see what's going to happen.  But, then, after about 170 pages of extremely well written, tightly packed, emotionally wrenching, pages, right at the very pinnacle of tension, it ENDS!  Aaaargh!  There's no excuse for this except pure greed on the part of the publisher.  This book should never have been published without its sequel, &quot;The Kif Strike Back.&quot;  I feel really bad giving such an excellent piece of work such a bad rating.  But, unless you have the sequel handy (perhaps as part of the &quot;omnibus edition&quot; &quot;The Chanur Saga&quot; (which apparently ends without ITS finish)), I can't recommend you read it.  If you've got the sequel(s), definitely read all of them.  But, don't get just this book.
I'm currently re-reading this in it's incarnation as the first part of \\"The Chanur Saga\\" \\"Omnibus edition.\\"  I wanted to put a separate review here since I intend to rate that \\"omnibus\\" low simply because it's not complete.  \\"The Pride of Chanur\\" is an excellent book.  Written in the standard Cherryh \\"from the gut\\" manner, it grabs on to your emotions and yanks them hither and yon from the first couple of pages all the way to the end.  It's one of those books where you try to read faster and faster so that you can find out what's going to happen (even after having read it several times before).  The best part of the book is the fact that it's stand-alone:  it finishes what it starts.  The remainder of the series requires this book.  But, this book doesn't require the remainder of the series (though you'll definitely want to read that).  Excellent book.
If something had actually happened, I'm sure it would have been a great book.  Well, I'm probably exaggerating a bit.  But, for the first 170 pages of this 250 page book, absolutely nothing happens.  It's essentially the background social, political, and military information of all the major players.  Around page 170 and for the next 80 pages, lots of really interesting things happen.  Unfortunately, they don't really end.  This book is merely the prologue for its sequels.  I have no problem with book trilogies.  But, there has to be SOME kind of closure in each of the books.  This book just gets going and then stops.  Highly frustrating.
This is a very good book that's right up there with Solzhenitsyn's &quot;Gulag Archipelago.&quot;  It's not exciting to read (very few histories are), but the information contained in it is vital to our understanding of the Soviet Union's past, and Russia's present and future.  This is vital to ensure that in the future, this type of thing doesn't happen again.
It must have taken me darn near a year to read all six volumes in this work.  They're inconceivably great.  They're certainly not fast reading (as evidenced by how long it took for me to complete the set), but they're truly awe inspiring.  As I read through the work, the same thing kept running through my head:  if it weren't for this man (Winston Churchill), we'd all be speaking German right now.  There's no doubt about it.  It's amazing that this set doesn't form the reading for a required course for every person in America.  I don't know about the education system in Britain, but if it's not required reading there, something has truly gone wrong with that country.  I can't stress enough how much I mean it when I say:  &quot;you MUST read these works.&quot;
I couldn't take it.  Day after day, I forced myself to read a little bit more of this book.  Day after day, it made me more and more ill.  It's hard to believe that such a good writer as Bujold could take her Vorkosigan saga and turn it into this.  For all intents and purposes, there's no plot whatsoever outside of Miles trying to woo his lady love.  Oh, sure, there's Mark having troubles with his girlfriend and with a startup business.  There's some stuff about Gregor and his wedding.  And, in the closest thing to approach anything beyond self-absorbed mush, there's some stuff involving the succession to a couple of Countships.  But, as of page 295 (out of 534), there's nothing else.  Ugh.  I'm sorry.  But, where's someone saving the world?  Or, how about saving a fleet?  Destroying an evil scourge?  Saving Miles' life?  Mark's?  Anyone's?  Nope.  Nothing.  It's all trivial stuff that's important only to the characters involved.  I'd also like to point out that almost every person in the book, though most are over 30, acts like a love-sick, idiotic teenager.  In fact, to show you how out of character everyone is, the most mature person in the book is Ivan, Miles' cousin.  It looks like this is the last of the Vorkosigan series I'll ever read.  I've read all the other books in the Vorkosigan series (and loved them all).  I've also read Bujold's books outside the series and they're pretty good. So, I guess that's where I'll look from now on.
I enjoyed reading this book.  But, I can see the writing on the wall.  It looks like from now on Bujold is going to focus more on Mile's romance and personal activities instead of on an Action and Adventure type of plot.  The Romance is well written, but I'd rather it took up 10% of the book instead of the 90% it did here.  It looks like &quot;Mirror Dance&quot; was the last &quot;true&quot; Vorkosigan book, with &quot;Memory&quot; serving as the transition, and &quot;Komarr&quot; as the first of the new style.  A shame, really.  But, still good.
When I first figured out what Miles was going to do to resolve the initial dilemma of the book, I started yelling at the book &quot;NO!  NO!  DON'T DO IT!&quot;  When he proceeded to ignore my advice, I thought the rest of the book would be a loss.  But, fortunately for all of us, Bujold worked it out properly in the end.  An absolutely wonderful book on par with &quot;Mirror Dance.&quot;  I'm not sure why Bujold felt it was time for Miles to move on.  But, she did it well.  This is the definite, no-going-back transition point.  A must read.
This is probably the best book in the whole Miles Vorkosigan series.  Interestingly, most of the book is written not from Miles' perspective, but from Mark's.  Whereas Bujold merely introduced Mark in the previous book, &quot;Brothers in Arms,&quot; in this book she fleshes him out (both literally and figuratively).  This book also sets the stage for what's coming up in the next book, &quot;Memory.&quot;  So, whatever you do, don't miss  this book.  Not only is it essential, but it's also great.
For the most part, I really enjoyed this book.  It's an excellent segment of the Vorkosigan saga and introduces Mark.  My only reason for downgrading it from a five star rating to a four star rating is that the very beginning irritates me.  Essentially, Miles is being beaten by what appears to be bureaucratic bumbling.  But, once he figures out what's really happening, things proceed nicely.  Very good book.
Normally, I dislike reading short stories: there's just no time to fully flesh out the characters. However, in this case, since these are part of the Miles Vorkosigan saga (and we're all familiar with him, his background, and his environment by now), I loved them. Each of the three short stories in the collection (\\"The Mountains of Mourning,\\" \\"Labyrinth,\\" and \\"The Borders of Infinity\\") are about 100 pages long, very interesting, and very well done. These short stories are also not peripheral to Miles' story. They seem to be covering central aspects of Miles and the Dendarii. The only downside to the book is that the three stories, though published in this one book, take place between different sets of the major books.  Specifically, the first of the short stories happens during the short gap between Miles' graduation from the Academy and his first military assignment (i.e., between [[ASIN:1886778272 The Warrior's Apprentice]] and [[ASIN:0606183833 The Vor Game]]).  While the second and third stories occur after [[ASIN:0671877445 Cetaganda]] and before [[ASIN:1416555447 Brothers in Arms]].  Nothing insurmountable, but it's disconcerting. I rate it an excellent 5 stars out of 5.
I was torn on whether I should give this book four stars or five.  I ended up going with four purely because of the extent of Miles' \\"ga-ga-ishness\\" over the haut Rian.  It's just too extreme for Miles' personality.  Other than that, I loved the book.  It fleshes out both Ivan and one of Barrayar's main rivals:  Cetaganda.  It also contains a paragraph that kicks off the \\"Terrence Cee\\" plot in Ethan of Athos.  Overall, a very good book to read.  4 stars out of 5.
About the only thing bad I can say about this book is that the pace is a bit uneven.  During the early phase of the book, while Miles is the Weather Officer on Kyril Island, things are a bit slow.  This segment of the book is necessary for future developments though, so it couldn't just have been cut.  But still, its pace is slower than that of the rest of the book.  Other than that triviality, it's really an excellent read.  I give it 5 stars out of 5.
Great book.  This is the first of the series which focuses on Miles (essentially, as he comes of age).  It's fast-paced and makes you want to read faster so you can see what's going to happen.  A definite \\"must read\\" if you're at all interested in the series.  I rate it at 5 stars out of 5.
...    Standing alone, each of the two stories in this book are very good.  Together, they're excellent.  The first book (Shards of Honor) deals strictly with the meeting and getting together of Cordelia Naismith and Aral Vorkosigan (Miles' parents).  As such, it ends right smack in the middle of the story.  The second book (Barrayar) picks up from there and continues through Miles' birth (with a bit of later stuff thrown in).  Thus, taken together, the two books in this compilation form one complete story and justify their issuance as a compilation.  This book (or its two components) are essential to the series and are wonderful to read.  Read them.
This was an enjoyable book to read.  It's nowhere near as deep as Bujold's other books, but it was still fun.  I think the people here who rated the book very low are going a bit overboard in comparing it to the rest of her works.  Standing on it's own, it's worth reading.  It's just that in comparison to the rest of the Vorkosigan books (i.e., the one's with Miles in them), this book suffers.  But, if you'd like to fill in a few hours with some light reading, go ahead and try this one.
This is one of my all-time favorite books.  I've read it at least half a dozen times and still love it.  Some of the terms I've carried throughout my life, like &quot;doodlehum&quot; and &quot;brace of roods,&quot; originate in this book.  The only problem I have with it is that it's just not long enough.  Zelazny could have easily fleshed this book out to at least twice its size.  There's nothing anyone can do about that, but it's still a fun, fast read.
This is a good, enjoyable book.  It's not riveting, or anything like that.  But, it's pleasing to read.  The only problems I have with it are minor.  First, the physical condition/ability of the main character varies drastically from page to page.  At one point, he'll be barely able to climb some stairs.  Yet, shortly thereafter he's able to win a fight.  Riding a horse practically knocks him out, yet later he can travel cross country at break-neck speed.  Disconcerting, but minor.  Second, the main female character is too sober and competent for her age.  Fairly early in the book, Bujold shows how she's still a youth and needs tempering and education.  Yet, within a year of the main character starting to teach her, she's better, smarter, faster, etc. than 99% of the people around her.  Nice, but not very realistic.  Finally, I could have done without the Spring/Autumn romance.  Still, overall the book was very enjoyable.
A terrible book. By page 94 (one third of the way through the book), the solution to the main mystery was obvious. This level of obviousness grew continuously throughout the remainder of the book until it was just plain embarassing. I spent two thirds of the book scratching my head, trying to figure out why Fletch, who is supposed to be brilliant, can't figure things out. There's no answer to this. Also, the ending tied to the secondary mystery is horrible. Unfortunately, there's not much I can say about it without giving it away. It's just all-around terrible and depressing. Stay away from this book.
Well, I'm glad I read this book after giving up on &quot;Carioca Fletch&quot; (hint:  stay away from that book).  This is a very good book that grabs your attention and keeps it all the way through.  The one thing I didn't like about the book (and it might just be a function of the genre and not a fault specific to the book) is that the &quot;solution&quot; to the mystery is not one that you really have any stake in finding.  Essentially, you're hit with more information at the very end of the book which gives you a surprise ending.  That aside, it's still a very good, fun book that's well worth reading.
I enjoyed reading this book.  I picked it up because Flynn was the Boston Inspector Fletch worked with/against in &quot;Confess, Fletch&quot; (a very good book).  The book is a fun, engrossing read.  But, the ending is a bit weak.  Oh, the bad guys are found out, but there's no satisfaction in it.  Various third parties clean things up once Flynn figures things out, but Flynn doesn't really get to say &quot;I told you so&quot; or to rub someone's nose in their stupidity.  Truth, Justice, and the American Way are served, but it's an intellectual service, not a visceral one.  Nevertheless, it's still a good book to read.
Essentially, this is a standard, politically correct tract that says the US, corporations, the military, and, apparently, most whites are ... and that if we all get together we'll teach the world to sing and live in perfect harmony.  In other words, it's tripe.  The premise is silly and the way they go about trying to implement the premise is jaw-droppingly stupid.  Adding insult to the injury of a bad plot is the bad writing.  The frequent switching from first person to third person is the big thing there that kept grabbing my attention.  Every time it happened, I'd back up through the pages to see if there was some reason for it.  There never was.<br />Don't bother reading this book.  It's not worth the effort.
This is my first Fletch book, and it might be my last.  I'm only half way through it, but I'm not even sure I'll finish it.  Essentially, the problem boils down to there not being any Fletch in the book.  Though he's physically present, he doesn't seem to do, say, or think anything.  Most of the book consists of McDonald going on and on and on about Brazil and the Brazilians.  Fletch just sits in the middle of it and observses their zany, wackiness (as if anyone cares).  Theoretically, there's a murder mystery here, but no one, especially not Fletch, does anything to investigate.  Looking at the other reviews here, it appears it's not just me who thinks this.  So, I'd say don't bother reading this.
I really enjoyed this book.  It's a Science Fiction Detective novel centered around the detective, his evil genius nemesis, and, for spice, an evil genius mad scientist, each in plural.  Cool.I do agree with others, though, that the ending could have been better.  First, at about 150 pages short of the end, it seems like everything's ready to be tied up.  Brin uses those extra 150 pages to escalate the evil scheme from the personal through the corporate to all humanity.  By the time you get to the actual end, you understand that.  But still, it FEELS like the book should have ended 150 pages earlier.  Also, those last 150 pages do tend to get bogged down in a lot of metaphysics.  Those are interesting, but they could have been condensed somewhat.  The very last action of the book is a bit of a letdown, though.Even though the ending could have been better, this is still a very good book to read.
I agree wholeheartedly with the review here by Phil Thwing.  Essentially, the book starts out in classic Zelaznyish fashion but suddenly shifts over to something else about half way through.  Very disappointing.  The first half is full of depth and then the second half turns shallow.  About the only good thing you can say about the ending is that it seems to tie up all the threads.  But, there's no satisfaction to it.  I wish people would stop trying top publish a dead man's unfinished works.  It just degrades his real legacy.
I loved the Night's Dawn and Mandel series and, so, was doubly disappointed with this book.  My first disappointment was when I figured out that this book had nothing to do with those books' universe.  But, the biggest problem with the book is that it reads a lot like some kind of dissertation on various political, economic, and social structures.  The various characters will be running around killing each other and destroying each other's assets and, the next thing you know, they're standing around discussing how their society is organized and the benefits/disadvantages of that.  And those discussions go on for a LOT of pages.<br />The next biggest problem with the book is that there are really no \\"good guys.\\"  The main character, though he seems to be a nice, intelligent, educated, moral, caring person, is, for all intents and purposes, a pirate.  All the space-faring corporations of Earth practice piracy as a standard business practice.  Maybe Hamilton was trying for a \\"Dread Pirate Roberts\\" (The Princess Bride) or Frederick (Pirates of Penzance), but that's not what comes across.  Instead, you left scratching your head wondering who you're supposed to be rooting for and what that apparent person is doing working for the people he does (regardless of his dreams).<br />And then, there's the ending.  For the first 600 pages, the book is hard Science Fiction.  Then, out of the blue, comes what is essentially a fairytale.  To explain what has been happening, Hamilton essentially waves his arms about and says \\"and then a miracle occurs.\\"  Extremely jarring and very disappointing.<br />I've also got problems with the amount of sex in the book.  Hamilton appears to have gone out of his way to introduce and develop characters just so his main character can have sex with them (oh, and discuss various wacko social, economic, and political theories -- for chapters on end).  Since this book is FAR too long, Hamilton could have made it at least readable by pulling all the social dissertations, sex, fairy tales, and extraneous characters out.  That would have left him with a couple of hundred pages to try to align his main character's personality with his actions.
The book's tolerable.  Essentially, the problem with it boils down to shallowness:  the characters are merely caricatures, the dialog is banal, and the plot has no depth.  If I had actually bought this book instead of borrowing it from the library, I'd probably be more upset about it.  As it is, it was just a waste of time reading it.  I find this amazing since all the other Ender/Bean books of this era are excellent.  I don't know what happened with this book, but don't bother reading it.
This is the 27th book in Pratchett's Discworld series.  Alternatively, it's the 6th book in the Watch subseries (\\"Guards! Guards,\\" \\"Men at Arms,\\" \\"Feet of Clay,\\" \\"Jingo,\\" \\"The Fifth Elephant,\\" \\"Night Watch,\\" and \\"Thud!\\").  It's a masterpiece, but, unfortunately, if you haven't read all the earlier Watch books (and, possibly, \\"Thief of Time\\"), the book will mean nothing to you.  Also, it's not a hilariously funny book (though it is funny in a darker way).  It extends the trend toward seriousness present in his other books of the Watch.  I think what Pratchett's done in this book is where he'll be going for future books:  he'll fill in the far past of his characters.  The humor will be there for other characters (like the Witches or the Wizards), but for the Watch, I think he'll maintain a more serious, darker, police-work feel with dabs of humor here and there.  Really, an excellent book that requires the background of his previous works.  I rate it at 5 stars out of 5.
This book is the very epitome of FRUSTRATION.  To paraphrase from the movie \\"Mozart:\\"  \\"too many words.\\"  If it hadn't been for Willis' excellent writing technique, I'd have given this book no more than two stars.  The theme is interesting, but the plot consists of two \\"steps forward, one step back,\\" repeated and repeated and repeated for 500 pages.  Then just when it looks like everything's going to come together, disaster strikes.  Willis then spends the next 250 pages REPEATING the same process (over and over and over again) to get to the same place.  This time, though, it's slightly quicker:  \\"THREE steps forward, one step back.\\"<br />In general, Willis obviously spends a ton of time researching her books before she writes them.  But, her writing motif seems to always be that ... (I happen to agree, so I really get sucked into her plots :) ).  No more than three people in the whole universe are helpful and everyone else actively frustrates the competent people from doing the right thing.  That's fine and dandy, but there's a limit to how much of that anyone can take.  I heartily enjoyed both \\"To Say Nothing of the Dog\\" and \\"Bellwether,\\" but \\"Doomsday Book\\" and now \\"Passage\\" just go too far (again, \\"too many words\\").<br />If you haven't read any Willis in a while, then this book is definitely fascinating.  But, if you've been reading her books sequentially, I'd suggest taking a break for a bit.  Technically excellent, thematically interesting, but plotwise:  FRUSTRATING.
This is the 25th of Pratchett's Discworld series.  Since the main characters aren't really used ever again, it's also one of the standalone books in the series (\\"Equal Rites,\\" \\"Pyramids,\\" \\"Moving Pictures,\\" \\"Small Gods,\\" \\"The Truth,\\" and \\"Monstrous Regiment\\").  It's an OK book written in good Pratchett style, but it just seems to be missing something.  I think the problem is that Pratchett took what should have been the main story (Vetinari and his troubles) and made it a secondary story in support of his new characters and their printing press.  Really, the main action SHOULD have been done by the Watch (i.e., we should have been reading this from Vimes' point of view and seeing the rise of the press secondarily).  But, alas, in this book all the members of the Watch have mere cameo appearances.  The theme, plot and humor all seem to be pretty good.  But, overall, it just doesn't click.  The book's not bad.  But, it's not great either.  I rate it at a decent 3 stars out of 5.
I'm torn about Connie Willis' &#34;[[ASIN:B004G60FXG The Doomsday Book]].&#34;  On the one hand, she obviously did a ton of research into the time period an has produced a really interesting universe with a riveting plot.  On the other hand, she tried to cram too much of her research into this book and it ended up getting in the way of the plot.  Also, her characterizations need work.  She's got two or three nicely fleshed out characters.  But, everyone else is nothing but a caricature:  she chooses one trait per character and exaggerates it past the point of belief.  In her &#34;[[ASIN:B00309SCOE To Say Nothing of the Dog]],&#34; her characters exhibit a bit of the same trait.  But, that book is much lighter than this one, and the characterizations just make for a nicer story.  This story is already dark and dreary, and her caricatures just add sand to the gears.  I'll also add that in the book's &#34;present,&#34; there's really no emotional satisfaction with how things get resolved.  Essentially, something happens that allows one of the protagonists to do what he's been trying to do for the last 400 pages or so.  Then, in the book's &#34;past,&#34; you're pretty darn sure what's going to happen, but it takes forever to get there.  Once it happens, she spends far too much time getting to the point where everything comes together.  But, I think the biggest disappointment was that she ends the book too early (yes, I know that seems to contradict my &#34;long and drawn out&#34; comment).  I can't say too much here, but just a few more footsteps and a couple of conversations to bring everyone up-to-date would have given the ending a better feel.  For the most part, I enjoyed the book.  But, the best I can rate it is an OK 3 stars out of 5.
This is the 26th of Pratchett's Discworld series.  Alternatively, you could consider it to be the 5th in the Death/Mort/Susan subseries (\\"Mort,\\" \\"Reaper Man,\\" \\"Soul Music,\\" \\"Hogfather,\\" and \\"Thief of Time\\").  I say this because Susan and Death play a very large part in the book (say, 40% of the plot).  However, the real players are Lu-Tze (seen once before in \\"Small Gods\\" (which is a fairly important book in the series, though I didn't care for it)) and his apprentice Lobsang Ludd.  This book seems to be Pratchett's attempt to have some fun with the quantum nature of space and time.  But, the best part of the book is simply Pratchett's genius at using cultural metaphors and other things we take for granted for humor and wit.    This is a wonderful book and I highly recommend it.    In my original review, I rated this book at 4 stars out of 5.  After re-reading the book, I'd like to upgrade my rating to 5 stars out of 5.  Unfortunately, I can't edit the actual rating that shows up here.
This is the 24th of Pratchett's Discworld series.  Alternatively, it's the 5th book in the Watch subseries (\\"Guards! Guards,\\" \\"Men at Arms,\\" \\"Feet of Clay,\\" \\"Jingo,\\" \\"The Fifth Elephant,\\" \\"Night Watch,\\" and \\"Thud!\\").  In this one, Pratchett uproots the Watch and has it visit Uberwald.  While there, Mr. Vimes meets and old friend of the Patrician and the family of Angua.  Like most of the other Watch books, this one's far more \\"serious\\" and deeper than standard Discword fare.  It reads more like a romantic adventure mystery than a comedy and has a very emotionally satisfying ending.  An excellent book:  5 stars out of 5.
This is the 23rd of Pratchett's Discworld series.  Alternatively, it's the 5th book in the Witches subseries (\\"Wyrd Sisters,\\" \\"Witches Abroad,\\" \\"Lords and Ladies,\\" \\"Maskerade,\\" and \\"Carpe Jugulum\\").  In this book, Pratchett's managed to re-\\"star\\" Magrat as a member of a separate, overlapping threesome of witches all while keeping her as a queen.  He also does some good development of Agnes Nitt and has provided a clever way of, possibly, strengthening or hardening her a bit.  The book's not as funny as others (the storyline is quite dark), but Shakespeare would have labeled this a Comedy.  Excellent book.  I rate it at 5 stars out of 5.
This is the 22nd of Pratchett's Discworld series.  Alternatively, it's the 6th in the Rincewind subseries (\\"The Color of Magic,\\" \\"The Light Fantastic,\\" \\"Sourcery,\\" \\"Eric,\\" \\"Interesting Times,\\" and \\"The Last Continent\\").  As is always the case, the book is a lot of fun to read.  Unfortunately, the storyline is a bit shallow.  Essentially, there's very little development of a plot.  In the major storyline, Rincewind is supposed to do something to save XXXX.  But, there's really no progress towards it through 99% of the book (besides the obvious progress of putting one foot in front of the other).  Basically, the major plotline of the book consists of Rincewind running through various unrelated aspects of Australia, and then getting drunk and fixing everything.  The secondary storyline is not much better.  Reading about the wizards bickering amongst themselves is fun, but after a while you notice that that's ALL it is.  Nothing really happens, and they sure don't solve anything themselves.  They're essentially a mechanism to introduce a twist in the Rincewind line.  For light entertainment, the book is fine.  But, for an engrossing plot, it's not really worth it.  I rate the book as merely an OK 3 stars out of 5.
This is the 21st of Pratchett's Discworld series.  Alternatively, it's the 4th book in the Watch subseries (\\"Guards! Guards,\\" \\"Men at Arms,\\" \\"Feet of Clay,\\" \\"Jingo,\\" \\"The Fifth Elephant,\\" \\"Night Watch,\\" and \\"Thud!\\").  Like all his books, this one has a very lively, funny, and tongue-in-cheek plot and narrative.  Unfortunately, the very theme of the book forces me to downgrade it to only 3 stars.  The title of the book tells it all:  Jingo.  According to Webster, that's \\"a person who boasts of his patriotism and favors an aggressive, threatening, warlike foreign policy; chauvinist....\\"  Essentially, this is an anti-military, anti-nationalism book.  It's an interesting thing that throughout Pratchett's novels, various groups of people have formed into guilds.  Assassins, thieves, beggers, prostitutes (heck, even stray dogs), etc. all have guilds and, in general, the membership of those guilds are very competent at what they do.  Indeed, not only are these people competent, but the very existence of those guilds is considered to be a GOOD thing (in an Ankh-Morporkian way).  However, there's no military guild.  Almost every instance of military thought or use in this book is something held up as a matter of ridicule.  There are no competent military men (well, perhaps one Lieutenant).  And the military is always considered to be a BAD thing.  Ditto for nationalism.  This is a very strange mindset that almost ruins the book.  If you subscribe to the same mindset, or if you can work around it for a bit, this is a very good book.  But, unfortunately, I found it disconcerting (to say the least).  I rate it at merely an OK 3 stars out of 5.
This is the 20th in Pratchett's Discworld series.  In general, it's a book about Death.  But, more correctly, it's a book centering on Susan.  Specifically, it's the 4th in the Death/Mort/Susan subseries (\\"Mort,\\" \\"Reaper Man,\\" \\"Soul Music,\\" \\"Hogfather,\\" and \\"Thief of Time\\").  As in \\"Soul Music,\\" Susan is once again \\"teamed\\" with the Death of Rats and the raven to solve a problem while Death is busy elsewhere (though for a very different reason this time).  Along with the main plot, Pratchett also does a good bit of development on the Unseen University's Hex.  The wizards, too, get a big slice of the book as a \\"comedy relief\\" for Susan's \\"serious\\" outlook on life.  One detail that bothered me, though, was that at the end of \\"Soul Music,\\" Susan was supposedly getting together with Buddy.  He's entirely missing from this book (not just missing -- it's like he never existed at all).  But, other than that, a very good book with a very interesting plot and a lot of funny moments.  I rate it at 4 stars out of 5.
This is the 19th of Pratchett's Discworld series.  Alternatively, it's the 4th book in the Witches subseries (\\"Wyrd Sisters,\\" \\"Witches Abroad,\\" \\"Lords and Ladies,\\" \\"Maskerade,\\" and \\"Carpe Jugulum\\").  In this book, Pratchett uses the \\"Phantom of the Opera\\" as the basis for his plot.  The main character (outside of Granny Weatherwax and Nanny Ogg) is Agnes (Perdita X.) Nitt, who had a cameo role in \\"Lords and Ladies.\\"  With a lot of adventure, murder, mystery, and comedy, Pratchett manages to set her up as a replacement for Magrat in the coven.  An amusing sub-plot is how Nanny manipulates Granny (whom she's worried about) into the main plot.  Though it works, this, not surprisingly, fairly quickly boomerangs on her.  This book has oodles of those passages where you burst out laughing while reading and just have to tell your spousal unit while she's busy trying to do something else.  An essential, excellent book.  Read it:  5 stars out of 5.
This is the 18th of Pratchett's Discworld series.  Alternatively, it's the 5th in the Rincewind subseries (\\"The Color of Magic,\\" \\"The Light Fantastic,\\" \\"Sourcery,\\" \\"Eric,\\" \\"Interesting Times,\\" and \\"The Last Continent\\").  It once again brings back Rincewind and re-unites him with Cohen and Twoflower (though Twoflower's role is practically a cameo).  Pratchett does an excellent job of intertwining the two multiply-intersecting storylines centering around Cohen and Rincewind.  The recurring motifs of potatoes (I almost died while Rincewind was on his desert isle and thought some beautiful women were offering him potatoes) and \\"Aaargh\\" were hilarious, so pay attention when they're introduced.  The book fleshes out Cohen's character a bit more and does some more development of the Unseen University's \\"Hex.\\"  Very good book.  I rate it at 4 stars out of 5.
This is the 17th in Pratchett's Discworld series.  Alternatively, it's the 3rd book in the Watch subseries (&#34;Guards! Guards,&#34; &#34;Men at Arms,&#34; &#34;Feet of Clay,&#34; &#34;Jingo,&#34; &#34;The Fifth Elephant,&#34; &#34;Night Watch,&#34; and &#34;Thud!&#34;).  In this book, Pratchett uses the continuing development of the Watch to produce more of a Mystery novel than usual (and poke fun at the genre at the same time).  In the process, he introduces a new race of creatures, gives Carrot girl problems, increases the visibility of Nobby, and starts a bit of an upheaval in Dwarf circles with Corporal Littlebottom.  An excellent book:  5 stars out of 5.
This is the 16th in Pratchett's Discworld series.  Alternatively, it's the 3rd in the Death/Mort/Susan subseries (\\"Mort,\\" \\"Reaper Man,\\" \\"Soul Music,\\" \\"Hogfather,\\" and \\"Thief of Time\\"). I'm torn between giving it a four or a five star rating.  I really enjoyed the book and there are a lot of really funny things that make you laugh out loud when you read it.  But, something seems to be missing.  The best I can come up with is the lack of some character development and a minor quibble with a motive.  For character development, I think Pratchett could have done some more with both Susan and with \\"Buddy.\\"  Susan doesn't seem to grow much with the plot.  She starts out one way and essentially ends up the same way.  \\"Buddy,\\" on the other hand, gets hardly any character development at all.  Even though he's one of the main characters, he's pretty much of a blank throughout the book.  My quibble with a motive is that the reason Death is trying to forget isn't clearly explained.  I'm 99% certain it has to do with a couple of deaths he had to oversee, but he keeps talking about bony knees (which would apply to someone else).  Other than that, this is a very good book with a lot of good humor.
This is the 15th in Pratchett's Discworld series.  Alternatively, it's the 2nd book in the Watch subseries (\\"Guards! Guards,\\" \\"Men at Arms,\\" \\"Feet of Clay,\\" \\"Jingo,\\" \\"The Fifth Elephant,\\" \\"Night Watch,\\" and \\"Thud!\\").  In this book, Pratchett does a multi-cultural transformation of the Watch, transitions Vimes from a Captain to a Mr., and, one way or another, brings Carrot into his own.  The book also introduces Angua and \\"fleshes out\\" (as it were) Detritus a bit more.  The book is so good that I kept trying to read it faster and faster just so I could see what was going to happen next (and I've read the book several times now :) ).  Excellent book and an essential one to the series.  5 stars out of 5.
This is the 14th of Pratchett's Discworld series.  Alternatively, it's the 3rd book in the Witches subseries (\\"Wyrd Sisters,\\" \\"Witches Abroad,\\" \\"Lords and Ladies,\\" \\"Maskerade,\\" and \\"Carpe Jugulum\\").  It picks up practically where the last Witches book (\\"Witches Abroad\\") left off (arriving back from their trip abroad).  This book is based on Shakespeare's \\"A Midsummer Night's Dream.\\"  What's nice about this book is the linkage between the Witches and the Wizards.  Along with Granny, Nanny, and Magrat, a good part of the book is based on Arch-Chancellor Ridcully's and Granny's youth.  There's also some work with the Librarian, Ponder Stibbons and the-now-medicated Bursar.  Also, this is Magrat's swan song.  The book's not quite as good as \\"Witches Abroad,\\" but I still had tears in my eyes from laughing so much.  Excellent book:  5 stars out of 5.
This is the 12th of Pratchett's Discworld series.  Alternatively, it's the 2nd book in the Witches subseries (\\"Wyrd Sisters,\\" \\"Witches Abroad,\\" \\"Lords and Ladies,\\" \\"Maskerade,\\" and \\"Carpe Jugulum\\").  It's one of the very best (at least on par with \\"Reaper Man,\\" and maybe even a tad bit better).  Obviously, this book centers around Granny Weatherwax, Nanny Ogg, and Magrat Garlick.  Pratchett uses the actual concept of fairy tales as his template.  His main fairy tale is Cinderella.  But, he brings many others in:  \\"Snow White,\\" \\"The Three Little Pigs,\\" \\"Little Red Riding Hood.\\"  He's even got references to \\"The Hobbit\\" and \\"The Wizard of Oz.\\"  As always, the interesting relationship between Granny and Nanny is hilarious.  As an added bonus, in this book, Pratchett's given quite a bit of emphasis to Grebo (Nanny's cat (who deserves a book all of his own)).  This is a must-read book, especially if you're a fan of Granny, Nanny, and Magrat:  5 stars out of 5.
This is the 13th in Pratchett's Discworld series.  It's also, technically, a stand-alone book (like \\"Equal Rites,\\" \\"Pyramids,\\" \\"Moving Pictures,\\" \\"Small Gods,\\" \\"The Truth,\\" and \\"Monstrous Regiment\\").  The main character doesn't show up anywhere else in the series, but a secondary character, Lu-Tze, does.  Also, the main thrust of the plot is fairly important in a few later books.  You could probably pick this book up without having read any other Pratchett.  But, I wouldn't recommend skipping it (regardless of my mere 3 star rating).    Normally, I love anything by Pratchett.  But, this book's a poser.  It's VERY well written in good Pratchett style.  It has a good plot, good theme, and a few nice twists and turns.  My problem with the book is that it's not \\"nice.\\"  In fact, it's depressing.  The prevalence of rot and evil that the main character has to fight makes my stomache churn.  I read Pratchett to lighten my life.  This book doesn't do that.  Technically, it's a VERY good book.  I just don't like the subject material.  Splitting the difference, I can only give it a rating of 3 stars out of 5.
This is the second Connie Willis book I've read (the first being &quot;To Say Nothing of the Dog&quot;).  Like that other book, this is just amazing.  Essentially, the book is a mixture of Dilbert-on-steroids, science, history, history of science, humor, and romance.  Also like that other book, this one has an underlying theme of the importance of coincidence in our world.  Excellent book.  Definitely read it.
I don't agree with the Reading Level assigned to this book (ages 9-12). Sure, 9-12 year olds could read it without problem. But, it's not a really a kid's book. It's just a very, very good book that's fun and light to read. It's also almost entirely independent of any need for prior knowledge of the Discworld. At a guess, I'd assign it a place just after \\"Moving Pictures\\" (purely based on the \\"Gaspode-the-Wonder-Dog\\" affect plus the fact that Maurice is mentioned twice in \\"Reaper Man\\" (which comes just after \\"Moving Pictures\\")). It's definitely a book to read. Anyone CAN read it and everyone SHOULD read it.
An amazing book.  Essentially, it can be summed up with:  &quot;The best-laid schemes o' mice an 'men. Gang aft agley.&quot;  From the second you pick it up, you're caught up in it just as though you were the protagonist.  Action.  Mystery.  Romance.  Time-travel.  Even bits of History and Culture.  All of it set in a book you just can't put down.  I don't know why I'd never run across Connie Willis' books before, but I'm going to get her others now.  Amazing book.
This is the 10th in Pratchett's Discworld.  Since neither of the main characters (Victor and Theda (\\"Ginger\\")) are ever referenced in any other Discworld books, this is one of the \\"standalone\\" books in the series (\\"Equal Rites,\\" \\"Pyramids,\\" \\"Moving Pictures,\\" \\"Small Gods,\\" \\"The Truth,\\" and \\"Monstrous Regiment\\").  It's also one of the excellent ones.  As the name implies, it's a parody of Hollywood during its Golden Age.  Since Pratchett's forte is working with cultural metaphors, and Hollywood is a prime source of such metaphors, Pratchett is at his best here.  The way the material and various films tie together (especially in the last 100 pages or so) is hilarious.  Plus, the book does some good development of C.M.O.T. Dibbler and Detritus.  It also introduces Ridcully, the Archancellor who seems to be Pratchett's now-permanent one, and one of my favorite recurring characters:  Gaspode.  Excellent book.  I rate it at 5 stars out of 5.
This is the 9th in Pratchett's Discworld series.  Alternatively, it's the 4th in the Rincewind subseries (\\"The Color of Magic,\\" \\"The Light Fantastic,\\" \\"Sourcery,\\" \\"Eric,\\" \\"Interesting Times,\\" and \\"The Last Continent\\").  The book is merely OK.  It's a fun, short read, but has a very shallow, linear plot.  Its sole purpose is to be a vehicle for the return of Rincewind.  There's nothing wrong with that, per se, but it's just too short to have any depth.  The version I have is 197 pages long, whereas these books normally run around 250 pages long.  That doesn't sound too bad until you look at some of the typographic tricks the publisher uses to stretch the apparent size of the book:  they use a bigger type face than normal, use one-and-one-half line spacing instead of single-spacing, and then increase the margin sizes.  All in all, I'd estimate this book to be equivalent to about 100 pages:  merely a short-story -- a novella at best.    Mostly because of its length (or lack thereof), I give this book a merely OK 3 stars out of 5.  If you skipped it entirely, you'd really miss nothing of the series except the actual mechanism of how Rincewind gets back.
This is the 7th in Pratchett's Discworld series.  Essentially, it stands on its own (like \\"Equal Rites,\\" \\"Pyramids,\\" \\"Moving Pictures,\\" \\"Small Gods,\\" \\"The Truth,\\" and \\"Monstrous Regiment\\").  Outside of a general knowledge of the Discworld, you don't need to have read any of the earlier books and, since none of the characters or events are ever referenced in any other Discworld books, you won't miss anything if you skip it.  However, since it's such a good book, I wouldn't recommend that.  It's not one of the greats of the Discworld series.  But, it's still very enjoyable and entertaining to read.  I rate it at 4 stars out of 5.
As I write this review, this book is showing an average rating of 4 stars.  I have no idea how that can be.  The premise is interesting:  a SciFi interpretation of the creation of Heaven and Earth and the Fall.  But, you can just feel the author trying to cram the plot in to fit the established framework.  There's also almost nothing in the book which talks about WHY the characters are acting as they do.  Mostly, it's about WHAT they do and isn't it clever how it meshes with the accepted interpretation.  Since most of what the characters are doing is pretty sophomoric, having a better idea of their motivations is essential.  Some of the anthropomorphisms are absurd, too (i.e., assuming pre-Earth angels would act as we do, make things of steel, and light their homes with torches is ridiculous).    Since I rate this book at a mere 2 stars out of 5, I'd say that if you want to read it, get it from the library and save yourself a bundle.
This is the first in Pratchett's Discworld series (one of the best series of books ever written).  As such, it's an absolute MUST READ for everyone.  Unfortunately, the book isn't one of the excellent ones in the series.  It's nowhere near being a bad book.  It's just not an excellent one.  It's OK.  Along with being the first in the whole series, this book is also the first in the Rincewind subseries (&#34;The Color of Magic,&#34; &#34;The Light Fantastic,&#34; &#34;Sourcery,&#34; &#34;Eric,&#34; &#34;Interesting Times,&#34; and &#34;The Last Continent&#34;).  Since Rincewind and the Luggage are recurring motifs in the series, you definitely have to read this.  I rate this book at an OK 3 stars out of 5 (the series, as a whole, would get 5 out of 5).
This is the 2nd book in Pratchett's Discworld.  Alternatively, it's also the 2nd in the Rincewind subseries (\\"The Color of Magic,\\" \\"The Light Fantastic,\\" \\"Sourcery,\\" \\"Eric,\\" \\"Interesting Times,\\" and \\"The Last Continent\\").  It picks up immediately after the \\"cliff-hanger\\" of \\"The Color of Magic,\\" but is a far better book (it's a coherent whole instead of several short bits strung together).  It's extremely interesting to read this book after having read the entire series (several times), since you notice all the little embryonic ideas Pratchett has for development in later books.  Also, you can see how his concept of the Discworld changes over time.  I rate this book at 4 stars out of 5.
This is the 8th in Pratchett's Discworld.  Alternatively, it's the 1st book in the Watch subseries (\\"Guards! Guards,\\" \\"Men at Arms,\\" \\"Feet of Clay,\\" \\"Jingo,\\" \\"The Fifth Elephant,\\" \\"Night Watch,\\" and \\"Thud!\\").  An excellent book which introduces the Watch (specifically, and most importantly, Carrot and Vimes).  It also fleshes out both the Librarian and the Patrician some more.  All of these become very important in later books, so reading this one is not only great fun, it's also essential to the series.  I rate it at 5 stars out of 5.
This is Pratchett's 5th in the Discworld series.  Alternatively, it's the 3rd in the Rincewind subseries (\\"The Color of Magic,\\" \\"The Light Fantastic,\\" \\"Sourcery,\\" \\"Eric,\\" \\"Interesting Times,\\" and \\"The Last Continent\\").  I'd say that this book, along with \\"Interesting Times,\\" are the best of the Rincewind set.  A couple of disconcerting things about the book are that 1) even though the prequel, \\"The Light Fantastic\\" has Rincewind saving the Discworld, this book starts off with no reference to it (and with a severe, though not unexpected, lowering of what Rincewind's status should be), and 2) the book doesn't end all that pleasantly for Rincewind and the Luggage.  Even so, this is a very good book that I rate at 4 stars out of 5.
\\"Mort\\" is the 4th Discworld novel.  Alternatively, it's the 1st in the Death/Mort/Susan subseries (\\"Mort,\\" \\"Reaper Man,\\" \\"Soul Music,\\" \\"Hogfather,\\" and \\"Thief of Time\\").  It's also the best of the series up to that point.  An excellent book with some of the best writing I've ever read.  In this book, Pratchett develops Death and transforms him from a flat, cameo-like persona to a recurring, fairly central, far-more-LIFE-like role.  Wonderful book.
This is a tough book to review.  It's a consolidation of the two separate Amber series (call them the Corwin series and the Merlin series).  As a consolidation, it's a wonderful thing to have.  I much prefer having the one big book to having 10 different books that I have to keep in order.  The tough part of this review is that I absolutely love the Corwin series.  I first read it decades ago.  Loved it then, and love it now.  The problem is that the end is not satisfactory.  When the Merlin series came out, I had hoped that it would fix that ending.  To some small extent, it does.  But mostly, it goes about its own business.  Plus, it doesn't even end its own side nicely.  I rate the Merlin series as only OK (say, three stars).  Thus, my overall four star rating.  The Corwin series is an absolute must read.  A Classic.  Even though the Merlin series is not as good, the overall compilation is something everyone should have.
This is the first of a train of excellent books (In Conquest Born, The Madness Season, Black Sun Rising, When True Night Falls, and Crown of Shadows) by C. S. Friedman.  All of these books are very different from each other.  This is pure science fiction, The Madness Season is mostly science fiction with generous doses of several other genres, and the Coldfire Trilogy is mostly fantasy with a smattering of science fiction.  All excellent.  This book can probably be best summarized by a passage on page 276:<br />&quot;The ancient Braxana would have valued such an enmity.  They had created elaborate rituals to formalize the confrontation of equals, in order to increase its destructive/constructive power.  Such rituals hadn't been used in centuries, perhaps millennia.  No k'airth had existed since the Braxana warriors left their native steppes and were absorbed by civilization; in the complexity of modern society, paired enmity had ceased to be valued.  Until now.&quot;
How to describe this book?  Perhaps as Sci-Fi?  How about Occult?  Aliens take over the world?  Psychological exploration?  Romance?  All of those (and more) apply.  This is a wonderful book that has you *scratching* your head trying to figure out what's going on for the first 75 pages and then has you *slapping* your head over the feeling that you should have known. And from there, it keeps on getting better.  One of my favorite books.
This ending has a lot of unexpected twists.  It's not just a linear &quot;solution&quot; to the problem set up in the previous books.  From the first chapter on, we're presented with whole new twists which tie together very nicely to provide something totally new from the ending.  As a hint, one of those twists has a lot in common with the standard, &quot;surprise&quot; at the end of the old Might &amp; Magic games.  An excellent ending to an excellent trilogy.
Like the first book of this series, this is about good vs evil with the two bound together for their own reasons.  The conflict engendered by this is extremely interesting.  The only reason I gave this four stars instead of five, was that I think it runs a tad long.  This is the third time I've read the book, so maybe I'm just getting overly familiar with it.  But, I'd say a lot of the &quot;wandering in the wilderness&quot; parts of it could be trimmed a bit.  Other than that, great.
This excellent book is the first of a trilogy.  It's the start of a good vs evil tale.  But, in this case, not only is good pitted against evil, it's also bound to evil.  Both are trying to accomplish their own goals:  one for love, the other for survival.  By the end of the book, this morphs into something much bigger (which is taken up by the second in the series).  Excellent book.
John Varley's \\"The Golden Globe\\" isn't exactly a sequel to \\"Steel Beach.\\" It's sort of a follow on. Part of it takes place before and during the time of \\"Steel Beach,\\" while most of it takes place afterwards. The vast majority of the book happens elsewhere, though. With that out of the way, it's still a good book. I think I prefer \\"Steel Beach\\" to it.  But, it's a close call. \\"The Golden Globe\\" revolves far less around sex and the decadence of the society and more around one person and his flight from his own life. It's a big book and isn't exactly an easy read. But, still, it's worth the time.  I rate it at a Very Good 4 stars out of 5.<br /><br />The novels in John Varley's \\"Eight Worlds\\" universe are:<br /><br />1.  [[ASIN:B00AFXMAC8 The Ophiuchi Hotline]]<br />2.  [[ASIN:0441785654 Steel Beach]]<br />3.  [[ASIN:B00AFVTSGG The Golden Globe]]
This is the 3rd in Pratchett's Discworld series.  First off, after having read through the whole series several times now (this time sorted by the main characters instead of chronologically), I definitely have to raise my rating of this book from 3 stars to 4 stars out of 5.  Secondly, classifying this book by main character is a bit of a poser.  You could make a case for it being the 1st book in the Witches subseries (\\"Wyrd Sisters,\\" \\"Witches Abroad,\\" \\"Lords and Ladies,\\" \\"Maskerade,\\" and \\"Carpe Jugulum\\") since it introduces Granny Weatherwax.  But, since most of it is really written from the viewpoint of Eskarina and Granny really isn't as magnificently deep as she will become in later books, I'll have to keep this book as one of the standalone books (\\"Equal Rites,\\" \\"Pyramids,\\" \\"Moving Pictures,\\" \\"Small Gods,\\" \\"The Truth,\\" and \\"Monstrous Regiment\\").  This is especially true since Eskarina is never seen, heard, nor referenced in any later books.  Also, in my previous version of this review, I wrote that you really wouldn't miss anything by skipping over the book.  Once again, I find that I was wrong.  With this reading, I've noticed that there are an awful lot of central, recurring Discworld (and particularly \\"The Witches\\") themes that happen in this book first.  So, I'll have to say that \\"Equal Rites\\" is an essential book to the series and is very good, to boot:  4 stars out of 5.
This is the 6th book in Pratchett's Discworld series.  Alternatively, it's the 1st book in the Witches subseries (\\"Wyrd Sisters,\\" \\"Witches Abroad,\\" \\"Lords and Ladies,\\" \\"Maskerade,\\" and \\"Carpe Jugulum\\" -- though Granny Weatherwax did have a role in \\"Equal Rites\\" (which preceded this)).  Take the essence of Macbeth, give it a twist, sprinkle it with hilarious characters, dialog, and situations, and then throw in several parallel structures.  Shake well.  You've got one of the best books ever written by anyone, anywhere (this book).  It's a tough book to read because my eyes repeatedly filled with tears from laughing so much:  5 stars out of 5.
I love John Varley's \\"Steel Beach\\" (I've read it three times now), but I still find that there's too much sex in it. I understand why he's got it there (a bored society), but I just don't want a sci-fi book with a sexual theme. If you pull out that, then this book is a classic. It's written in a very Heinleinish way (of course the more recent Heinlein books all revolved around sex, too). It takes a lot from Heinlein's \\"The Moon is a Harsh Mistress.\\" Wonderful book, fun to read, but don't give it to the kids.  I rate it at a Very Good 4 stars out of 5.<br /><br />The novels in John Varley's \\"Eight Worlds\\" universe are:<br /><br />1.  [[ASIN:B00AFXMAC8 The Ophiuchi Hotline]]<br />2.

First, I gave Sozhenitsyn's \\"Gulag Archipelago\\" a 4 star rating because of the style of its writing. Content-wise, this book is far beyond even a 5 star rating. As my title says, it should be mandatory reading for everyone in this country.  Regarding the style, the best I can say is it's very Russian. Solzhenitsyn uses tons of well-researched details to present his thesis. The only problem is that after a while it gets depressing. Also, he uses a heck of a lot of scathing sarcasm throughout the book. So much so, that you start to become numb to it. This isn't necessarily a bad thing, but you should be aware that this is NOT a novel. Also, it's not really a history. As the subtitle on the title page says, it's \\"An Experiment in Literary Investigation.\\" Personally, I'd have been more satisfied with a history.  The content of this book is simply inconceivable and far outweighs my minor criticisms of the style. It describes how the Communists in the Soviet Union consciously tortured and murdered millions (if not tens of millions) of their own people. With this book in print, I can't understand how anyone could ever say anything good about Communism.  It's a long book, but READ IT.  I rate it at a Very Good 4 stars out of 5.
The book \\"Dave Barry is Not Taking This Sitting Down\\" is good, solid Dave Barry. There are a few really good chapters (articles), but most of them are just standard Barry fare (which is good).  I rate it at an OK 3 stars out of 5.
Or, maybe it's an \\"Excellent Look at Capitalism from a Freedom Point of View.\\" In either case, Milton Friedman's \\"Capitalism and Freedom\\" is a very interesting book. In the first two chapters, he summarizes the principles for everything else in the book. The remaining chapters are specific applications of these principles.  Even though the book was originally written in 1962, his analyses of these situations are real eye-openers. Everything's written for reasonably normal human beings: no math or anything special required.  I rate it at an Excellent 5 stars out of 5.
The ending of Douglas Adams' \\"Mostly Harmless\\" was so bad that I vowed never to read another of his books. Adams was obviously sick and tired of the series and used this book to kill it off with absolutely no chance of its ever returning. If you liked the other books in this series, don't go anywhere near this one. I rate it at a terrible 1 star out of 5.<br /><br />The books in Douglas Adams' \\"Hitchhiker's Guide to the Galaxy\\" series are:<br /><br />1.

C.S. Lewis' \\"The Abolition of Man\\" is a fairly short, interesting piece of logic that extrapolates from an early instance of \\"Innovation\\" (an Innovator in this book is someone who wants to \\"improve\\" us by removing the innate morality from certain things) out to the extinction of mankind (hence the title).  From a single example of a new school book, he foretells exactly what will happen (and we're pretty far down that path already) to mankind via the educational establishment.  The basic thrust of the book is that if we remove the concept of innate goodness or badness in things and replace it with how we feel about those things, we lose the underpinnings that keep us human.  A very short book, but a very good one.  I rate it at a Very Good 4 stars out of 5.
Glen Cook's \\"Faded Steel Heat\\" is the 9th in his Garrett series. As are all of Glen Cook's books with the title format of [adjective][metal type][noun], this is an interesting, fun, action-packed read. It's definitely a page-turner. Unfortunately, the minor inconsistencies I noticed in the previous book seem to be propagating in this one. Some of these errors are merely editing or lack of note-checking. For instance, near the beginning of this book, Garrett's talking to CAPTAIN Block. But, from two books back, we know that Block was promoted to COLONEL. A hundred pages on, though, Cook's got Block back as a COLONEL. In another case, Garrett's looking at a captured wagon. He specifically notes ONE prisoner. A couple pages later there are TWO prisoners. One page later, THREE. More seriously, there are behavioral problems. For instance, Garrett and his harem can't keep their minds on their business. In earlier books, Garrett's womanizing didn't really interfere in his business. In this book, both he and the women just stop working on important things (like infiltrations, kidnappings and murder) for a little bit of groping. And I mean they stop right in the middle of those things: not afterwards. Also, Garrett just misses obvious clues. He narrates to us about them, but nothing apparently clicks in his head. And then there's where he takes Tinnie with him to visit the headquarters of The Call (a militant human rights group). But, as noted in earlier books, Tinnie is part elf. Nobody ever notices.<br />These problems are still minor. This is definitely a book to read (along with all the rest of the series). But, because of these discrepancies, I've lowered my rating for the book to a mere OK 3 stars out of 5.<br /><br />The books in Cook's \\"Garrett\\" series are:<br /><br />1.

I got halfway through Paul J. McAuley's \\"The Secret of Life\\" before giving up on it. If you want to read different philosophies of scientific direction and human behavior, this is the book for you. If you want to actually read a story that might entertain, look elsewhere. I rate it at a Pretty Bad 2 stars out of 5.
This an excellent book.  Basically, the whole point of it is to mathematically define what a computer is and prove that it works.  The author does this by defining and manipulating mathematical alphabets and languages without resorting to any kind of advanced math.  Starting from nothing, the whole thing leads up to Turing Machines.  More specifically, according to the Preface, the goals of the book are:     \\"(1) to introduce a student of Computer Science to the need for and the working of mathematical proof; (2) to develop facility  with the concepts, notations, and techniques of the theories of Automata, Formal Languages, and Turing machines; and (3) to provide historical perspective on the creation of the computer with a profound understanding of some of its capabilities and limitations.\\"    The author did a wonderful job of it.  Plus, unlike almost all other computer/math books I've read, this book is almost enjoyable to read.  Again, as stated in the Preface:     \\"This book is written for students with no presumed background of any kind.  Every mathematical concept used is introduced from scratch.  Extensive examples and illustrations spell out everything in detail to avoid any possibility of confusion.\\"    Astonishingly, those are all true statements.  At a guess, I'd say that almost anyone interested in computers could get through this book without undue stress.  To make it more meaningful, I'd suggest (only suggest) prerequisites of having programmed a computer and knowing some discrete math.  From that point of view, it's odd that as of last year, this book was used in Florida State University's (FSU's) COT 4420: \\"Theory of Computation\\" course, which, obviously, is a 4000 level course requiring various prerequisites that put it out of the reach of all but senior (or graduate) level students.    Now, with all that glowing out of the way, there are a couple of small problems with the book.  The first is simply that the exercises don't have any solutions.  Forthe self-studyer, that's a bad thing.  In a school teaching environment, it's probably acceptable, though.  The second problem is that after getting through the book, I simply have to ask: \\"So what?  WHY should I learn this?\\"  Again, in the Preface, the author states:    \\"Leaving aside the obvious worth of knowledge for its own sake, the terminology, notations, and techniques of Computer Theory are necessary in the teaching of courses on computer design, Artificial Intelligence, the analysis of algorithms, and so forth.  Of all the programming skills undergraduate students learn, two of the most important are the abilities to recognize and manipulate context-free grammars and to understand the power of the recursive interaction of parts of a procedure.  Very little can be accomplished if each advanced course has to begin at the level of defining rules of production and derivations.\\"    But, in my experience, I have to say that except for one reference in one other book I've read, I've never seen any of this stuff used.  Even more, I've never known anyone who even knew of anyone who used (or even knew of) any of it.  EVERYTHING has been done at a much higher level of abstraction than alphabets, languages, and various levels of algorithms and machines up to Turing Machines.  I'm not saying that the material in this book isn't used SOMEWHERE.  But, I'd honestly have liked to have seen actual, specific, concrete cases:  they'd be fascinating.      So, factoring those two nits in, I rate this book at 4 stars out of 5.  If those two things don't bother you, then you could easily consider this a 5 star book.
This is the 11th in Pratchett's Discworld series.  Alternatively, it's the 2nd in the Death/Mort/Susan subseries (\\"Mort,\\" \\"Reaper Man,\\" \\"Soul Music,\\" \\"Hogfather,\\" and \\"Thief of Time\\").  It's an excellent continuation of the \\"fleshing\\" out of Death that Pratchett began with \\"Mort\\" (though \\"Mort\\" focused more on Death's apprentice).  Although a good chunk of this book could be considered as a part of the Wizards subseries, Death is really the main player here.  This is a highly enjoyable, very satisfying book to read.  I rate it at 5 stars out of 5.
This is an excellent, very readable history of cryptography.  It's very interesting to read, and requires no math or any special linguistic ability.  It nicely summarizes what cryptography is and what it's about.  I rate it at 5 stars out of 5.
First, the good part:  this book is an intellectual and academic masterpiece.  It would be great for people doing algorithm or other Computer Science research.  It's an amazing synthesis of much of the core of a Computer Science degree with Discrete Math and Probability.  Oddly, it's more like a math book than a CS book. <br /> <br />Now, the not so good part:  for implementers (i.e., programmers), this book is not all that useful.  The biggest technical negative is that, for the most part, the authors ignore memory hierarchies and treat everything as if it were running on a computer with infinite cache memory and having everything already loaded there.  Granted, the authors spend a huge chunk of time teaching the readers how to do (and prove) cost (or efficiency) analysis on algorithms.  So, readers should be able to figure out actual, real-world efficiencies on their own (although there's nothing in this book to illustrate how to modify the analysis to do that).  But, since memory hierarchies drastically change the relative efficiencies of algorithms, they should be considered in the original algorithmic analysis and ranking. <br /> <br />From a methodology point of view, another problem is that the authors assume the readers have full knowledge of the algorithms covered in the book.  In general, they don't even try to teach the actual algorithms, how they came about, the reasoning behind them, or any method of thought for coming up with other, similar, algorithms.  Instead, the authors merely focus on proving the correctness and cost of the pre-existing algorithms.  It's like the authors present a beautiful, theoretical, shiny structure sparkling and spinning in the ether.  They then explain what parts make up this structure, how they're put together, and how long it takes to use such a structure.  But, what would be far more useful is if the authors started from the more common position where someone has a problem and a big pile of parts.  They need to know howto determine the best thing to make from all those parts to fix the problem, and how to put it together in the most efficient way.  Essentially, it's the difference between a reference book and a teaching book. <br /> <br />On the level of irritations, the authors leave a LOT of core stuff as exercises for the student.  This is bad enough on its own (and is one of my pet peeves in the math world).  However, making this even worse is the fact that NONE of the exercises are answered.  So, firstly, that makes these exercises useless to self-studyers (i.e., me).  And, secondly, that makes the \\"proof is left as an exercise to the student\\" core parts of the book entirely inaccesible to self-studyers. <br /> <br />I can't emphasize enough that academically and intellectually, the scope and depth of this book is amazing.  If I were someone doing pure research in computer science algorithms, I'd rate it at 5 stars out of 5.  But, as a lowly nouveaux-programmer trying to improve my mind, the best I can give it is an OK 3 stars out of 5.
Overall, this is a very satisfying book to read.  It's a quasi-sequel to Bujold's \\"The Curse of Chalion\\" in that it the events happen after \\"Chalion\\" and there's a common character, but neither book really depends on the other (though I highly recommend reading \\"Chalion\\" first to get the most out of this book).  Even though I was very happy with it, this book does have some problems.  First, the main character matures an awful lot for the little experience she's getting.  It's satisfying, but you feel like there's a disconnect between the starting character and the ending one.  Second, the enemy in the book has a tendency to just appear whenever convenient to Bujold.  There's really no explanation (or possibility) for these multiple, massive incursions.  And finally, Bujold places all her emphasis on the personal level and almost none on the social or political levels.  Again, this leads to a comfortable romance novel, but the potential was there for a much more interesting book. <br /> <br />Overall, regardless of it's faults, this book is a light, comfortable read.  I give it a good 4 stars out of 5.
Though the main plotline (or two) of this massive book is somewhat interesting, Hamilton has just put too much extraneous stuff into it.  Specifically, he has too many characters, goes into far to much detail for much of what he describes and has several irrelevant plotlines running.  Admittedly, this is only the first book in the series (which is irritating in itself since there was no indication that this was a series until the cliff-hanger \\"ending\\"), so some of the \\"irrelevancies\\" might turn out to be crucial in the later book(s).  But, there's something wrong when it takes several hundred pages for him to cycle through his main characters' storylines just once and introduce them.  I spent a good portion of the book just trying to figure out if I already knew a character and what, if anything, he or she had to do with the story.  Also, without all the window-dressing, Hamilton probably could have fit the whole story into this one volume.  It's a shame, since the writing is good.  But, by the time I hit the last hundred pages, I was just skimming the text:  nothing was really happening to move the plot forward and after six or seven hundred pages, who needs more character development?  If the book were \\"lighter\\" (easier to read), I'd probably raise my rating a star.  But, as is, I'll have to give it just an OK 3 stars out of 5.
For years, I've suffered from the occasional bout of \\"try to figure out Linux\\" mania.  So, I've repeatedly downloaded and installed various flavors of the OS and tried to work with them for a while.  I invariably ended up throwing my hands up in despair because I couldn't find a Rosetta stone to decipher the Linux community's secret language and arcana.  Since the previous editions of this book seem to have good reviews and because this version comes with a DVD with the latest full Fedora Core 4 version of Linux (normally taking 4 CDs), I thought I'd give this book a try.  I'm very satisfied with it. <br /> <br />This book is everything you need to get started with Linux.  It has the DVD (plus a 2 CD smaller equivalent) with the OS and a huge selection of applications/utilities, honest-to-goodness simple English explanations of how to get started with Linux, and similar explanations of how to do more advanced activities (networking and various server-type things).  The key is that the author translates that previously mentioned arcana in reasonable steps that let the reader absorb the stuff without getting lost. <br /> <br />For those who are already past the initial \\"what's this Linux stuff anyway\\" stage, the book also seems to have all the information necessary to get various servers (Print Server, File Server, Mail Server, FTP Server, Web Server, LDAP Address Book Server, DHCP and NIS Server, MySQL Database Server, DNS Server, and Appletalk Server) up and running (that's beyond my needs and abilities, so I qualify that with \\"seems.\\").  If there's material that's missing from the book, it's not immediately apparent to me. <br /> <br />If you have any desire to try out Linux for the first time, or even if you're already experienced in Linux and want to learn advanced topics, I highly recommend this book.  I rate it at 4 stars out of 5.
If you're looking for a light book to read just to pass some time, this is a good candidate.  Nothing heavy here.  Outside of the utter improbability of the main premise, a completely spurious first chapter (with an introduced but unused character), and a miracle occuring to help resolve the plot, the book's decent.  I know that sounds a little odd, but it's true.  Plus, there's the added bonus of vocabulary improvement:  I've never seen so many multi-syllabic words in one book before.  I rate it at an adequate 3 stars out of 5.
I can't come up with anyone who should bother reading this book.  First, the authors don't really state who their audience is.  The closest they come is on the first page of the Preface where they say:    \\"...with the powerful and inexpensive computing tools currently available, we think that now is the right time to reconnect differential equations to its roots via an introductory course from a modeling perspective.  That is the goal of this text.\\"    Then, on page ix, they give a Chapter Dependency Chart which includes breakouts for Engineering students, Math/Physics students, Biology/Pre-Med students, and \\"A Course Emphasizing Systems.\\"  Regardless of the \\"Math/Physics\\" entry, above, the preponderance of evidence from the text itself leads to me believe that the intended audience is those who will apply differential equations (DEQs) in their jobs (i.e., non-Math-types) using computer models.  Of course, the fact that I have to synthesize (i.e., guess) the intended audience from various parts of the book instead of the authors just telling me is a strike against the book right there.    My guess as to the audience is supported, to some extent, by the way this book is written.  It seems to assume knowledge of various areas of physics, chemistry, engineering, and biology.  The point of the book doesn't seem to be to teach the understanding of the math underlying how to work with and solve DEQs.  Instead, it seems to be to teach some cookie-cutter steps to follow, perhaps using the \\"Lucky Guess Approach to Finding a Particular Solution\\"  (I'm not kidding), or if that fails, how to get the problem to a point where it can be entered into a \\"solver\\" and graphed.  I guess that's the \\"modeling perspective.\\"  The bigger problem is that the book doesn't even do a very good job of that.  First, the book seems to assume a pretty detailed knowledge of DEQs themselves.  Second, the authors skip huge swaths of how they solve their examples (I won't even talk about missing stepsin the few \\"proofs\\" they give).  One particular case keeps popping into my mind.  The authors spend a couple of lines translating the verbal problem into the DEQ, wave their hands and says \\"after some algebra,\\" and present a very-non-obvious solution equation which stretches across the entire page.  My guess is that the \\"some algebra\\" they skipped would take several pages of calculus and algebraic manipulation.  If non-math-types are the audience, I don't see how skipping ALL the math in examples will help them get to the answers.  And, finally, the authors also skip steps in telling the reader how to translate situations into the DEQs themselves.  For instance, when they introduce the Predator-Prey model, they give verbal descriptions of the \\"Laws\\" involved and present the reader with the DEQs.  After the fact, they generically talk about why the equations look this way, but they don't try to walk the readers through the process they used to come up with the DEQs.    So, in a nutshell, math-types should stay away from this book since it doesn't really seem to be a math book, and non-math-types should stay away from it because it skips too many steps and assumes too much.  I really can't even see the point of this book.  Perhaps if it were used as a companion to a manual in some kind of course in DEQ modeling (solver) SOFTWARE.  But, as is, I rate this book as just 1 star out of 5:  useless.
While in college almost 25 years ago, I vowed never again to read a book that talks about pulling balls from urns:  i.e., no more probability books.  But, since this book is used in a required course for a degree program I was reading through (Florida State University's (FSU's) STA 4442: \\"Introductory Probability I\\" course, required for their Computer Science degree), I decided to try the subject again. I should have listened to myself and stayed away.  I managed to get through the first four chapters before having to put the book away.  There are just too many assumptions of knowledge and leaps of logic over vast quantities of missing steps for me to work my way through the book on my own.  This is especially bad, since the Preface states:<br /><br />\\"This book is intended as an elementary introduction to the theory of probability for students in mathematics, statistics, engineering, and the sciences (including computer science, the social sciences and management science) who posses the prerequisite knowledge of elementary calculus.\\"<br /><br />The first use of that word, \\"elementary,\\" above, definitely doesn't belong there.  Also, I shudder to think of the reaction of people in the social and management sciences who end up in a course using this book.  On a more constructive note, I'd add to the prerequisites a *heavy* grounding in discrete math.<br /><br />To add a bit more information to the raw data of these reviews, I've mapped the universe of all possible readers of this book onto a set of x-y axes. Let the x-axis run from \\"non-Math-types\\" up through \\"Math-types.\\" Let they y-axis go from \\"non-geniuses\\" up through \\"geniuses:\\"<br /><br />- Quadrant I: genius Math-types.  This group, along with the Quadrant IIs, has a chance at getting something useful out of the book.  It's fairly evenly divided between theory and application, but I'd say the emphasis appears to lean slightly towards using probability theory over proving it (only slightly, mind you).  Everything, however, starts out with the theory and with proofs.  The problem is that the proofs are missing the majority of their steps and require quite a bit of mathematical knowledge and bashing one's head onto the table to get through.  Quadrant Is will probably have the least trouble with this.<br /><br />- Quadrant II: genius non-Math-types. Like the Quadrant Is, above, these people have a chance at getting something useful out of the book.  Though there is quite a bit of theory present, it's also coupled with quite a lot of applications via the examples (several for each theoretical blurb).  Since there are so many steps missing from both the proofs and the examples, those on the \\"genius\\" side of the coordinate system are the ones most likely to have a chance at forcing themselves through the material to actual understanding.<br /><br />- Quadrant III: non-genius non-Math-types (i.e., \\"normal\\" people). This group is going to have a lot of trouble with this book.  With a good professor or knowledgeable person nearby, they might be able to work through the assumptions and gaps in the material (with a lot of effort).  But, in general, this book is really not for them.  The large number of examples will help, but won't be sufficient.<br /><br />- Quadrant IV: non-genius Math-types. This group falls into the same boat as the Quadrant IIIs:  the book's not for them.  Though their math predilection might give them a moderate advantage in working out what the author is trying to do, they're still going to have trouble working through the proofs with all their missing steps.<br /><br />This book is really only suitable for either genius Math-, or genius non-Math-types.  I'd recommend that anyone who doesn't read through mathematics like fish swim through the sea avoid it.  With a professor handy to fill in the gaps the author leaves, the book might be acceptable to us mortals.  But, for those on their own, there's no way they'll get through.  Because of the mismatch between the audience the Preface lays out and the way the text is written, I rate this book at 3 stars out of 5., I rate this book at 3 stars out of 5.
This is the 29th in Pratchett's Discworld series.  It's also one of the standalone books (\\"Equal Rites,\\" \\"Pyramids,\\" \\"Moving Pictures,\\" \\"Small Gods,\\" \\"The Truth,\\" \\"Monstrous Regiment,\\" and \\"Going Postal\\").  As others have noted here, there's a definite trend in Pratchett's work away from the hilariously funny.  This is not necessarily a bad thing:  it's just different.  This work, like his other recent stuff, is humorous in a way, but is nowhere near as funny as what went on at the start of the series.  Mostly, the humor now lies in the mere existence of the parody of the real world and in the hyperbole he uses to establish that parody.  The plot and theme are actually quite dark (in this case, the villification of eeeeeevil big business, the glorification of old-time hackers, and, oddly, for Ankh-Morpork, the promotion of a government monopoly).      On it's own, this is a very good book.  However, those who've gone through all of his earlier works might still be expecting the younger, funnier Pratchett.  I think after all this time, we can wave that person goodbye.  What you see in this book is probably the kind of material we'll be getting for a good, long time.  I rate it at 4 stars out of 5.
This book tries to be too many things to too many people.  According to page xxiv of the Preface: <br /> <br />\\"In addition to an introductory database course, the book contains enough advanced material so that it can be used for the following courses: <br /> <br /> - An undergraduate or graduate course in transaction processing for students who have had an introductory course in databases <br /> - An advanced undergraduate or a first graduate course in databases for students who have had an introductory course in databases <br /> - A course in electronic commerce and Web sevices.\\" <br /> <br />The first half of this book is made up of the material from its \\"Introductory Version\\" brother (ASIN:0321228383).  The last half is the additional material to be used for the other courses listed above. <br /> <br />The problem is that the book reads more like a brain dump of everything the authors know about databases instead of like a textbook tying to teach some reasonable subsection to us ignorant masses.  More specifically, each section (and sometimes each chapter) should probably be an entire textbook in itself.  As an example, Chapter 15 talks about XML and Web Data.  It starts by talking about how data on web pages is semi-structured and how this can lead to problems getting that kind of data into a database.  It then introduces XML to the reader as a possible way to overcome this difficulty.  Then, the authors basically dump the entirety of the XML language's syntax and semantics on you (XML Elements and Database Objects, XML Attributes, Namespaces, Document Type Definitions, Inadequacy of DTDs as a Data Definition Language).  Since that section ends with the inadequacies of XML, the authors then go on to do the same thing with a revision of XML (XML Schema:  XML Schema and Namespaces, Simple Types, Complex Types, Putting It Together, Shortcuts:  Anonymous Types and Element References, Integrity Constraints).  Now that they've told us everything that we'd ever want to know about the data handling capabilities of XML and it's revisions, they go on to describe (in detail) the syntax and sematics of four different XML Query Languages (XPath:  A Lightweight XML Query Language, XSLT:  A Transformation Language for XML, XQuery:  A Full-Featured Query Language for XML, SQL/XML).  Mind you, this is ONE CHAPTER (almost 100 pages long).  Most authors would have treated this as a textbook (and course) in its own right.  But, this is just one of 26 similarly-written chapters in this book. <br /> <br />Also in the preface, the authors state that \\"rather than focusing on how to build a database management system (DBMS), our approach focuses on how to build applications that use such a system.  We believe that many more students will be implementing database applications than building DMBSs.\\"  That might be true.  But, since I started with only a light dusting of knowledge of the workings of DBMSs, and the first half of this book is supposed to be an \\"introductory database course, finding out how to build a DBMS would probably have taught me more about how they work than what the authors present. <br /> <br />At a more pedantic level, my next biggest gripe is with the amount, type, and degree of contextual references in the book.  There are tons of backward references to absolutely vital, detailed tables in the book.  Unless you have a phenomonal memory, there's no way you can get by without constantly paging back (in some cases, hundreds of pages) to see what the authors are talking about.  In the authors' defense, I can see why they did this:  the book is already almost 1,200 pages long.  If they had copied those tables to every place they reference them, this unwieldy tome would have been even larger.  But, worse than the backward references are the FORWARD references.  They're not as prevalent as the backward ones, but I can't come up with any real justification for them.  In many cases, the authors reference material that's several pagesahead of where they are.  It's not like the paragraph ends way up there and that's the first chance they get to include the material.  In several cases, they included the reference way past the end of the SECTION (not just paragraph) where they were talking about it.  Very irritating. <br /> <br />As an aside, Florida State University (FSU) uses this book in its COP 4710 course: \\"Theory and Structure of Databases.\\"  With a professor available to TEACH the material in the book, this book is probably acceptable.  But for the individual reader (like me), it's not very useful.  I rate this book as 2 stars out of 5.
From the 2nd paragraph of the preface, the authors:<br /><br />\\"...wrote this book as a text for an introductory course in operating systems at the junior or senior undergraduate level or at the first-year graduate level....  It provides a clear description of the concepts that underlie operating systems.  As prerequisites, we assume that the reader is familiar with basic data structures, computer organization, and a high-level language, such as C.\\"<br /><br />I'd say that's an excellent synopsis of this book.  It's not a book on how to use or how to program operating systems.  It's a book on the CONCEPTS underlying them.  It's not as difficult to get through, but it's somewhat like Patterson's & Hennessy's \\"Computer Organization and Design: The Hardware/Software Interface\\" &lt;ASIN:1558606041>.  Where that book looks at how computers work from the point of view of electrons whizzing by on the silicon, this book looks at how they work from the point of view of the operating system.  Personally, I'd put the target educational level at no lower than the senior undergraduate level just because it'd probably be very difficult for a junior to have the necessary prerequisites.  But, regardless, it's a well-written book that covers the topic decently.  I rate it at 4 stars out of 5.<br /><br />As an aside, Florida State University (FSU) uses this book in their COP 4610 course: \\"Operating Systems & Concurrent Programming.\\"
This is NOT a book on Unified Modeling Language (UML).  It's not a book on Object Constraint Language (OCL).  It's also not a book on Capability Maturity Models (CMM), Class-Responsibilities-Collaborators (CRC) cards, Decision Representation Language (DRL), Extreme Programming (XP), Gantt charts, Issue-Based Information Systems (IBIS), Joint Appication Design (JAD), Key Process Areas (KPA), the Liskov Substitution Principle, Model-View-Controller (MVC) architectural styles, Nonfunctional Requirements (NFR) Frameworks, Object Design Documents (ODD), PERT charts, the Questions-Options-Criteria (QOC) model, Requirements Analysis Documents (RAD), Royce's methodology, Software Configuration Management Plans (SCMP), System Design Documents (SDD), Software Project Management Plans (SPMP), the Unified Software Development Process, User Manuals, V-Models, Work Breakdown Structures (WBS), or any of the myriad other tools introduced in the book.    This IS a book to introduce newly-minted programmers to the kind of things, tools, and processes they can look forward to (with either anticipation or dread) in the real world of software development.  As the authors state on page viii of the Preface:    \\"We have observed that students are taught programming and software engineering techniques in isolation, often using small problems as examples.  As a result, they are able to solve well-defined problems efficiently, but are overwhelmed by the complexity of their first real development experience, when many different techniques and tools need to be used and different people need to collaborate.\\"    It's been many years since I was involved in major software development projects (and those were all in the military).  But, this book seems to have covered everything that all new programmers need to know so that they aren't simply lost when they enter their first software project.  The readers certainly won't be experts in the things covered, but they'll at least have a good grounding and be able to bootstrap themselves from there (especially since the authors provide \\"Further Readings\\" and a Bibliography at the end of each chapter).  For instance, on page 71, under Further Readings, they list three works on UML:  one of which is the 566 page official specification, \\"OMG Unified Modeling Language Specification.\\"    Overall, this is an excellent book for anyone who is just entering the software development world.  I rate it at 5 stars out of 5.    As a side note, Florida State University (FSU) uses this book in its COP 3331: \\"Object-Oriented Analysis and Design\\" course.
For a discrete math book, this one is pretty good (it's far better than the last one I read).  From the Preface on, the author states exactly what he's going to do (and why), does it, and then summarizes it.  This gives the book good structure and is an excellent teaching methodology.  There are oodles of examples and tons of exercises (odd numbers answered).  Each section has its own exercises as do the chapters themselves.  There are also more challenging \\"Supplementary Exercises\\" following the chapter exercises.  Right up front, the author states that \\"the book has been designed for students in computer science, electrical engineering, and mathematics as a one- or two-semester course in discrete mathematics at the sophomore/junior level.\\"  He got that exactly right.  To emphasize the applications orientation, he also provides \\"Computer Assignments\\" at the end of each chapter (and computer algorithmic examples within each chapter).  In what I consider to be an odd twist, he also includes a set of writing projects at the end of each chapter.    Unfortunately, there's one big negative to the book:  it contains a lot of errors.  These range from inconsequential typos through errors in mathematical definitions and proofs to wrong answers for exercises.  For instance, the first serious contextual error I found is on page 78:  the definitions of set union and intersection are wrong.  Both read \\"...x such that x is an element of A OR x is an element of B.\\"  Obviously, the intersection is supposed to be AND, but they both read OR.  Usually, these types of errors are easy to spot from the surrounding, correct, material.  For errors in exercises, the first several I found are:  Exercises 1.2, #63; Exercises 1.4, #21; Exercises 1.5, #37; Exercises 2.2, #15; Exercises 2.4, #33, #45, #47; Chapter 3 Review Exercises, #33, #37; and Chapter 5 Review Exercises, #5 (after this, I stopped keeping track).    To add a bit more information to the raw data of these reviews, I've mappedthe universe of all possible readers of this book onto a set of x-y axes. Let the x-axis run from \\"non-Math-types\\" up through \\"Math-types.\\" Let they y-axis go from \\"non-geniuses\\" up through \\"geniuses:\\"    - Quadrant I: genius Math-types.  This group will probably not appreciate the book.  It's definitely aimed at the application of discrete math instead of at the proving of it.  There are many proofs in the book, but there are also a lot missing.  There doesn't seem to be any pattern to this.  At a guess, I'd say that if a proof isn't easy, the author just leaves it out.  Regarding the intellectual level of the text, Quadrant Is might be OK with it.  Some of the material is fairly easy, but other parts are pretty challenging:  it's a good mix.  Overall, this group could probably get by with the book, they would just complain a lot :) .    - Quadrant II: genius non-Math-types.  The intellectual level of the book follows the same pattern for this group as for the Quadrant Is, above.  The application focus would please the Quadrant IIs more, though.  Like the Quadrant Is, the Quadrant IIs would probably find the book acceptable (probably a little more so than the Quadrant Is).    - Quadrant III: non-genius non-Math-types (i.e., \\"normal\\" people).  This is the group that should get the most out of the book.  The book is well-structured and complete and leads the reader through a reasonable sequence from basics to advanced topics.  For the most part, the author is careful to keep the intellectual and theoretical levels reasonable (though I'm still lost regarding Relations, Graphs, Digraphs, and Formal Languages and Finite-State Machines -- and his recurring motif of Fibonacci-related stuff is tough).  Assuming most people will use the book in a classroom setting, the errors in it shouldn't be a problem since the instructor should be able to point them out.    - Quadrant IV: non-genius Math-types.  This group can be lumped in with the Quadrant Is:  the intellectual level of the book isn't the problem -- it's the application orientation that would bother them.  Quadrant IVs could get by with the book, but would complain a bit.    Regardless of its errors, this is a pretty good book.  The potential audience covers the entire universe of readers with the best target being Quadrant III (\\"normal\\" people).  It's written well enough to be good for university use as well as for personal reading (mostly).  Without the number of errors, I would have given this a rating of 4 stars out of 5.  Because of them, I'm reducing my rating to 3 stars out of 5.
Because of physical problems with this book, the authors' programming style, and lack of a proper audience, I just can't recommend it.  There are just too many problems and too few positives for the book to be worthwhile.    First, the physical problems with the book:  in my case, the binding appears to be bad.  As I took it out of its plastic wrapping, I noticed a gap between the cover spine and the glued/sewn binding of the actual pages.  It looks like the glue that was supposed to hold the two parts of the book together failed.  Turning the pages causes a lot of snapping, crackling, and popping and I worry that the binding will break.  Second, it seems like the book uses too small a font (these old eyes don't focus like they used to).  Oddly, if I compare the font size to that in other textbooks, it looks comparable.  I'm not sure, but I think the publisher used a slightly smaller line spacing and either a lighter ink or darker paper.  Whatever it is, it makes reading the book a bit hard.  That's pretty subjective and minor, but more aggravating is that the publisher used an even lighter (gray) font for the code segments.  This makes the code even harder to read than the text.  Again, I'm not certain, but it also looks like the font in the code sections is even smaller than the font in the text.  And finally, the authors don't use any color in their code.  It's hard to distinguish the actual code from the comments.  This makes reading the code difficult.    Next, I highly disagree with the authors' coding style.  Essentially, I consider it sloppy.  In general, they don't write their class methods to ensure data integrity (and that's one of the big advantages of classes (which are at the core of this book)).  Also, the authors tend to directly access private class members within the class methods instead of using the class' already defined public methods that do the same thing (get/set).  I know this is allowed, but it's still bad software engineering:  you shouldre-use code wherever possible.  Similarly, and  worse, the authors violate the principles of data hiding by writing classes with public data members instead of with private data members and public get/set methods.  I also have a problem with the authors using \\"using namespace std;\\" in their code.  Since this exposes all of the C++ standard library methods to the program, it can lead to conflicts.  I understand that in a teaching environment this might be good for keeping the focus on the topic at hand instead of \\"cluttering up the code\\" with nuances, but the authors make no reference to this rationale.  They just blindly use that line in all their code.  I'd much prefer they explicitly did a \\"using std::whatever;\\" when they needed it.  What's especially bad is that they do this in all the HEADERS they provide for their examples (not just in the \\"main\\" programs).  Anyone who uses any of those headers automatically ends up with all the namespace names included in their code.  And, finally, not only are the authors lax in their object oriented programming, they're also lax in their structured programming:  they routinely, and without comment, use break statements to jump out of the infinite for-loops (which are feats in themselves) they set up to handle their file input.    Finally, and most importantly, the authors don't seem to have a grasp on who their audience is.  In the Preface and the start of the first chapter, they specifically state that the readers should already be familiar with objects and classes from a first course in C++.  They note that they aren't about to review old topics, but, instead, will pick up where that left off.  However, most of the book is a re-hashing of basic C++ programming.  For instance:    - Chapter 1 is a review of programming classes (and, thus, objects) in C++.    - Chapter 2 discusses 1) software design, 2) handling runtime errors, 3) object composition, and 4) operator overloading.    - Chapter 3 covers templates and recursion.The algorithms discussed are those usually presented in C++ programming courses:  selection sort, sequential search, binary search, tower of hanoi, and greatest common divisor.    - Chapter 5 goes over pointers, pointer arithmetic, dynamic memory allocation, constructors and destructors.    - Chapter 7, stacks.  Chapter 8, queues.  Chapter 9, linked lists.  Chapter 10, binary trees.  Chapter 13, inheritance and abstract classes.    All of this is what I consider to be basic C++ (see Deitel's \\"C++ How to Program\\" book to find references to all those things).  I just can't see how anyone could learn even the rudiments of C++ without having covered those topics.  I could be wrong (in which case, since I've provided my rationale for my rating, you'll at least know what to ignore in this review).  But, for all intents and purposes, the authors don't really start teaching anything new until after page 500 (Chapter 10) in a 1000 page (16 chapter) book.  And even there, I was so irritated with the various problems I noted above, that I kept wondering how much credence to put in the authors' presentation.    So, in a nutshell, because of the physical problems with the book itself, the sloppiness of the authors' programming style, and their mis-identification of the audience, I can't recommend this book.  I rate it at only 2 stars out of 5.    As a side note, at the time I bought this book, Florida State University (FSU) used it in their COP 4530: \\"Data Structures, Algorithms & Generic Programming\\" course.  They've now switched to  a book called \\"Data Structures & Algorithms in C++,\\" 3e, by Drozdek.  I don't know anything about that book, but based solely on this book, FSU did the right thing.
This book wasn't what I expected it to be.  I was expecting something from the point of view of being an Administrator and being shown what I needed to do, why I needed to do it, and how I would use Microsoft Windows Server 2003 to do it.  Instead, this book is written from the point of view of being an Administrator and being shown what Microsoft Windows Server 2003 can do and exactly how to do it.  For the most part, the book is descriptive instead of prescriptive.  Given that, the book does a very good job.  It's extremely detailed and covers a huge spectrum of what Microsoft Windows Server 2003 can do.  One odd thing is that even though the author assumes in-depth knowledge of the terminology and concepts of server administration, he also seems to assume that the reader has never seen a Microsoft Windows XP desktop.  He spends a good chunk of the book describing (in detail) things that anyone who has ever worked with XP already knows.    So, ignoring the fact that this book wasn't what I expected, overall, if you know what you're doing as an Administrator and just need to know how Microsoft Windows Server 2003 does the things you need to do, then I highly recommend this book.  I give it a rating of four stars out of five.    As a side note, this book is used in Florida State University's (FSU's) CIS 4407: \\"Computer and Network System Administration\\" course.
This book is probably 75% identical to the Deitels' \\"C How to Program\\" book (4th edition, like this book).  So, for a little more information, you might take a look at my review of that book here on Amazon.  The biggest differences between the books are: <br /> <br />- Even though most of the examples are the same, their implementations have been redone from a C perspective to a C++ perspective.  This is not a C book with C++ tacked on.  It's a C++ book that leverages examples from a C book.  If you hadn't read the other book, you'd never know the examples didn't originate for use in this book. <br />- This book includes an Elevator Simulation case study using the Unified Modeling Language (UML) to emphasize the object orientedness of C++ and to show the reader how to implement a fairly good-sized project in C++. <br />- Although the C version of the book also includes a C++ segment, this book gives a far more in-depth coverage and includes some things that aren't included there (the Standard Template Library comes to mind). <br /> <br />So, which book to choose?  If you're using these books for a class, there's no choice:  get the one the class requires.  If you're trying to learn C++ on your own from scratch, this book is the best choice.  If you don't know whether you should learn C or C++, this is also the book to get:  it's probably heresy to say, but if you know C++, you essentially know C.  If you're a pure C type, you might pick up the C version as an excellent reference and read the segments on C++ and Java included in that book.  Those segments are condensed enough that you shouldn't be bored going through them.  As with the C book, in the preface of this book, the Deitels state that the book is for everyone (beginners to experts) who want to learn the language. They've made a very good stab at that goal, but realistically, I'd have to say that those who are professional programmers in other languages will find this book too long for their needs. <br /> <br />A couple of additional notes.  First, the use of color in this book seems to be a recurring motif in the reviews here.  I was very pleased with the book's use of color.  As fully explained in the preface, all that color conveys information to the reader:  it's not there for decoration.  First, the code examples (and there are a lot of them) all have a light yellow background, so they are automatically offset from the rest of the text.  Then, the type within the coding segments uses other colors to mean certain things:  comments are in green, keywords are in dark blue, errors are in red, constants and literal values are in light blue, and all other code is in black.  Newly introduced code is also highlighted for emphasis.  This is very much in keeping with what various IDEs do to make code more readable (see any of Microsoft's Visual xxx products, the Eclipse Project Universal Tool Platform (specifically, the C/C++ Development Tools), and the Bloodshed Dev-C++ IDE).  Beyond that, the book also uses colors to emphasize the titles of the programming tips in the text (i.e., Good Programming Practices, Common Programming Errors, Performance Tips, Portability Tips, Software Engineering Observations, and Testing and Debugging Tips).  Again, all of this is an excellent way to convey more information to the reader and is not \\"distracting\\" in any way. <br /> <br />On an entirely different note, as an aside, this book is used in Florida State University's COP 3330: \\"Object-Oriented Programming\\" course. <br /> <br />Overall, this is a very good book. Experienced programmers might prefer something more terse, but all others will be pleased. I give it 4 stars out of 5.
This is a tough book to review.  On one hand, it's got an amazing amount of information in it.  On the other, it's got a lot of editing problems.  It also suffers from a lack of focus on who its audience is.  So, splitting the difference, I'm rating this book at 4 stars out of 5.    Regarding the book's audience, it's vital that you pay attention to the chart on page xiii of the Preface.  It maps your path through the book based on whether you're a software-type or a hardware-type.  Assuming I was so brilliant that I could ignore such trivia, I attempted to plow my way through the whole book.  Software-type that I am, I had some tough times in a couple of sections and then utterly failed to understand anything when I hit the core of Chapter 5.  If I had paid attention to that chart, I would have known to skip that part of the book.  However, even for the material that's within the path laid out for you by that chart, a lot of the work seems to assume knowledge on the part of the reader.  For instance:    - Chapter 2 is about the MIPS assembly language.  In the exercises, you're supposed to write various code snippets.  Many of these snippets assume far more familiarity with writing entire assembly programs than is presented.  - The exercises at the end of each chapter are broken into three types:  regular, \\"For More Practice,\\" and \\"In More Depth.\\"  Those last two types require far more knowledge than is presented.  It looks like the authors culled them from previous editions and, instead of trashing them, just stuck them on the CD and referenced them.  - Exercise 3.9 is annotated as requiring Section 3.2.  But, unless you're very familiar with the implementation of MIPS assembly language, there's no way that someone using the material in that section alone could do the problem.  - Exercise 3.13 is annotated as requiring Section 3.3.  Yet, the question is completely undoable unless you've at least read Appendix B. Of course, Appendix B, itself, is practically indecipherable unless you've had previous experience/knowledge with Logic Design.  - Exercises 7.21, 7.22 and 7.38 talk about \\"the first 1 million references in a trace of gcc.\\"  The book contains no definition of what that means.  Those questions also mention the cache simulator \\"dinero\\" and say, \\"see the Preface of this book for information on how to obtain them.\\" There's no such information in the Preface or on the CD.  The CD does have MipsIt software which includes a cache simulator, but it doesn't seem to work reliably on my XP SP2 system (it also doesn't seem to accept those \\"traces\\" as input).  That could be operator error, though.  Doing a Google search pointed me to max.stanford.edu as a source of the software and traces.  But, it seems you have to have a Linux system (or be smarter than me) to use them.  - Exercise 7.35 gives a C code snippet and asks you to calculate the expected cache miss rate.  There's nothing in the book about calculating expected miss rates from algorithms.  Also, the exercise is assigned partially against section 7.4.  Section 7.4 covers virtual memory, not caches.  - Most of the Chapter 8 exercises are mis-referenced (i.e., they're labeled as being associated with certain sections of the chapter which have nothing to do with the question).  Along with the standard problem of assuming knowledge that's not covered in the book, many of them teach new information instead of testing/re-enforcing comprehension of the provided material.    There are many incorrect page number and section number references in the book.  This is especially bad in the exercises where it becomes impossible to do certain ones since the code and data they're referencing isn't findable (at least easily).  This problem does seem to get better as you get to the later chapters.  There are also problems with basic typography.  Some examples:    - Exercise 3.29 wants the reader to come up with a non-restoring division algorithm based on the restoring division algorithm inFigure 3.11 on page 185.  The figure and page numbers are right, but the text of the question refers to \\"step 3b\\" and \\"restoring the Remainder\\" that aren't present there.  So, there's no way to figure out what the authors are doing or what they want the reader to do in the exercise.  - Many of the tables and diagrams in the book use \\"color\\" to help indicate something important.  Unfortunately, the color used is dark blue.  Unless you look very carefully, there's no difference between the regular text/line color (black) and the \\"emphasized\\" version.  - The text description of Figure 7.31 on page 544 mentions labeled sections that show differences in performance based on cache associativity.  The labels are missing.  - Exercise 7.45 gives you a C snippet that you're supposed to document.  It contains \\"!!\\" as an operator.  C has no such operator.  My guess is it's either a logical AND, \\"&&\\", or a logical OR, \\"||\\".    Also, the chapters are WAY too long and there are no exercises following the sections.  For instance, Chapter 2 is 100 pages long over 20 sections.  All the exercises (59 of them) are clumped together in the back of the chapter.  The authors note the necessary section numbers with these exercises, but each section needs its own set of exercises immediately following it.  This would also alleviate the problem where the authors have the wrong section numbers assigned to exercises.  If these exercises were at the end of a section instead of clumped with 60 other exercises at the back of the chapter, they'd stand out more if they didn't belong.    And, finally, the book needs answers to the questions.    As an aside, this book is used in Florida State University's (FSU) CDA 3101:  Computer Organization course.
My review for Pratchett's \\"A Hat Full of Sky\\" reads almost exactly like that for Pratchett's \\"Wee Free Men\\" (the prequel to this book).  First, and most importantly, I don't care what the \\"official\\" write-ups for this book say: this is not just a book for pre-pubescent youth. Outside of the fact that the protagonist is an 11-year old and some of the behavior/situations are somewhat simplified (i.e., it doesn't have the layers and layers of meaning buried in Pratchett's other works), this is standard Discworld fare. Some mild complaints are that the book appears to finish up just after the middle.  However, that was a faulty assumption on my part and I quickly saw what Pratchett intended.  Also, Granny Weatherwax isn't quite in character:  she's too warm.  I've marked the book down from five stars to four because of the mild simplification, but other than that, it's pretty darn good.
There are six books in Peter F. Hamilton's \\"Night's Dawn\\" series: <br /> <br />- \\"The Reality Dysfunction - Part 1: Emergence,\\" <br />- \\"The Reality Dysfunction - Part 2: Expansion,\\" <br />- \\"The Neutronium Alchemist - Part 1: Consolidation,\\" <br />- \\"The Neutronium Alchemist - Part 2: Conflict,\\" <br />- \\"The Naked God - Part 1: Flight,\\" and <br />- \\"The Naked God - Part 2: Faith.\\" <br /> <br />Be warned: you CANNOT read these books individually. They are, essentially, chapters in one whopping great book. If you like the first book, then you'll have to read the other five books in order. There's no tie-up of any sort between any of the books. The publisher just broke the story up because it totals over 3,000 pages. If you pick up a book before you've read all the previous books (in order), put it down. It won't mean anything to you. Since these books are entirely dependent on each other, I'm writing this review on the series as a whole, not on the individual books. <br /> <br />This is one of the greatest science fiction sagas written. It ranks up there with David Brin's \\"Uplift Saga.\\" It is literally a story of good vs evil and shows some of the potential (and pitfalls) of the human race. Over the years, I've read the whole series five times, and I still love it. I really only have two gripes with the book. First, and this is unavoidable in what Hamilton is doing, the evil in the series is definitely, graphically evil. This is not a book where the villain twists his mustache and laughs \\"nyah hah hah\\" as he forecloses on the orphanage or ties the heroine to the railroad tracks. The writing is fairly graphic in a lot of places. After five readings, this gets a bit wearing. My second gripe is one which somewhat limits the audience of the series (even more so than the evilness presented, and it's why I've given the series four stars instead of five): there's too much sex and the writing about it is too graphic. This is a problem with all of Hamilton's books, but it seems more prevalent in this series. Because of this, I wouldn't recommend the book for your children to read. But, as long as you're aware of that, I highly recommend the series and give it 4 stars out of five.

Without doubt, this is the worst textbook I've ever had the misfortune to encounter. Even before the actual text starts, there's a discrepancy which bodes ill. Specifically, the back cover says:    \\"Written for SELF-STUDY and course use, this book will suit a variety of INTRODUCTORY and more advanced security programs for students of computer science, engineering and related disciplines.\\"    However, the Preface states:    \\"This book grew out of my lecture notes for courses taught on a one-year POSTGRADUATE programme on information security.\\"    The back cover is false and the Preface is much closer to what you can expect in the book:  no person at a Computer Science/Computer Security introductory level will be able to get anything out of this book. The reader MUST already be fully knowledgeable about Unix, NT, Multics, and various computer security models and jargon. There's no way around that. If you don't meet those requirements, don't even think about picking up this book.    The biggest problem with the book is that it's written from the viewpoint of someone talking to a group of people who are already familiar with the subject:  the author is merely pointing out things that those already-knowledgeable people should know. Instead of writing to teach people the topic, the author just synthesizes his own knowledge to focus on the subject. Also, he uses words not to explain and enlighten, but to confuse and obfuscate. For instance, his standard writing behavior is to use obscure technical terms well before he defines them. Plus, in general, as the book progresses, the exercises at the end of each chapter have less and less to do with anything discussed in the book and require such a level of expertise in huge swaths of areas that no one could possibly do them. Some specifics:    - The first five chapters are devoted to some of the theoretical underpinnings of the theory of computer security. Unfortunately, the author doesn't really explain these models. Instead, he assumes intimate knowledge of the models and talks about certain aspects of them. What's really jarring is that after solely talking about motherhood and apple pie (security wise) in nice, warm, fuzzy terms, he suddenly drops in \\"equations\\" from these models without explaining any of the terms or nomenclature (he follows this procedure throughout the book). Usually, after several pages you can find the definitions for what he's just said. But, unless you're familiar with what he's doing, none of this will make sense.    - For icing, in these first five chapters, the author uses virtually NO examples (which, for the most part, continues throughout the book). He'll mention Multics and some consultant data base as sources, but he never gives concrete examples of what he's \\"explaining.\\" Even worse, with no examples in the text, the author asks the reader to provide examples of what he's talking about in the exercises. In general, the exercises assume far more knowledge than the author has provided in the text.    - In chapter 6, \\"Unix Security,\\" he moves into \\"examples\\" of where these models are used. Similarly to earlier chapters, he writes as though his readers are intimately familiar with the subject (Unix, in this case) and that he's merely pointing out some interesting things. The chapter is filled with Unix commands with no structure to his delivery or explanation of where those commands come from. Plus, when you get to the exercises at the end of the chapter, they're mostly of the type that require you to SIGN ON TO YOUR UNIX SYSTEM AND DO THINGS! There's nothing in the preface of this book stating the requirement for being on (and intimately familiar with) a Unix system. Yet, there you are, unable to understand the chapter, and unable to do the exercises.    - Chapter 7, \\"Windows NT Security,\\" is almost as bad. For someone with no familiarity with the inner workings of NT, most of the chapter will be meaningless. It's not quite as bad as Chapter 6 since NT uses a GUI for what he discusses and Unix uses the command line, but it's still frustrating. Unlike Chapter 6 and Unix, the exercises don't assume access to an NT machine, although most of them can't be done with only the information presented in the chapter.    - Chapter 8, \\"How Things Go Wrong,\\" is actually somewhat interesting. It suffers from the same assumption that the reader is intimately familiar with the technical jargon of various systems and protocols. But, it actually involves examples. Of course, the exercises at the end of the chapter are undoable since they don't relate to anything taught in the chapter and are at a highly technically adept level.    I'm running out of space, so I won't write about the remaining seven chapters except to say that they suffer from the same things related above. I'd also like to include some advice to Florida State University (FSU): this book is the text for an elective (CIS 4360: \\"Introduction to Computer Security\\") in their Computer Science degree. According to the course write-up, its sole prerequisite is CGS 3408, which is a C programming course. FSU seriously needs to re-examine their use of this book. There's no chance that undergraduate students with only a C programming course under their belts (and C is used nowhere in the book) will get anything out of this book other than hemorrhoids. Find another book.    I rate this book 1 star out of 5. Avoid.

Before you use this book, make sure you understand the author's purpose:  \\"Although the book is elementary in the level of mathematics required and in the statistical procedures presented, it aims to give students both an understanding of the main ideas of statistics and useful skills for working with data\\" (Preface, pp xiv-xv).  The key point here is \\"elementary in the level of mathematics required.\\"  Essentially, this is a math-lite version of statistics.  With that in mind, the author did a decent job of passing on a working knowledge of statistics (I'll bet all the math in the book could fit on one 5x8 card).  Also, the book has TONS of examples.  I'd say that at least half of the text is just the author working through real-world examples.  So, if you have trouble understanding the statistical concepts the author is trying to get across, there's sure to be plenty of examples immediately following his explanation to help you work things out. <br /> <br />To add a bit more information to the raw data of these reviews, I've mapped the universe of all possible readers of this book onto a set of x-y axes. Let the x-axis run from \\"non-Math-types\\" up through \\"Math-types.\\" Let they y-axis go from \\"non-geniuses\\" up through \\"geniuses:\\" <br /> <br />- Quadrant I: genius Math-types might as well not even pick this book up.  There's almost no math here, nothing is proven, and the example-to-meat ratio is darn near infinite. <br /> <br />- Quadrant II: genius non-Math-types, like the Quadrant Is, should also skip this book.  The application focus will please them, but that example-to-meat ratio I mentioned above will bore them to tears. <br /> <br />- Quadrant III: non-genius non-Math-types (i.e., \\"normal\\" people).  Normally, I consider this one group.  However, this book is probably at too simple a level for most of them.  The book essentially starts from the assumption that the reader has never used Excel or a calculator to put numbers into a table and graph them.  In thisday and age, most people will probably be familiar with this.  However, for those who aren't, or for those looking for an easy primer in statistics, this is the book for you.  Starting, essentially, from scratch, the author will move you up to an ability to understand and use statistics better than most people on the planet (nothing esoteric, just the core stuff).  About the only math you need is basic Algebra. <br /> <br />- Quadrant IV: non-genius Math-types, like the Quadrant Is and Quadrant IIs, should probably avoid this book.  There's just not enough math in it to satisfy their learning desires.  Plus, since they're Math-types, they will probably already know enough math to make what's in this book redundant. <br /> <br />Overall, this is a decent book (I rate it 4 stars out of 5). The author did a good job matching his material to his chosen audience (a subset of Quadrant IIIs). For anyone on the \\"genius\\" or \\"Math\\" side of my coordinate system, I highly recommend they AVOID this book.  For the majority of the Quadrant III (\\"normal\\") people, the lack of almost any math might make the book too simplistic.  But, for those with few math skills and little background in number manipulation or graphing, this is a very good start.
This book is used in FSU's CGS 3408 course: \\"Introduction to Programming with the C Language.\\"  In the preface, the Deitels state that this book is for everyone (beginners to experts) who want to learn C.  They've made a very good stab at that goal, but realistically, I'd have to say that those who are professional programmers in other languages will find this book too long for their needs.  For beginners (and even those moderately versed in other languages), this is an excellent book.  I really have only three minor gripes about it:      - First, throughout the C portion, the book uses scanf as the default for getting user input.  Unfortunately, as my compiler warned me constantly (and I verified on the web), scanf has been \\"deprecated\\" (I guess that's a fancy way to say don't use it, use something else).  Unfortunately, the book talks about alternative IO in only one chapter near the end of the C portion and very rarely uses it.  So, this book teaches as a standard an input method that's been superseded.      - Second, and related to the first, the book clumps all IO except for printf and scanf into a single chapter near the end.  It would have been a lot better if they had introduced alternative IO a little at a time throughout the book.  As it is, my eyes just glazed over when I hit that chapter.      - And, finally, though this might sound weird, there are too many exercises at the end of each chapter.  I read through this book on my own and so had no way of choosing which exercises to do.  Some of the chapters have over 40 programming exercises.  I suppose this is great at a college where the instructors can select different exercises for years without repeating.  But, as an individual, I'd have preferred a handful of in-depth exercises focusing on the chapter material instead of a huge number of varied exercises (some of which don't seem to have much bearing on the chapter).    One note about the content of this book:  most of it (over half) is dedicated to C.  It covers C in detail.  The remaining half is equally divided between C++ and Java.  The level of detail in those chapters (and the exercises, too) comes nowhere near that in the C portion.  If you're interested in C++ or Java, those chunks in this book are good, but you'll really need to read dedicated books to get the full treatment.    Overall, a very good book.  Experienced programmers might prefer something more terse, but all others will be pleased.  I give it 4 stars out of 5.
To add a bit more information to the raw data of these reviews, I've mapped the universe of all possible readers of this book onto a set of x-y axes. Let the x-axis run from \\"non-Math-types\\" up through \\"Math-types.\\" Let they y-axis go from \\"non-geniuses\\" up through \\"geniuses:\\"    - Quadrant I: genius Math-types will probably be both irritated and bored with this book.  Their irritation will spring from the fact that not all of the pure-math proofs they'll be looking for are here.  The book focuses more on explaining and doing calculus than on proving it.  Most of the material is proven (properly:  no missing steps), but the proofs that would get in the way of doing calculus are omitted.  Quadrant Is will be bored because the author does his best to pound on a topic until practically everyone can understand it.  Genius math-types, since they're inherently capable of grasping this material from proofs alone, will not be pleased by this repetition.  For Quadrant Is, some version of Tom M. Apostol's Calculus books (ISBNs 9686708103, 842915003X, 8429150013, 0471000051, 0471503037, 0471000078, or 0471000086) would be a better text.    - Quadrant II: genius non-Math-types will probably prefer the fact that the author skipped some proofs in favor of applications.  However, like the Quadrant Is, they'll probably be somewhat bored by the author's \\"slowness\\" in moving on after he introduces a topic.  This book will be OK for them, but they'd probably prefer a more \\"terse\\" presentation.  Unfortunately, I don't have any recommendations for such a book.    - Quadrant III: non-genius non-Math-types (i.e., \\"normal\\" people), will find this book just right.  As noted above, the author's focus is on teaching and using calculus, not *necessarily* on proving it.  If the proofs are complex enough that they'd distract from that mission, they're either relegated to Appendix G or omitted (though most proofs are present).  Best of all, the author doesn't skip steps in his proofs:  all the steps are there in their detailed glory.  Later in the book, he will occasionally skip a simplification of an expression, but none of the \\"proof\\" material is missing.  In the latter half of the book, he sometimes does the \\"proof is left as an exercise for the student\\" routine, but those are for non-essential proofs.  After the author introduces a topic/theorem/method, he always gives multiple (at least three) examples.  So, if the readers are having trouble with the equations and proofs,  they'll have several chances to figure out what he means from the examples.  Also, all the odd problems have answers in the back of the book.  There are no steps included with the answers, but usually that's not a problem (since there are so many examples in the book).  I also found the appendices giving explanations of pre-Calculus math facts very useful:  it's been a long time since I've seen those things, so I needed the refresher.    - Quadrant IV: non-genius Math-types will join the Quadrant Is in disliking the skipping of several proofs, but, like the Quadrant IIIs, will be pleased with the thorough, step-by-step nature of the existing proofs.  Not the best choice of a textbook for them, but for those who are having trouble with a \\"pure math\\" Calculus book, this is a good supplement.    Overall, this is an excellent book (I rate it 5 stars out of 5).  The author did a wonderful job matching his material to his chosen audience (Quadrant III, \\"normal\\" people).  For non-genius non-math-types, I highly recommend it.  For genius non-math-types and non-genius math-types, it's OK.  Genius math-types should avoid it and try something like Apostol's Calculus.
Ouch.  I definitely made a mistake trying this book.  From what I can see, the only set of people who might find this book useful would be genius non-Math-types.  My handy-dandy way of explaining this is by mapping the universe of all possible readers onto a set of x-y axes.  Let the x axis run from \\"non-Math-types\\" up through \\"Math-types.\\"  Let they y axis go from \\"non-geniuses\\" up through \\"geniuses:\\"      - Quadrant I:  if you're a genius Math-type, you'll be aghast at the lack of rigor in the proofs and at all the steps missing from the few proofs given.  But, you might be able to work through the material on your own.  My guess, though, is that you'll throw the book across the room in disgust, instead.      - Quadrant II:  if you're a genius non-Math-type, you might find the lack of rigor in the proofs tolerable.  Plus, you, like the Quadrant Is, might be able to work through the material enough so that you can follow the author's explanations.  If you're smart enough and have enough familiarity with the material before reading this book, you might find its terseness acceptable.      - Quadrant III:  if you're a non-genius non-Math-type (i.e., \\"normal\\"), you'll be lost.  You (we) won't understand what the point of this is, won't be able to work thru all the missing steps in the few proofs given, and will rant and rave when the authors \\"prove\\" one thing, give one example, and then ask the reader to prove the several follow-up theorems as an exercise.  With, essentially, one example to work from in a subset of each topic, you'll never be able to work through the few questions with answers (which answers are short to the point of worthlessness) and will throw up your hands in dismay when attempting to solve the non-answered end-of-chapter questions.      - Quadrant IV:  if you're a non-genius Math-type, you will join the Quadrant Is in horror at the lack of rigor, but, like the Quadrant IIIs, will be horribly frustrated since you won't be able to force your way through the material on your own.  A definite lose-lose situation, here.    The really odd thing with this book is that, in the universities, Discrete Math (the subject) is usually a required course for Computer Science majors and is a PRE-CALCULUS course.  There's absolutely no way that any such student at that point in his degree could get through this book.  I received my B.S. in Mathematics from the University of Michigan well over 20 years ago (so I've forgotten most everything, plus I was a Quadrant IV type but figured it out much later and migrated to Quadrant III), but there are entire chapters in this book where I only understand words like \\"the\\" and \\"and.\\"  The authors assume an extremely in-depth degree of mathematical knowledge on the part of the reader.  Also, there's nothing to tie the subject matter back to anything a CS person (or any non-math-type) could use in his degree, profession, or life.  So, once again, this book is very poorly matched against any intended audience.    I'd also like to point out that I doubt this book would ever be chosen by any academic institution for teaching.  It just doesn't follow the established norms on how to teach.  Specifically, it should:  1) tell the readers what it's going to say, 2) tell them, and 3) tell them what it just told them.  Each chapter and section in this book just starts out talking about something.  You really have no idea where the authors are going until they actually get there.  What the book really, REALLY needs is for the authors to state exactly what they're going to do in a section and chapter, do it, and then summarize it.  Ditto for the book as a whole.  The preface needs some kind of overall game plan so the people reading the book know where they're going.    Since the publisher hasn't provided the information on Amazon, I've put a scanned copy of the book's Table of Contents in the \\"User Images\\" area at the top of the page.    I rate this book 2 stars out of 5.
This book is one of the two texts in FSU's COP 3502: \\"Introduction to Computer Science\\" course (a required course in their Computer Science degree).  It's mostly a waste of time.  The first two chapters are of some use because they provide a brief history of computers and a quick introduction to the ethical theories one can use to resolve ethical dilemmas. Unfortunately, chapters 3 through 6 (inclusive) are worthless.  They consist of about 190 pages of figuring out why certain obviously wrong activities are wrong (things like sending spam, producing pornography, stealing intellectual property, violating privacy, stealing identities, producing viruses, etc.).  The last three chapters might have some merit, though.  They cover some of the more general ethical consideration of working in the computer science field.  Unfortunately, I stopped reading when the author started bringing up false POLITICAL references.    In general, most of the examples of ethical situations in these chapters are non-computer-related.  Since the author specifically talks about this book being an ethics course as adhering to the IEEE's and ACM's \\"Computing Curricula 2001\\" standard, its examples ought to be drawn from the Information Systems world.  My biggest gripe with these chapters is the obvious political slant of the author.  He's constantly slipping his world-view based assumptions into the text as absolute-truth.  I wonder what the ethics is of implying to students that certain things are true when, at best, they're controversial, and at worst, false?    I truthfully feel sorry for the poor students in FSU's Computer Science degree program who are stuck going through a course with this book and a (most probably) similarly slanted professor.    I give it 1 Star out of 5.
This book is one of the two texts in FSU's COP 3502: \\"Introduction to Computer Science\\" course (a required course in their Computer Science degree).  As the authors state in the preface, they \\"wanted to design a 'CS 0' course that was a true survey course.\\"  They did an excellent job.  Basically, they start with the assumption that the reader has never turned on a computer in his life and take him through its history, how to use it, what programming is about, and how the hardware works.  They even teach a bit of HTML and JavaScript.  There's very little I can say that is bad about the book.  It comes down to some typgraphical errors, an incorrect web address for the online portion of the book (easily figured out from the page their web address takes you to), and my belief that they took out too many steps in describing computer switches, gates, and circuits.  Frankly, I'm amazed that they reasonably went from a neophyte level to a fully-grounded level in one book.  I rate it as 5 stars out of 5.
The three books in Peter F. Hamilton's Greg Mandel series were written before his \\"Night's Dawn\\" series.  I'm not certain of this, but they seem to occur in the same universe as that series, just at a MUCH earlier time.  Regardless, this series is excellent.  What's especially nice, is that, for the most part, each of these books stands alone.  You still need to read them in order, but none of them ends in a cliff-hanger requiring your reading of the next.  Unfortunately, each of these books has a few fairly explicit sexual situations described in them.  The amount of sex increases as you move from book to book.  If it weren't for that, I'd recommend these books for everyone. <br /> <br />\\"Mindstar Rising\\" is the first book in the series.  It's a very good, fast-paced sci-fi action thriller.  The book introduces all the important characters and the \\"universe\\" used throughout the series.  For the most part, the character development is good.  I have a few qualms about a character or two suddenly being more capable than they are during the majority of the book, but that's mostly inconsequential. The plot, too, is very good.  However, the transition between the first, introductory, situation in the book and the primary situation could have been worked better:  it seems contrived.  But, I might be seeing that solely because I've read the book four times now. <br /> <br />\\"A Quantum Murder\\" is the second book in the series. This book takes place about three years after \\"Mindstar Rising.\\"  Instead of being the science-fiction action thriller that the first book is, it's more of a science fiction mystery.  It's a close call, but I think this book is slightly better than \\"Mindstar Rising.\\"  Once again, there's good character development, but this time, the plot is somewhat more tightly put together.  I've only got a couple of quibbles:  first, in one scene, Mandel's psi powers inexplicably include actual telepathy instead of just the empathy described in \\"Mindstar Rising.\\"And, second, after the characters find out who the murderer is, instead of sending the police out immediately, they close up shop for the night and say they'll do it in the morning.  Other than that, this is an excellent book which shows the origins of a lot of the technology in the \\"Night's Dawn\\" series. <br /> <br />\\"The Nano Flower\\" is the third, and final, book in the series.  The various dates specified in the book don't quite agree, but, in general, it seems to takes place about 16 years after \\"A Quantum Murder.\\"  Like \\"Mindstar Rising,\\" it's a sci-fi action thriller.  Like \\"A Quantum Murder,\\" it further develops technologies that Hamilton uses in his \\"Night's Dawn\\" series.  Also, as in \\"A Quantum Murder,\\" Mandel's psi-powers have once again expanded.  Of the three books, this is probably the best.  It's a hard comparison to make since the second book is more of a mystery and this book more of an action-thriller.  But, in general, I'd say there's an incremental improvement in these books as you move through the series (all of them are very good, though).

I realize I'm not in agreement with all the other reviews here, but I just wanted to throw my $0.02 in.  The impression I got from reading the other reviews was that this book would read something like Churchill's \\"Second World War\\" series:  sort of a narrative or story covering the war.  Instead, for the most part, this book is a reference book.  It's got tons of information in it, but it's organized into battles within time periods.  It's hard to explain.  I was looking for something that said we did x because of y which resulted in these battles.  Then, we did x' which led to some other battles.  Instead it said something like in year x we fought battles a, b, and c.  In year y, we fought battles d, e, and f.  All the information is there, but the \\"story\\" part of the \\"history\\" feels lacking.    If you're studying the Korean War, I do agree that this is an excellent book.  But, for a more \\"entertaining\\" study, I'd try something else (what that would be, I don't know).
Currently, there are six books in Brin's Uplift saga.  It's kind of hard to categorize these books as elements of a series, though.  The first three books in the saga, \\"Sundiver,\\" \\"Startide Rising,\\" and \\"The Uplift War,\\" are not really a trilogy or a series in the normal sense.  Instead, \\"Sundiver\\" relates to the rest of the saga as Tolkien's \\"The Hobbit\\" relates to his \\"Lord of the Rings:\\" it sets the stage for all the rest of the books in the saga.  \\"Startide Rising\\" and \\"The Uplift War\\" describe completely different plotlines originating from the same event far distant, time wise and space wise, from \\"Sundiver\\".  In a pinch, you could read these books in any order and not really miss anything.  They describe different points in time and space of the same Universe.  Of course, the best order is the one listed, above. <br /> <br />Unlike the first three books in the saga, the second three books DO form a series.  The first of this trilogy, \\"Brightness Reef,\\" picks up with yet another totally independent plotline and brand new characters.  However, it does contain a central character who ties the first three books into this set. Unfortunately, Brin doesn't say, specifically, who that character is until the very end of the book.  Even worse, the last time the character was used was so far back in the saga that it's hard to remember anything about him.  The remaining two books, \\"Infinity's Shore\\" and \\"Heaven's Reach,\\" continue sequentially from the first and form a tightly knit trilogy with no breaks in time. <br /> <br />None of these books is \\"happy\\" or \\"light reading.\\"  For the most part, they're all intense, heavily detailed and fully characterized books. \\"Sundiver\\" is the least \\"heavy\\" and most lacking in the realistic feel of the rest of the books.  But, for the most part, if you like \\"Sundiver,\\" you'll definitely want to continue with the rest of the saga.  Even if you don't like \\"Sundiver,\\" I highly recommend you read at least \\"Startide Rising:\\"  it has an entirely different feel to it and might be more to your liking.  This saga is just too important to miss out on.  As a whole, it's one of the great works of science fiction and one of the few pieces of science fiction that belong in the class of true literature. <br /> <br />The following are some comments on the individual books: <br /> <br />Sundiver:  Somewhat different from the other books in the saga in that it's more of a science fiction mystery than a science fiction drama.  This book sets the stage for the rest of the saga as it chronicles events that happen several hundred years before what happens in the other books.  About the only thing negative I can come up with is that I wish Brin had written several prequels to it so we could read about the earlier adventures of Jacob Demwa that are referenced in this book. <br /> <br />Startide Rising:  This book focuses on the group that starts all the other events noted in the remaining books of the saga.  Though the main characters start off in a very bad way, Brin does a good job of moving them forward, and upward, throughout the book. <br /> <br />The Uplift War:  The events in this book start from the same event that kicks off \\"Startide Rising.\\"  But, other than that, the two books are totally independent.  Like \\"Startide Rising,\\" Brin produced a gripping plot, great character development, and a good progression towards a positive goal. <br /> <br />Brightness Reef:  This is definitely not a happy book.  It starts out with many non-pleasant activities and fights its way forward from there.  The biggest problem I have with it is that it's very hard to see how anything good or positive is going to happen to the main characters, no matter how much they try. <br /> <br />Infinity's Shore:  First, the negative:  once this book starts, it's very apparent that a whole lot of relevant stuff has been happening elsewhere that we missed.  Essentially, there's at least one entire book that sounds extremely interesting that'smissing from the saga.  Brin fills in most of this back-story during this book and \\"Heaven's Reach.\\"  But, I'd sure like to have read that missing book.  On the positive side, this book re-introduces us to old friends and subtly changes the focus to them.  Everything's still happening in the same place with mostly the same characters, but the attitude changes and becomes more can-do. <br /> <br />Heaven's Reach:  One difficulty with this book is due to how it continues from the previous book.  It's merely a change of venue instead of a new set of adventures.  A quote from one of the main characters near the end of this book sort of sums up my feelings about it:  \\"...what will one more worry matter?  I've long passed the point where I stopped counting them.\\"  Essentially, by the time this book and saga starts winding down (and even at the point of that quotation, it really hasn't started that yet), the reader is totally fatigued by never-ending problems.  I really like these works, but the lack of a tie-up between \\"Infinity's Shore\\" and this book is grinding.

As a whole, it's one of the great works of science fiction and one of the few pieces of science fiction that belong in the class of true literature. <br /> <br />The following are some comments on the individual books: <br /> <br />Sundiver:  Somewhat different from the other books in the saga in that it's more of a science fiction mystery than a science fiction drama.  This book sets the stage for the rest of the saga as it chronicles events that happen several hundred years before what happens in the other books.  About the only thing negative I can come up with is that I wish Brin had written several prequels to it so we could read about the earlier adventures of Jacob Demwa that are referenced in this book. <br /> <br />Startide Rising:  This book focuses on the group that starts all the other events noted in the remaining books of the saga.  Though the main characters start off in a very bad way, Brin does a good job of moving them forward, and upward, throughout the book. <br /> <br />The Uplift War:  The events in this book start from the same event that kicks off \\"Startide Rising.\\"  But, other than that, the two books are totally independent.  Like \\"Startide Rising,\\" Brin produced a gripping plot, great character development, and a good progression towards a positive goal. <br /> <br />Brightness Reef:  This is definitely not a happy book.  It starts out with many non-pleasant activities and fights its way forward from there.  The biggest problem I have with it is that it's very hard to see how anything good or positive is going to happen to the main characters, no matter how much they try. <br /> <br />Infinity's Shore:  First, the negative:  once this book starts, it's very apparent that a whole lot of relevant stuff has been happening elsewhere that we missed.  Essentially, there's at least one entire book that sounds extremely interesting that'smissing from the saga.  Brin fills in most of this back-story during this book and \\"Heaven's Reach.\\"  But, I'd sure like to have read that missing book.  On the positive side, this book re-introduces us to old friends and subtly changes the focus to them.  Everything's still happening in the same place with mostly the same characters, but the attitude changes and becomes more can-do. <br /> <br />Heaven's Reach:  One difficulty with this book is due to how it continues from the previous book.  It's merely a change of venue instead of a new set of adventures.  A quote from one of the main characters near the end of this book sort of sums up my feelings about it:  \\"...what will one more worry matter?  I've long passed the point where I stopped counting them.\\"  Essentially, by the time this book and saga starts winding down (and even at the point of that quotation, it really hasn't started that yet), the reader is totally fatigued by never-ending problems.  I really like these works, but the lack of a tie-up between \\"Infinity's Shore\\" and this book is grinding.
Currently, there are six books in Brin's Uplift saga.  It's kind of hard to categorize these books as elements of a series, though.  The first three books in the saga, \\"Sundiver,\\" \\"Startide Rising,\\" and \\"The Uplift War,\\" are not really a trilogy or a series in the normal sense.  Instead, \\"Sundiver\\" relates to the rest of the saga as Tolkien's \\"The Hobbit\\" relates to his \\"Lord of the Rings:\\" it sets the stage for all the rest of the books in the saga.  \\"Startide Rising\\" and \\"The Uplift War\\" describe completely different plotlines originating from the same event far distant, time wise and space wise, from \\"Sundiver\\".  In a pinch, you could read these books in any order and not really miss anything.  They describe different points in time and space of the same Universe.  Of course, the best order is the one listed, above. <br /> <br />Unlike the first three books in the saga, the second three books DO form a series.  The first of this trilogy, \\"Brightness Reef,\\" picks up with yet another totally independent plotline and brand new characters.  However, it does contain a central character who ties the first three books into this set. Unfortunately, Brin doesn't say, specifically, who that character is until the very end of the book.  Even worse, the last time the character was used was so far back in the saga that it's hard to remember anything about him.  The remaining two books, \\"Infinity's Shore\\" and \\"Heaven's Reach,\\" continue sequentially from the first and form a tightly knit trilogy with no breaks in time. <br /> <br />None of these books is \\"happy\\" or \\"light reading.\\"  For the most part, they're all intense, heavily detailed and fully characterized books. \\"Sundiver\\" is the least \\"heavy\\" and most lacking in the realistic feel of the rest of the books.  But, for the most part, if you like \\"Sundiver,\\" you'll definitely want to continue with the rest of the saga.

The premise of this book is an interesting one.  Unfortunately, Brin's writing talents at the time weren't what they are now.  Basically, the writing is trite and juvenile.  Looking at the copyright dates of his books, it looks like \\"The Practice Effect\\" is either his third or his fourth novel.  The first novel was \\"Sundiver\\" (1980).  The second was \\"Startide Rising\\" (1983).  Then in 1984, he wrote (apparently) both this book and \\"The Uplift War.\\"  From a technical perspective (i.e., the style of the writing), it's hard to believe that he wrote this book right in the middle of his Uplift War saga.  The writing style is far closer to that in his 1980 \\"Sundiver\\" (and \\"Sundiver\\" is FAR better than this book) than it is to his 1984 \\"The Uplift War.\\"  My guess is that he wrote this well before the rest, had it lying on a shelf, and just pushed it out to capitalize on his popularity.    Just for the sake of a comparison to his later works, and because the concept is so interesting, I do recommend people read it.  Just don't expect too much out of it.
This is the 8th in Cook's Garrett series (\\"Sweet Silver Blues,\\" \\"Bitter Gold Hearts,\\" \\"Cold Copper Tears,\\" \\"Old Tin Sorrows,\\" \\"Dread Brass Shadows,\\" \\"Red Iron Nights,\\" \\"Deadly Quicksilver Lies,\\" \\"Petty Pewter Gods,\\" \\"Faded Steel Heat,\\" \\"Angry Lead Skies,\\" and \\"Whispering Nickel Idols\\"). This is a good book that's fun to read.  Unfortunately, it's not quite as good as other books in Cook's Garrett series.  In many places, you can see that Cook wrote bits and pieces of the book and then cut-and-pasted them into the final order.  It's not a big problem -- it's just that the roughness is a bit disconcerting.  A more irritating problem is that Garrett is working with a couple of pantheons of gods which I just couldn't keep straight.  The individual gods, and the pantheons they belong to, just blend together and I couldn't tell who was doing what to whom.  The biggest problem, though, is that the ending just appears out of thin air in the last 10 pages of the book.  As I got closer and closer to the physical end, I kept wondering if this was going to be a two-parter:  there was just no indication of a reasonable solution.  With a sudden flurry of activity, the Dead Man and Garrett take a guess at what's going on and all heck breaks loose (which confirms their theory).  Not a very satisfying ending at all.  Still, I did enjoy reading the book and do recommend it (but read the earlier books, first).  I rate this book at 4 stars out of 5.    BTW: At the time of this review, this book is long out of print. It's tough to find anywhere. As an alternative, look around for the SFBC's \\"Garrett Investigates.\\" This book is part of that collection.
\\"Catspaw\\" is a MUCH better book than its prequel, \\"Psion.\\"  As with \\"Psion,\\" I don't care much for its theme that humans, especially wealthy powerful ones, are evil.  But, for \\"Catspaw,\\" that's pretty much overridden by how well Vinge writes and by the tightness of the plot.  About the only thing I didn't like in the book was the occasional lapse into unnecessary sexual details in about five different places.  Other than that, this is a very well-written book that I highly recommend.  If it weren't for the sense of loss a reader would suffer without having read \\"Psion,\\" I'd suggest skipping that book entirely.  Most of the necessary information comes out in this book.  But, it's not complete until almost halfway through the book.
&quot;Psion&quot; is merely an OK book. It's not bad, but it's certainly not good. The biggest problem is the overall shallowness, or even triteness, of everthing: theme, plot, and character development. The theme is essentially that humans are evil, especially if they have any kind of wealth or power. The plot's not that bad, though there are jumps where people do things that are just plain stupid. The worst part of the book is the character development. The characters DO develop. It's just that that development seems to be a step function (i.e., you don't see the character learn through experience: they just behave differently later in the book). Plus, I don't really like the main character as a person: he's essentially a victim and doesn't want to take any of the opportunities to improve himself that he's offered throughout the book. Even worse, though, is the villain. He nothing but a cardboard cutout. Not only does Vinge not develop his character thoughout the book, she's also given him no character in the first place. There's also a problem with several groups that ought to have been central to the book. Two that spring to mind are the aliens and the mine management on Cinder. Neither of these groups are given any kind of development. Vinge needs them to do certain things for the plot to proceed and so, Twin-Pines, they do them (some of the things she has the mine management do are absolutely not in their own best interest). <br />  <br /> Since this book is really required if you want to read the second book in the series, &quot;Catspaw,&quot; I still recommend you read it. Again, it's not a bad book. I wouldn't call it a light read, but at least it's not heavy.
I can't believe it.  Prior to my reading this novel, I've loved most everything Cherryh has written.  This is the first of her works that I haven't at least liked.  It started out well:  I was fully engrossed in the protagonist's trip through the desert.  But then, after that, Cherryh had them travel back (with a probable trip back, again).  Half way through that first return trip, I said enough was enough, nothing's happening, and put the book away.  Aside from the utter lack of a meaningful plot, I just couldn't fathom WHY this was happening:  one group of galactics needs to contact another, apparently fugitive, galactic and they take 30 years to do it via nanobots in the general population who then have to walk across the desert and die in droves to even find out that someone wants someone else to receive a message?  Huh?  Why didn't those galactics use some equivalent of a radio?  At the very least they could have tried walking up to the front door and talking.  How about skywriting?  Dropping a message capsule on the city?  Literally anything would have been more efficient than what they did.  I don't know why Cherryh wrote this the way she did, but I hope it's not repeated.
Unfortunately, this book is basically a political tract and not any kind of mystery. Even worse, the politics presented just reinforce my belief in how miserable this world is due to PC. To add insult to injury, the mysteries Flynn is trying to solve are trivial (essentially there for McDonald to wrap his politics around) and Flynn's wry attitude are taken to such an extreme that they go right past &quot;two-dimensional&quot; and into &quot;one-dimensional&quot; (i.e., the characterization are worse than flat). I suppose if you're a die-hard Flynn fan, you'll want to read this. But otherwise, I'd suggest staying far away: it's just too depressing to read.
Like its predecessor, &quot;Phule's Company,&quot; this book is a light, fun read.  The only thing I really didn't like about it was the very end.  If Asprin had left out the last page and a half, I'd have been very happy.  However, he added that last bit to provide a hook to later books.  I just don't think he needed that and it detracted from the ending of this book.  Other than that, though, I recommend this book for anyone looking for some light reading.
I had high hopes for this book.  Unfortunately, they were quickly dashed.  I don't know why Weis didn't team up with Hickman as is her wont.  But, the lack of a second author dooms the effort.  The book has an interesting premise, but is filled with inconsistencies, triteness, and plain ol' stupidity.  If Hickman had been around, they could have bounced the material off each other and corrected most of the bad writing before it hit the shelves.  As it is, it's practically un-stomachable.  I put the book away about half way through it as not being worth the effort.  But, I later picked it up and finished it in the hope it would get better.  It didn't.  It got worse.  I was practically gagging by the end.  Stay away from this book and its series.
If phrases like:  &quot;By lightly touching the Third Eye Point, for instance,... you can enhance your inner awareness.... and within a few weeks, you may notice that your intuition will begin to increase,&quot; sound reasonable to you, then this book is for you.  If your mindset lies somewhere beyond 12th century China, avoid this book like the plague.  All the other reviews here indicate that the people who wrote them believe accupressure works.  Maybe it does.  But, this book does nothing to explain or prove it in scientific terms.  Instead, it spouts mystical mumbo-jumbo as cause and effect.  If you're in chronic pain, and don't believe in fairy tales, then, instead of this book, I highly recommend &quot;The Trigger Point Therapy Workbook: Your Self-Treatment Guide for Pain Relief&quot; by Clair Davies here on Amazon (ISBN:  1572242507).  That book actually uses honest-to-goodness medical research for its recommendations.
John Varley is one of my favorite authors.  I like his work so much, I actually bought this book before reading the reviews here.  That was a mistake.  This is juvenile fiction that's not even fit for juvenile's to read (i.e., too much sex).  Some of the reviews compare this work to Heinlein's early, juvenile fiction, days.  It just doesn't compute.  Heinlein's early works were 1) interesting, and 2) not just for juvenile's but also boy-scoutish (i.e., clean).  Varley's \\"Red Thunder\\" is neither.  I can understand Varley's sexual themes in \\"Steel Beach\\" and \\"The Golden Globe:\\"  he's writing about advanced, bored societies at an adult level.  But, here, he's just going on and on about, essentially, the live's of a small group of late adolescents.  Heck, it takes him over half the book to get to a point where the characters actually start to get ready to do what they're going to do.  Note that I said \\"start to get ready,\\" not \\"start:\\"  the half-way point is when they actually get a glimmer of what they're going to do.  What a bore.<br />I suppose Varley figured he needed a bit of juvenile fiction to round out his audience base.  Unfortunately, he would have been better served by cutting out the first 150 pages of the book and deleting all the sex.  If he wanted \\"character\\" (hah) development with these kids, he should have ignored their poor, downtrodded lives and developed their characters while they actually did something that furthered the plot.<br />Stay away from this book.
An enjoyable, light book.  There's nothing really wrong with the book, but it's certainly not literature.  If you're tired of wading through books that make you think too much, try this one.  A great way to spend an afternoon.
In all probability, people who read the first of the Death Gate Cycle books and like it, are going to want to read all of the books in the series (regardless of any flucutation in the individual books' ratings).  Ditto for the reverse:  if people don't like the first book, then they're probably not going to want to read any of the other books in the series.  Thus, instead of individual book ratings, I've rated the whole series and given a short blurb on any specifics for each book.<br />Overall, this is a very good series.  The authors were amazingly creative in coming up with this concept and the books are well-written, extremely interesting, and internally consistent (mostly -- see below for some exceptions).  I highly recommend this series of books for everyone.  My comments for the indidual books follow:<br />Vol. 1 -- Dragon Wing:  This book covers the exploration of Arianus:  the realm of Air.  It introduces us to the two main characters (Haplo and Alfred) and many of the recurring characters throughout the series.  It's a well-paced, well-written book that's an excellent reresentation of what to expect in most of the rest of the series.  Essentially, if you like this book, you'll like the other six books.  If you don't like this book, then there's no sense in reading any of the others.<br />Vol. 2 -- Elven Star:  This book covers the exploration of Pryan:  the realm of Fire.  Alfred is entirely missing from this book, and Haplo isn't really the centerpiece.  Instead, the book is mostly written from the perspective of the mensch and of the newly introduced (and recurring) Zifnab.  The one possible weakness in the book is that Weis/Hickman wrote it such that the structure of Pryan itself is more of a mystery than Arianus was in the first book.<br />Vol. 3 -- Fire Sea:  This book covers the exploration of Abarrach:  the realm of Stone.  Once again, both Haplo and Alfred are present.  The characters and areas presented in this book are key elements for the entireseries.  An interesting book, but not a very happy one at all.<br />Vol. 4 -- Serpent Mage:  This book covers the exploration of Chelestra:  the realm of Water.  Both Alfred and Haplo are on this world.  But, for the most part, they follow separate plot lines.  There's a lot of action taking place throughout the book and Weis/Hickman introduce some actual Sartan (besides Alfred).  They also bring in an ancient evil to balance the ancient good introduced in the previous book.  The most irritating thing about this book is that it ends in a cliff-hanger.  The previous books tied up their worlds' activities fairly nicely.  Not so in this book.  It ends at a very inconvenient spot.<br />Vol. 5 -- Hand of Chaos:  This book returns Haplo to Arianus and the people he met there earlier.  Whereas the first four books of the series cover the exploration of the four realms, this book starts the synthesis of the various threads from those books into a movement towards closure.  It's a good book, but, unfortunately, it doesn't do anything with Alfred.  The previous book left Alfred heading towards a bad end.  This book doesn't do anything with that.  So, while reading the book, you constantly have this little voice in the back of your mind going &quot;what's happening with Alfred?&quot;  Irritating.<br />Vol. 6 -- Into the Labyrinth:  This book ranges across just about all of the worlds of the Death Gate.  It brings all of the various threads from the other books to a head.  Most importantly, it finally does something with Alfred.  The unfortunate thing about this book is that it contains a lot of technical errors (or, more specifically, contradictions).  For instance, in Dragon Wing, we're told that a person needs to be familiar with an area to use a transportation spell to get to that area.  Yet, very close to the beginning of the book, one of the characters uses such a spell without ever having been to her target location.  There are also several instances where the characters COULD have used such a spell, but don't.  Likewise, there are problems with replication spells.  In Fire Sea, Haplo and Alfred use such a spell to replicate enough food for a large group of people.  Yet, in this book, no one seems to consider using a replication spell to produce more of some food.  But, later on, those same people are using that same spell to replicate weapons.  Plus, at one point, Xar uses a spell to just materialize both food and drink for a party.  But, if such a thing is possible, why do the Patryns hunt and, apparently, farm in the Labyrinth?  Also, the size of the Labyrinth seems wrong.  From the previous books, it's taken hundreds (if not thousands) of years for various Patryns to traverse the hundreds of Gates in the Labryrinth.  Yet, in this book, from the very beginning of the Labyrinth they can see the results of things happening at the Final Gate.  There's also the problem of how people at the center of the Labyrinth would know anything about the Final Gate.<br />Vol. 7 -- Seventh Gate:  This is the conclusion of the Death Gate series.  Unforunately, I didn't much care for it.  Basically, it comes across as being pretty sappy.  All of a sudden, Haplo and Alfred are best buds and want to teach the world to sing in perfect harmony.  Most of the various threads are tied up adequately (if not very satifyingly).  But, the sudden push towards liberal &quot;peace, love, and harmony&quot; is trite.  Of the seven books in this series, this one is the least good.  Once again, I didn't much care for the tone of this book.  But, since it adequatly ties up most everything that needed tying up, I'm not going to downgrade the whole series because of that.
In all probability, people who read the first of the Death Gate Cycle books and like it, are going to want to read all of the books in the series (regardless of any flucutation in the individual books' ratings).  Ditto for the reverse:  if people don't like the first book, then they're probably not going to want to read any of the other books in the series.  Thus, instead of individual book ratings, I've rated the whole series and given a short blurb on any specifics for each book.<br />Overall, this is a very good series.  The authors were amazingly creative in coming up with this concept and the books are well-written, extremely interesting, and internally consistent (mostly -- see below for some exceptions).  I highly recommend this series of books for everyone.  My comments for the indidual books follow:<br />Vol. 1 -- Dragon Wing:  This book covers the exploration of Arianus:  the realm of Air.  It introduces us to the two main characters (Haplo and Alfred) and many of the recurring characters throughout the series.  It's a well-paced, well-written book that's an excellent reresentation of what to expect in most of the rest of the series.  Essentially, if you like this book, you'll like the other six books.  If you don't like this book, then there's no sense in reading any of the others.<br />Vol. 2 -- Elven Star:  This book covers the exploration of Pryan:  the realm of Fire.  Alfred is entirely missing from this book, and Haplo isn't really the centerpiece.  Instead, the book is mostly written from the perspective of the mensch and of the newly introduced (and recurring) Zifnab.  The one possible weakness in the book is that Weis/Hickman wrote it such that the structure of Pryan itself is more of a mystery than Arianus was in the first book.<br />Vol. 3 -- Fire Sea:  This book covers the exploration of Abarrach:  the realm of Stone.  Once again, both Haplo and Alfred are present.  The characters and areas presented in this book are key elements for the entireseries.  An interesting book, but not a very happy one at all.<br />Vol. 4 -- Serpent Mage:  This book covers the exploration of Chelestra:  the realm of Water.  Both Alfred and Haplo are on this world.  But, for the most part, they follow separate plot lines.  There's a lot of action taking place throughout the book and Weis/Hickman introduce some actual Sartan (besides Alfred).  They also bring in an ancient evil to balance the ancient good introduced in the previous book.  The most irritating thing about this book is that it ends in a cliff-hanger.  The previous books tied up their worlds' activities fairly nicely.  Not so in this book.

Alfred is entirely missing from this book, and Haplo isn't really the centerpiece.  Instead, the book is mostly written from the perspective of the mensch and of the newly introduced (and recurring) Zifnab.  The one possible weakness in the book is that Weis/Hickman wrote it such that the structure of Pryan itself is more of a mystery than Arianus was in the first book.<br />Vol. 3 -- Fire Sea:  This book covers the exploration of Abarrach:  the realm of Stone.  Once again, both Haplo and Alfred are present.  The characters and areas presented in this book are key elements for the entireseries.  An interesting book, but not a very happy one at all.<br />Vol. 4 -- Serpent Mage:  This book covers the exploration of Chelestra:  the realm of Water.  Both Alfred and Haplo are on this world.  But, for the most part, they follow separate plot lines.  There's a lot of action taking place throughout the book and Weis/Hickman introduce some actual Sartan (besides Alfred).  They also bring in an ancient evil to balance the ancient good introduced in the previous book.  The most irritating thing about this book is that it ends in a cliff-hanger.  The previous books tied up their worlds' activities fairly nicely.  Not so in this book.  It ends at a very inconvenient spot.<br />Vol. 5 -- Hand of Chaos:  This book returns Haplo to Arianus and the people he met there earlier.  Whereas the first four books of the series cover the exploration of the four realms, this book starts the synthesis of the various threads from those books into a movement towards closure.  It's a good book, but, unfortunately, it doesn't do anything with Alfred.  The previous book left Alfred heading towards a bad end.  This book doesn't do anything with that.  So, while reading the book, you constantly have this little voice in the back of your mind going &quot;what's happening with Alfred?&quot;  Irritating.<br />Vol. 6 -- Into the Labyrinth:  This book ranges across just about all of the worlds of the Death Gate.  It brings all of the various threads from the other books to a head.  Most importantly, it finally does something with Alfred.  The unfortunate thing about this book is that it contains a lot of technical errors (or, more specifically, contradictions).  For instance, in Dragon Wing, we're told that a person needs to be familiar with an area to use a transportation spell to get to that area.  Yet, very close to the beginning of the book, one of the characters uses such a spell without ever having been to her target location.  There are also several instances where the characters COULD have used such a spell, but don't.  Likewise, there are problems with replication spells.  In Fire Sea, Haplo and Alfred use such a spell to replicate enough food for a large group of people.  Yet, in this book, no one seems to consider using a replication spell to produce more of some food.  But, later on, those same people are using that same spell to replicate weapons.  Plus, at one point, Xar uses a spell to just materialize both food and drink for a party.  But, if such a thing is possible, why do the Patryns hunt and, apparently, farm in the Labyrinth?  Also, the size of the Labyrinth seems wrong.  From the previous books, it's taken hundreds (if not thousands) of years for various Patryns to traverse the hundreds of Gates in the Labryrinth.  Yet, in this book, from the very beginning of the Labyrinth they can see the results of things happening at the Final Gate.  There's also the problem of how people at the center of the Labyrinth would know anything about the Final Gate.<br />Vol. 7 -- Seventh Gate:  This is the conclusion of the Death Gate series.  Unforunately, I didn't much care for it.  Basically, it comes across as being pretty sappy.  All of a sudden, Haplo and Alfred are best buds and want to teach the world to sing in perfect harmony.  Most of the various threads are tied up adequately (if not very satifyingly).  But, the sudden push towards liberal &quot;peace, love, and harmony&quot; is trite.  Of the seven books in this series, this one is the least good.  Once again, I didn't much care for the tone of this book.  But, since it adequatly ties up most everything that needed tying up, I'm not going to downgrade the whole series because of that.
I'm sorry to say that this book isn't in the same league as C.S. Friedman's other books.  First of all, I have problems with the back story:  originally, mankind set out for the stars but then found that the star drive they were using mutated their genes.  OK.  But, then, why did all the people on any given ship have their genes mutate in the exact same way so that they produced a viable, fertile species?  It seems to me, you would have ended up with a lot of unique, sterile, monsters.  Oh, well. But, I think my biggest problem with the book is that it just doesn't grab my attention.  As I read it (and the writing, per se, is good), I basically felt nothing.  Everything, including the main character,  is bland.  I did enjoy the book, but that was purely from a mechanistic point of view.  The story and characters never really meant anything to me.  I hope Friedman can raise the excitement level in her future works to match that found in her other past works.  This book, for all the work she obviously put into it, is basically filler.
I love this book.  I've read it four or five times now and find it better each time.  The only reason I don't give it five stars is that it IS a bit hokey (i.e., simplistic).  But, its sheer massiveness and level of fun outweighs that.  A science fiction classic that is well worth reading.  WARNING:  under no circumstances watch the movie -- that thing sucks.
Shon'jir, the 2nd book in the &quot;Faded Sun&quot; trilogy, is much better than Kesrith (the 1st book).  It's not a matter of writing styles or ability (which are the same in both books: very good).  It's just that in Shon'jir something actually happens.  It even ends at a reasonable point (for the 2nd book in a trilogy).  In the 1st book, Cherryh basically introduces the mri and the main characters  In this book, she brings us through Duncan's journey (in all senses) towards the mri.  A very good, very interesting book.
Kutath, the final book in the &quot;Faded Sun&quot; series, picks up where the 2nd book, &quot;Shon'jir,&quot; leaves off.  In this book, Duncan has completed his journey towards the mri and Cherryh takes us towards a final resolution of the mri/human/regul relationship.  The book is just as well-written and interesting as &quot;Shon'jir.&quot;  About the only negative I can come up with is the somewhat drawn-out initial tableau involving walking across the desert:  it gets a bit tedious after a while.  A very good book.
The title for my review pretty much says it all:  the first book of this trilogy is SLOW, but after that, Cherryh picks it right up and produces an excellent trilogy.  Well worth reading.  I've included my individual reviews of each title in the book, below:<br />&quot;If something had actually happened in &quot;Kesrith,&quot; I'm sure it would have been a great book. Well, I'm probably exaggerating a bit. But, for the first 170 pages of this 250 page book, absolutely nothing happens. It's essentially the background social, political, and military information of all the major players. Around page 170 and for the next 80 pages, lots of really interesting things happen. Unfortunately, they don't really end. This book is merely the prologue for its sequels. I have no problem with book trilogies. But, there has to be SOME kind of closure in each of the books. This book just gets going and then stops. Highly frustrating.&quot;<br />&quot;Shon'jir, the 2nd book in the &quot;Faded Sun&quot; trilogy, is much better than Kesrith (the 1st book).

For the most part, I found this book to be much more engrossing than the other two.  However, throughout it, I was worried about what the authors were going to do for the ending.  I was right to worry.  Essentially, Weis/Hickman just took a mechanistic approach to getting the ending done.  Everyone in the book seems to have the same idea  for winning the game: get to a certain place and do a certain thing.  The only difference being the interpretation they put on things.  And that's what happened.  Basically, we have multiple paths leading, linearly, to the same point.  I had hoped that the point would expand out to a big knot with twists and turns, plots and fights.  But, unfortunately, it didn't happen.  Everyone gets where they're going, waives their respective hands in the air, does the obvious, and, presto-chango, it's done.  Phizzle.  That, plus the constant introduction and subsequent dropping of various ***main*** characters throughout the book, makes it quite a let-down.  In general, a decent trilogy.  But, especially because of the ending, nothing to write home to Mom about.
Like the first book in the series, &quot;Well of Darkness,&quot; I enjoyed reading it.  Overall, it was written somewhat better than the earlier work.  Weis/Hickman dropped a lot of the simplistic/childish atmosphere in the first book and wrote this one more for adults (that could be a function of the main characters actually BEING children in the first book).  There are several logic holes/disagreements that irritate me about this book.  But, they're easily forgiven.  Also, the first book tended to portray Good as stupid and Evil as clever.  In this book, the authors modified that a bit so that Good was merely weak, but, unfortunately, Evil is both clever and overwhelming.  I don't know if that's an improvement or not.  I'll have to wait until I finish the third book before I figure that out.  If you've read the first book, this one is definitely worth reading, too.
I was really worried that this book might have been a standard new-age, make-a-buck, quack title.  Thank goodness that turned out to be a groundless worry.  This is an excellent book (with medical references) that does a very good job of helping you get rid of pain.  I had hurt my lower back by performing the arduous task of putting on my underwear.  The doctors and physical therapist couldn't really come up with a reason for it.  After a month, it still wasn't getting any better.  Searching the web gave me references to this book.  Within three days of reading it and poking around in my UPPER (not LOWER) back, my thighs, and my abdomen, the pain has faded to just a reminder.  I'm still not able to bend and reach like I used to.  But, I'm exercising and stretching again, so hopefully that'll change.  Best of all, it no longer hurts just to SIT (or lie down or stand, for that matter).  After showing my wife that her lower body has just about every active trigger point known, she's also reading the book and working on her points.  Hopefully, her pain will reduce in a couple of days, too.<br />The only reason I gave this book four stars instead of five is that it's kind of hard to find and reference ALL the trigger points associated with a specfic pain FOR THE FIRST TIME.  The book does have a diagram for pain locations at the start of each chapter.  But, in many cases, the pain will be caused by multiple trigger points in multiple body locations.  It takes quite a bit of paging through the book to figure out what you're supposed to do.  Once you figure it out, though, the book is great.  Of course, in the author's defense, I can't come up with a better organization method outside of having some kind of software with an anatomical display using hyperlinks.<br />I HIGHLY RECOMMEND this book if you suffer from any kind of chronic pain.  Even if your doctor has pronounced judgement that he/she knows what's causing things, try this book.  As the author says, trigger pointtherapy should be the first course of treatment:  it's easy and cheap.
The idea behind this novel (a cosmos where the gravitational constant is one billion times that of ours), is extremely interesting.  Baxter should definitely be applauded for coming up with something like this and fleshing it out somewhat.  Unfortunately, his writing skills are lacking.  First, the overall flavor of the novel is somewhat juvenile.  Characters are flat but also inconsistent (similar to what one reviewer here said, the main character is a genius leader one minute but an idiot child the next).  Second, the plot basically is held together through miraculous happenings.<br />But, worst of all, since Baxter is a physicist, is that Baxter's physics are inconsistent (i.e., wrong in some places).  For instance, the Belt is a linked set of facilities in orbit around a &quot;star&quot; (which is, itself, in orbit around the center of the cosmos, the Core).  There's a microgravity field from the Belt's own mass pulling things from above and below.  Yet, somehow, the miners drop a chair down to the &quot;star&quot; by cable.  Orbits don't work that way.  Assuming they could get the chair away from the belt (and a simple push would probaby be enough), all it would do is go into an elliptical orbit crossing the Belt's orbit.  To get to the surface of the &quot;star,&quot; they'd need some kind of thrust (and I won't even go into how the cable would end up wrapping around the &quot;star&quot; as the chair changed orbits).<br />Another example from the Belt is when they're trying to deliver a very heavy food machine.  The thing is floating above the Belt.  That means it's co-orbital with it.  The ropes holding the machine break and the thing falls past the Belt, past the star, and down to the Core.  Sorry.  But since it's co-orbital, the darn thing would just float around there.  Baxter uses that co-orbital floating trick later in the book when a couple of the characters float around &quot;above&quot; the Belt until rescued.<br />There are similar physics problems at the Raft.  First, and very obviously, there is a &quot;star&quot; which is &quot;falling&quot; towards the Raft.  It stays there for most of the book.  But, since the Raft is orbiting the Core, there's no way something falling toward the Core from a higher orbit would stay fixed above the Raft.  Since the gravitational constant is so huge in this cosmos, orbiting bodies move VERY quickly.  That &quot;star&quot; would be spiralling all over the heavens on its way down.<br />In another Raft case, some bad people are trying to make some others &quot;walk the plank&quot; off the edge of the Raft.  So what?  Again, this thing's in orbit.  Walk off the edge, and aside from local gravitational effects, you'd just hang there.  This is very similar to a point near the end when the people break a big chunk of the Raft off.  It goes plummeting &quot;down&quot; and people fall though the hole to their death.  Once again, orbits don't work this way.<br />There are a lot of other lesser things that are wrong about the physics (the atmosphere is in orbit, too -- where's the weather?), but those are the big ones.  With the plot and character problems, these essentially make the book not really worth reading.  It's a shame, since the idea behind the book is so clever.  But, I just can't recommend the book.
One of these days, I'm going to learn to never buy a book before reading the reviews on Amazon.  Unfortunately, I was in a used book store, saw this, and bought it on the spot.  What a mistake.  I'm currently on page 382 of 518 and that's as far as I'm going.  I'm not going to read through yet another rape, yet another child eating, yet another set of torment/torture, yet another scene of how rotten Stephen Baxter thinks mankind (and all it's various ancestral lines) is.  Also, I'm tired of reading through all that stuff without any progress in the plot.  Basically, I'm 74% of the way through the book, and nothing's happened to 1) re-unite the main man with the main woman, or 2) tell us who, why, or how the moon is flying through the multiverse picking up and dumping off hominids. Unless you're into being alternately bored and disgusted all while being confused, don't bother with this book.
The first part of this book (up through about page 119) is pretty good.  It starts out where H.G. Wells leaves off with his \\"Time Machine\\" and puts the Traveller into a different Leg of the Trousers of Time (LToT) from what he first went down.  However, after that Baxter becomes internally inconsistent.  The Traveller goes back to where he first gets involved in his Time Machine.  Then someone from a different LToT comes back and rips that leg of the pants right off.  Yet, everyone moves into that now missing LToT and is bored to death in it by Londonian details for a hundred pages or so.  Then, we go WAAAAAY back and mess with various things that ought to have smashed that same LToT for sure.  Instead, things come back from it yet again.  Really, the book would have been better with the whole middle two-thirds missing.  This is especially true since an awful lot of it (well, actually, an awful lot of the whole book) involves bashing humans as the worst thing ever developed.<br /><br />I'm really not all that enamoured of the book.  However, the cleverness of extending H.G. Wells' \\"Time Machine\\" the way he did lets me bring my rating up from two stars to three stars.  Somewhat boring, but interesting.
I've got only two small nits with this book.  First, the characters seem to be somewhat stilted in behavior.  However, it's very possible this is just a function of the genre.  It's not all that bad, but it is noticeable.  Second, throughout the book, Good is usually depicted as being somewhat stupid, and Evil is not necessarily portrayed as bad, but instead is portrayed as somewhat clever.  I guess it's a philosophical difference between me and the authors (or what they're trying to do with this series).  Overall, though, the book is still very well done.  I enjoyed it.
The two stories in this volume are totally independent of each other.  In the forward, Cherryh tries to paper over this by saying in the vast reaches of human space, totally different things can be happening at the same time.  In reality, these stories just have nothing to do with each other.  Outside of being some of Cherryh's very earliest work, they have no business being in the same book.  HOWEVER, from the point-of-view of price and of getting these books back in print, I think the publisher had a good idea in doing this.  Each of the stories is interesting and about equally well done.  If you haven't read these books, then this volume is a good way to get them both.  Here are my individual ratings:<br />&quot;Brothers of Earth&quot; is Cherryh's first novel. It's an interesting book, but bears no resemblence to her later books. It's a fairly well written book that explores some interesting concepts. Unfortunately, the book doesn't really go anywhere. Specifically, the main character isn't pushing towards some kind of solution. He's essentially along for the ride. The end result is that things just happen and then the book ends. It's not a very satisfactory ending at all. If you're a die-hard Cherryh fan, I'd say you should read this book just because it's her first. It's not bad, but it's also not that good. <br />You can tell &quot;Hunter of Worlds&quot; is a very early C.J. Cherryh novel. The text is nowhere near as riveting as her later works. You can see where her later style comes from in this work, but it's really not fully present here. In general, it's an ok story. But, you never really buy into it fully. It's like you pick up in the middle of something and then put it away after something happens. You get an inkling of what the various races are like, how they behave, and what they're capable of, but it never really meshes into a consistent whole. You know that the races are different, but you really don't feel it in your bones about WHY they're different. I'm glad I read the book, but it's merely a shadow of Cherryh's later works.

I don't care what the \\"official\\" write-ups for this book say:  this is not just a book for teens.  Outside of the fact that the protagonist is a child and some of the behavior/situations are somewhat simplified, this is standard Discworld fare.  I've marked the book down from five stars to four because of this mild \\"simplification,\\" but other than that, it's wonderful.  Also, the book is much more funny than the latest Discworld novels have been.  This is an excellent book to read with good pacing, a good story, and, probably most importantly, a very satisfying ending.  Very enjoyable.  Read it.
I don't agree with the Reading Level assigned to this book (ages 9-12). Sure, 9-12 year olds could read it without problem. But, it's not a really a kid's book. It's just a very, very good book that's fun and light to read. It's also almost entirely independent of any need for prior knowledge of the Discworld. At a guess, I'd assign it a place just after \\"Moving Pictures\\" (purely based on the \\"Gaspode-the-Wonder-Dog\\" affect plus the fact that Maurice is mentioned twice in \\"Reaper Man\\" (which comes just after \\"Moving Pictures\\")). It's definitely a book to read. Anyone CAN read it and everyone SHOULD read it.

This is the 28th in Pratchett's Discworld series.  It's also one of the standalone books (\\"Equal Rites,\\" \\"Pyramids,\\" \\"Moving Pictures,\\" \\"Small Gods,\\" \\"The Truth,\\" and \\"Monstrous Regiment\\").  I'm not sure where Pratchett wanted to go with this book (or even if he knew where he wanted to go with it).  Since it was published well after 9-11, I assumed he would use it as another platform for the anti-military, anti-nationalism philosophy-apparent that he bared in \\"Jingo.\\"  Thankfully, this isn't so.  He seems to have moderated his stance there quite a bit.  Unfortunately, that left this book wandering all over the place trying to come to a satisfactory ending.  Part of the problem is that the protagonists, though fairly good, are on the wrong side:  they're part of the enemy.  You're left trying to figure out how Pratchett's going to have them succeed personally but have them lose group-wise.  What he ends up with is sort of stop-gap.  Heck, he even seems to realize this himself since at the very end everyone seems to be right back where they started (outside of the female emancipation stuff).  Also, every single character in the book (including the main one) is pretty two-dimensional.  It's like they're all putting in cameo appearances (especially the members of the Watch).  Pretty disappointing.  Overall, the book isn't bad.  But, it certainly isn't funny and it sure isn't up to his usual standards.  I rate it at a mere 3 stars out of 5.
About the best I can say for this book is that it isn't really BAD.  It starts out pretty interesting, but then its energy seems to slowly drip out of it until the ending feels like merely a dotting of &quot;i&quot;s and a crossing of &quot;t&quot;s.  Also, at about the midpoint, the book takes on a bit of a sappy tone which increases throughout the remainder of the story.  I also have problems with the amount of future slang used.  I understand that Foster is using it to set the tone, but even the main character uses it constantly:  it just gets too tiresome trying to parse it into real English so you can figure out what he's saying.  There also seems to be some kind of problem with the editor:  I counted five uses of the non-word &quot;irregardless&quot; in this book.  I can't understand how anyone who's written as much as Alan Dean Foster could use that &quot;word&quot; instead of the proper &quot;regardless.&quot;  I sure can't understand why his editors didn't catch it.  There are also several scenes where someone didn't catch contextual problems.  For instance, at one point, the protagonist has been disarmed, has escaped, and has incapacitated one of his assailants.  He then goes about his merry business without taking the captured, unconcious assailant into custody for questining and without picking up his weapon (and people are trying to kill him).  In another case, he tells someone that a certain event has happened to her father.  Suddenly, that person seems to have full knowledge of the event.  Specifically, she knows when it happened even though no one has told her that.  There are also several characters introduced into the book who don't seem to have any purpose.  They're just there for a page or two and then they're gone:  flavor, I guess.  In general, there also seem to be a lot of cases where important things happen and no one does anything to track them down and figure out why, who or how.  They're just like magical events which conviently appear topush the plot along.  If you've got some time to kill, reading this book might be worth a shot.  But, otherwise, despite it's promising beginning, it's not really worth the effort.
I really liked the concept behind this book.  But, Pullman's implementation is lacking.  First, I have problems believing that any 11-year old (even one in a fantasy novel) could or would behave as the one in this book does.  Heck, you could push her to the age of majority (18) and I still would have the same problem.  Second, the novel's world doesn't make sense.  Yes, I know it's an alternate reality.  But, the mish-mash of technologies present are silly.  For the most part, the culture seems to work on a set of technology from the 1500s to the 1800s.  But, then there are things thrown in which indicate technology from the 1900s or 2000s.  I just can't come up with a logical technology tree that would allow this to happen.  And, finally, all the characters around the protagonist are basically cardboard cutouts:  they have no depth of personality.  For instance, I still can't figure out what's motivating all these bad guys to do the horrible things they're doing to these children.  Sure, near the end, Pullman explained what they think \\"Dust\\" is.  But, I still can't see how these people made the leap from having that knowledge to, essentially, mutilating and killing children.
To say the least, I'm very upset with the other three reviews here which all gave this book a five star rating.  It's just not so.  This book is terrible.  Essentially, it's like reading a comic book.  All the characters are one-sided, extreme caricatures.  I got through about page forty (where the main &quot;characters&quot; are picking their crew) before I couldn't take it any more.  Every new &quot;character&quot; was a new oddball.  I mean, forget about these people being characters in a book.  Just think about them as forming a small crew who are going on a one-way mission in a tin can.  They'll be en-route for forty years and studying the new system for twenty more.  No organization in the universe would pick these people as crew.  They wouldn't make it to Mars orbit before they ended up killing each other.  Every member of the crew would have been psychologically screened until their brains fell out of their heads.  The people who survived that screening and were deemed capable of living in extremely close quarters with a couple of handfuls of other people for the rest of their lives would have trained together for YEARS just to make sure everything was OK.  This book is a joke as science fiction.  Either that, or it was written for the youth market.  Terrible, terrible book.  Avoid.
As of this writing, this book is the 5th in, and the end of, the Chanur series.  It's excellently written and, surprising for a Cherryh book, actually ENJOYABLE to read.  Usually, Cherryh's books are so gut-wrenchingly engrossing that you have nothing left with which to enjoy it.  This book appeals somewhat more to the intellect than to the intestines.  The tension is there, but it's far more subdued than in her other works.  One of the interesting tension-makers is how Hilfy Chanur treats the male Hani she gets stuck with.  From our Human point of view, it's really tough to understand.  However, over time, you come to understand it from a Hani (i.e. lion) perspective.  An excellent book and a suitable end/extension to the Chanur saga.
This is the fourth book in the (currently) five book Chanur series.  It's also the end of the trilogy that's left incomplete in the supposed &quot;omnibus edition&quot; &quot;The Chanur Saga.&quot;  As usual for Cherryh, this is an excellently written book that reaches down into your gut and shakes you around.  As I'm re-reading these books in quick order, I found this book to be a better read than the previous two in the trilogy.  Essentially, it's written at a more sustainable emotional pitch.  The first two books in the trilogy just never let up.  From the minute you pick them up to the minute they (don't) end, everything goes wrong and everyone's either evil, an enemy, or a fool (or some combination of the three).  This book gives you a bit of a break.  There are actually other people in it besides the protagonists who are good, competent, and/or an ally.  The pacing is also more reasonable.  You're not on the edge of your seat on every page.  The pitch actually increases fairly smoothly throughout the book.  An excellent end to the middle trilogy of the Chanur series.
This is the sequel to &quot;Chanur's Venture.&quot;  It continues where that book leaves off.  Unfortunately, like that book, this one doesn't end properly.  The ending here is slightly more reasonable than what the publisher did with &quot;Chanur's Venture,&quot; but if you read this book, you'd better have a copy of &quot;Chanur's Homecoming&quot; (the sequel) handy.  As with the prior Chanur books, this one is excellently written.  However, this one does go on a bit too much with everything possible going wrong at the worst possible time.  After about 170 pages of that in &quot;Chanur's Venture,&quot; the additional 270 pages here gets exhausting.  If the book had ended at a more reasonable point, I'd have given it four stars.
I entirely blame the publisher for the bad rating I'm giving this book.  The story and the writing are both excellent.  However, putting these three stories in one book and saying \\"Now in one magnificient omnibus edition\\" is a crime.  The first story, \\"The Pride of Chanur,\\" naturally stands alone.  It should have been left as a stand-alone book.  The other two stories, \\"Chanur's Venture\\" and \\"The Kif Strike Back,\\" should never have been sold as separate books in the first place:  each requires the other.  However, the biggest problem is that \\"The Kif Strike Back\\" requires (at least) one more book, \\"Chanur's Homecoming\\" to tie things up.  So, don't expect this \\"magnificent omnibus edition\\" to complete the story.  You'll definitely have to buy at least one other book.<br />My apologies to Cherryh on this.  Her writing is excellent.  It's just her publisher that [is bad].
And the pendulum swings.  About every 10 years, I re-read Roger Zelazny's \\"This Immortal.\\"  The last time, I felt that it hadn't weathered the intervening decades since its publication (1965) very well.  This time, I'm scratching my head wondering what I was thinking, and am revising my rating of the book to a Very Good 4 stars out of 5.  This is quintessential Zelazny:  man crossed with myth.  There's definitely a lot of 1960s (and 1970s, surprisingly) metaphysical writing going on here.  But, it works well with the story.  In fact, the prose is practically poetic.  It's very nicely described, thought-provoking, and both intellectually and emotionally satisfying.  Also, according to the Wikipedia entry for the book, \\"it tied with Frank Herbert's Dune for the 1966 Hugo Award for Best Novel.\\"  I can definitely see why.<br /><br />A note about the Kindle edition:  I bought this first Kindle version within a week of its first appearance.  Unfortunately, there are a lot of OCR-type errors strewn throughout the book.  This is a bit upsetting since the publisher is charging about $8 for a 50 year old book.  For that kind of money, I'd expect someone to have actually proof-read the conversion.  Oh, well.  I assume later editions will correct this.
This book picks up about a year after &quot;The Pride of Chanur&quot; leaves off.  From the very first moment, you're caught up in the plot and furiously trying to turn the pages faster and faster in order to see what's going to happen.  But, then, after about 170 pages of extremely well written, tightly packed, emotionally wrenching, pages, right at the very pinnacle of tension, it ENDS!  Aaaargh!  There's no excuse for this except pure greed on the part of the publisher.  This book should never have been published without its sequel, &quot;The Kif Strike Back.&quot;  I feel really bad giving such an excellent piece of work such a bad rating.  But, unless you have the sequel handy (perhaps as part of the &quot;omnibus edition&quot; &quot;The Chanur Saga&quot; (which apparently ends without ITS finish)), I can't recommend you read it.  If you've got the sequel(s), definitely read all of them.  But, don't get just this book.
I'm currently re-reading this in it's incarnation as the first part of \\"The Chanur Saga\\" \\"Omnibus edition.\\"  I wanted to put a separate review here since I intend to rate that \\"omnibus\\" low simply because it's not complete.  \\"The Pride of Chanur\\" is an excellent book.  Written in the standard Cherryh \\"from the gut\\" manner, it grabs on to your emotions and yanks them hither and yon from the first couple of pages all the way to the end.  It's one of those books where you try to read faster and faster so that you can find out what's going to happen (even after having read it several times before).  The best part of the book is the fact that it's stand-alone:  it finishes what it starts.  The remainder of the series requires this book.  But, this book doesn't require the remainder of the series (though you'll definitely want to read that).  Excellent book.
If something had actually happened, I'm sure it would have been a great book.  Well, I'm probably exaggerating a bit.  But, for the first 170 pages of this 250 page book, absolutely nothing happens.  It's essentially the background social, political, and military information of all the major players.  Around page 170 and for the next 80 pages, lots of really interesting things happen.  Unfortunately, they don't really end.  This book is merely the prologue for its sequels.  I have no problem with book trilogies.  But, there has to be SOME kind of closure in each of the books.  This book just gets going and then stops.  Highly frustrating.
This is a very good book that's right up there with Solzhenitsyn's &quot;Gulag Archipelago.&quot;  It's not exciting to read (very few histories are), but the information contained in it is vital to our understanding of the Soviet Union's past, and Russia's present and future.  This is vital to ensure that in the future, this type of thing doesn't happen again.
It must have taken me darn near a year to read all six volumes in this work.  They're inconceivably great.  They're certainly not fast reading (as evidenced by how long it took for me to complete the set), but they're truly awe inspiring.  As I read through the work, the same thing kept running through my head:  if it weren't for this man (Winston Churchill), we'd all be speaking German right now.  There's no doubt about it.  It's amazing that this set doesn't form the reading for a required course for every person in America.  I don't know about the education system in Britain, but if it's not required reading there, something has truly gone wrong with that country.  I can't stress enough how much I mean it when I say:  &quot;you MUST read these works.&quot;
I couldn't take it.  Day after day, I forced myself to read a little bit more of this book.  Day after day, it made me more and more ill.  It's hard to believe that such a good writer as Bujold could take her Vorkosigan saga and turn it into this.  For all intents and purposes, there's no plot whatsoever outside of Miles trying to woo his lady love.  Oh, sure, there's Mark having troubles with his girlfriend and with a startup business.  There's some stuff about Gregor and his wedding.  And, in the closest thing to approach anything beyond self-absorbed mush, there's some stuff involving the succession to a couple of Countships.  But, as of page 295 (out of 534), there's nothing else.  Ugh.  I'm sorry.  But, where's someone saving the world?  Or, how about saving a fleet?  Destroying an evil scourge?  Saving Miles' life?  Mark's?  Anyone's?  Nope.  Nothing.  It's all trivial stuff that's important only to the characters involved.  I'd also like to point out that almost every person in the book, though most are over 30, acts like a love-sick, idiotic teenager.  In fact, to show you how out of character everyone is, the most mature person in the book is Ivan, Miles' cousin.  It looks like this is the last of the Vorkosigan series I'll ever read.  I've read all the other books in the Vorkosigan series (and loved them all).  I've also read Bujold's books outside the series and they're pretty good. So, I guess that's where I'll look from now on.
I enjoyed reading this book.  But, I can see the writing on the wall.  It looks like from now on Bujold is going to focus more on Mile's romance and personal activities instead of on an Action and Adventure type of plot.  The Romance is well written, but I'd rather it took up 10% of the book instead of the 90% it did here.  It looks like &quot;Mirror Dance&quot; was the last &quot;true&quot; Vorkosigan book, with &quot;Memory&quot; serving as the transition, and &quot;Komarr&quot; as the first of the new style.  A shame, really.  But, still good.
When I first figured out what Miles was going to do to resolve the initial dilemma of the book, I started yelling at the book &quot;NO!  NO!  DON'T DO IT!&quot;  When he proceeded to ignore my advice, I thought the rest of the book would be a loss.  But, fortunately for all of us, Bujold worked it out properly in the end.  An absolutely wonderful book on par with &quot;Mirror Dance.&quot;  I'm not sure why Bujold felt it was time for Miles to move on.  But, she did it well.  This is the definite, no-going-back transition point.  A must read.
This is probably the best book in the whole Miles Vorkosigan series.  Interestingly, most of the book is written not from Miles' perspective, but from Mark's.  Whereas Bujold merely introduced Mark in the previous book, &quot;Brothers in Arms,&quot; in this book she fleshes him out (both literally and figuratively).  This book also sets the stage for what's coming up in the next book, &quot;Memory.&quot;  So, whatever you do, don't miss  this book.  Not only is it essential, but it's also great.
For the most part, I really enjoyed this book.  It's an excellent segment of the Vorkosigan saga and introduces Mark.  My only reason for downgrading it from a five star rating to a four star rating is that the very beginning irritates me.  Essentially, Miles is being beaten by what appears to be bureaucratic bumbling.  But, once he figures out what's really happening, things proceed nicely.  Very good book.
Normally, I dislike reading short stories: there's just no time to fully flesh out the characters. However, in this case, since these are part of the Miles Vorkosigan saga (and we're all familiar with him, his background, and his environment by now), I loved them. Each of the three short stories in the collection (\\"The Mountains of Mourning,\\" \\"Labyrinth,\\" and \\"The Borders of Infinity\\") are about 100 pages long, very interesting, and very well done. These short stories are also not peripheral to Miles' story. They seem to be covering central aspects of Miles and the Dendarii. The only downside to the book is that the three stories, though published in this one book, take place between different sets of the major books.  Specifically, the first of the short stories happens during the short gap between Miles' graduation from the Academy and his first military assignment (i.e., between [[ASIN:1886778272 The Warrior's Apprentice]] and [[ASIN:0606183833 The Vor Game]]).  While the second and third stories occur after [[ASIN:0671877445 Cetaganda]] and before [[ASIN:1416555447 Brothers in Arms]].  Nothing insurmountable, but it's disconcerting. I rate it an excellent 5 stars out of 5.
I was torn on whether I should give this book four stars or five.  I ended up going with four purely because of the extent of Miles' \\"ga-ga-ishness\\" over the haut Rian.  It's just too extreme for Miles' personality.  Other than that, I loved the book.  It fleshes out both Ivan and one of Barrayar's main rivals:  Cetaganda.  It also contains a paragraph that kicks off the \\"Terrence Cee\\" plot in Ethan of Athos.  Overall, a very good book to read.  4 stars out of 5.
About the only thing bad I can say about this book is that the pace is a bit uneven.  During the early phase of the book, while Miles is the Weather Officer on Kyril Island, things are a bit slow.  This segment of the book is necessary for future developments though, so it couldn't just have been cut.  But still, its pace is slower than that of the rest of the book.  Other than that triviality, it's really an excellent read.  I give it 5 stars out of 5.
Great book.  This is the first of the series which focuses on Miles (essentially, as he comes of age).  It's fast-paced and makes you want to read faster so you can see what's going to happen.  A definite \\"must read\\" if you're at all interested in the series.  I rate it at 5 stars out of 5.
...    Standing alone, each of the two stories in this book are very good.  Together, they're excellent.  The first book (Shards of Honor) deals strictly with the meeting and getting together of Cordelia Naismith and Aral Vorkosigan (Miles' parents).  As such, it ends right smack in the middle of the story.  The second book (Barrayar) picks up from there and continues through Miles' birth (with a bit of later stuff thrown in).  Thus, taken together, the two books in this compilation form one complete story and justify their issuance as a compilation.  This book (or its two components) are essential to the series and are wonderful to read.  Read them.
This was an enjoyable book to read.  It's nowhere near as deep as Bujold's other books, but it was still fun.  I think the people here who rated the book very low are going a bit overboard in comparing it to the rest of her works.  Standing on it's own, it's worth reading.  It's just that in comparison to the rest of the Vorkosigan books (i.e., the one's with Miles in them), this book suffers.  But, if you'd like to fill in a few hours with some light reading, go ahead and try this one.
This is one of my all-time favorite books.  I've read it at least half a dozen times and still love it.  Some of the terms I've carried throughout my life, like &quot;doodlehum&quot; and &quot;brace of roods,&quot; originate in this book.  The only problem I have with it is that it's just not long enough.  Zelazny could have easily fleshed this book out to at least twice its size.  There's nothing anyone can do about that, but it's still a fun, fast read.
This is a good, enjoyable book.  It's not riveting, or anything like that.  But, it's pleasing to read.  The only problems I have with it are minor.  First, the physical condition/ability of the main character varies drastically from page to page.  At one point, he'll be barely able to climb some stairs.  Yet, shortly thereafter he's able to win a fight.  Riding a horse practically knocks him out, yet later he can travel cross country at break-neck speed.  Disconcerting, but minor.  Second, the main female character is too sober and competent for her age.  Fairly early in the book, Bujold shows how she's still a youth and needs tempering and education.  Yet, within a year of the main character starting to teach her, she's better, smarter, faster, etc. than 99% of the people around her.  Nice, but not very realistic.  Finally, I could have done without the Spring/Autumn romance.  Still, overall the book was very enjoyable.
A terrible book. By page 94 (one third of the way through the book), the solution to the main mystery was obvious. This level of obviousness grew continuously throughout the remainder of the book until it was just plain embarassing. I spent two thirds of the book scratching my head, trying to figure out why Fletch, who is supposed to be brilliant, can't figure things out. There's no answer to this. Also, the ending tied to the secondary mystery is horrible. Unfortunately, there's not much I can say about it without giving it away. It's just all-around terrible and depressing. Stay away from this book.
Well, I'm glad I read this book after giving up on &quot;Carioca Fletch&quot; (hint:  stay away from that book).  This is a very good book that grabs your attention and keeps it all the way through.  The one thing I didn't like about the book (and it might just be a function of the genre and not a fault specific to the book) is that the &quot;solution&quot; to the mystery is not one that you really have any stake in finding.  Essentially, you're hit with more information at the very end of the book which gives you a surprise ending.  That aside, it's still a very good, fun book that's well worth reading.
I enjoyed reading this book.  I picked it up because Flynn was the Boston Inspector Fletch worked with/against in &quot;Confess, Fletch&quot; (a very good book).  The book is a fun, engrossing read.  But, the ending is a bit weak.  Oh, the bad guys are found out, but there's no satisfaction in it.  Various third parties clean things up once Flynn figures things out, but Flynn doesn't really get to say &quot;I told you so&quot; or to rub someone's nose in their stupidity.  Truth, Justice, and the American Way are served, but it's an intellectual service, not a visceral one.  Nevertheless, it's still a good book to read.
Essentially, this is a standard, politically correct tract that says the US, corporations, the military, and, apparently, most whites are ... and that if we all get together we'll teach the world to sing and live in perfect harmony.  In other words, it's tripe.  The premise is silly and the way they go about trying to implement the premise is jaw-droppingly stupid.  Adding insult to the injury of a bad plot is the bad writing.  The frequent switching from first person to third person is the big thing there that kept grabbing my attention.  Every time it happened, I'd back up through the pages to see if there was some reason for it.  There never was.<br />Don't bother reading this book.  It's not worth the effort.
This is my first Fletch book, and it might be my last.  I'm only half way through it, but I'm not even sure I'll finish it.  Essentially, the problem boils down to there not being any Fletch in the book.  Though he's physically present, he doesn't seem to do, say, or think anything.  Most of the book consists of McDonald going on and on and on about Brazil and the Brazilians.  Fletch just sits in the middle of it and observses their zany, wackiness (as if anyone cares).  Theoretically, there's a murder mystery here, but no one, especially not Fletch, does anything to investigate.  Looking at the other reviews here, it appears it's not just me who thinks this.  So, I'd say don't bother reading this.
I really enjoyed this book.  It's a Science Fiction Detective novel centered around the detective, his evil genius nemesis, and, for spice, an evil genius mad scientist, each in plural.  Cool.I do agree with others, though, that the ending could have been better.  First, at about 150 pages short of the end, it seems like everything's ready to be tied up.  Brin uses those extra 150 pages to escalate the evil scheme from the personal through the corporate to all humanity.  By the time you get to the actual end, you understand that.  But still, it FEELS like the book should have ended 150 pages earlier.  Also, those last 150 pages do tend to get bogged down in a lot of metaphysics.  Those are interesting, but they could have been condensed somewhat.  The very last action of the book is a bit of a letdown, though.Even though the ending could have been better, this is still a very good book to read.
I agree wholeheartedly with the review here by Phil Thwing.  Essentially, the book starts out in classic Zelaznyish fashion but suddenly shifts over to something else about half way through.  Very disappointing.  The first half is full of depth and then the second half turns shallow.  About the only good thing you can say about the ending is that it seems to tie up all the threads.  But, there's no satisfaction to it.  I wish people would stop trying top publish a dead man's unfinished works.  It just degrades his real legacy.
I loved the Night's Dawn and Mandel series and, so, was doubly disappointed with this book.  My first disappointment was when I figured out that this book had nothing to do with those books' universe.  But, the biggest problem with the book is that it reads a lot like some kind of dissertation on various political, economic, and social structures.  The various characters will be running around killing each other and destroying each other's assets and, the next thing you know, they're standing around discussing how their society is organized and the benefits/disadvantages of that.  And those discussions go on for a LOT of pages.<br />The next biggest problem with the book is that there are really no \\"good guys.\\"  The main character, though he seems to be a nice, intelligent, educated, moral, caring person, is, for all intents and purposes, a pirate.  All the space-faring corporations of Earth practice piracy as a standard business practice.  Maybe Hamilton was trying for a \\"Dread Pirate Roberts\\" (The Princess Bride) or Frederick (Pirates of Penzance), but that's not what comes across.  Instead, you left scratching your head wondering who you're supposed to be rooting for and what that apparent person is doing working for the people he does (regardless of his dreams).<br />And then, there's the ending.  For the first 600 pages, the book is hard Science Fiction.  Then, out of the blue, comes what is essentially a fairytale.  To explain what has been happening, Hamilton essentially waves his arms about and says \\"and then a miracle occurs.\\"  Extremely jarring and very disappointing.<br />I've also got problems with the amount of sex in the book.  Hamilton appears to have gone out of his way to introduce and develop characters just so his main character can have sex with them (oh, and discuss various wacko social, economic, and political theories -- for chapters on end).  Since this book is FAR too long, Hamilton could have made it at least readable by pulling all the social dissertations, sex, fairy tales, and extraneous characters out.  That would have left him with a couple of hundred pages to try to align his main character's personality with his actions.
The book's tolerable.  Essentially, the problem with it boils down to shallowness:  the characters are merely caricatures, the dialog is banal, and the plot has no depth.  If I had actually bought this book instead of borrowing it from the library, I'd probably be more upset about it.  As it is, it was just a waste of time reading it.  I find this amazing since all the other Ender/Bean books of this era are excellent.  I don't know what happened with this book, but don't bother reading it.
This is the 27th book in Pratchett's Discworld series.  Alternatively, it's the 6th book in the Watch subseries (\\"Guards! Guards,\\" \\"Men at Arms,\\" \\"Feet of Clay,\\" \\"Jingo,\\" \\"The Fifth Elephant,\\" \\"Night Watch,\\" and \\"Thud!\\").  It's a masterpiece, but, unfortunately, if you haven't read all the earlier Watch books (and, possibly, \\"Thief of Time\\"), the book will mean nothing to you.  Also, it's not a hilariously funny book (though it is funny in a darker way).  It extends the trend toward seriousness present in his other books of the Watch.  I think what Pratchett's done in this book is where he'll be going for future books:  he'll fill in the far past of his characters.  The humor will be there for other characters (like the Witches or the Wizards), but for the Watch, I think he'll maintain a more serious, darker, police-work feel with dabs of humor here and there.  Really, an excellent book that requires the background of his previous works.  I rate it at 5 stars out of 5.
This book is the very epitome of FRUSTRATION.  To paraphrase from the movie \\"Mozart:\\"  \\"too many words.\\"  If it hadn't been for Willis' excellent writing technique, I'd have given this book no more than two stars.  The theme is interesting, but the plot consists of two \\"steps forward, one step back,\\" repeated and repeated and repeated for 500 pages.  Then just when it looks like everything's going to come together, disaster strikes.  Willis then spends the next 250 pages REPEATING the same process (over and over and over again) to get to the same place.  This time, though, it's slightly quicker:  \\"THREE steps forward, one step back.\\"<br />In general, Willis obviously spends a ton of time researching her books before she writes them.  But, her writing motif seems to always be that ... (I happen to agree, so I really get sucked into her plots :) ).  No more than three people in the whole universe are helpful and everyone else actively frustrates the competent people from doing the right thing.  That's fine and dandy, but there's a limit to how much of that anyone can take.  I heartily enjoyed both \\"To Say Nothing of the Dog\\" and \\"Bellwether,\\" but \\"Doomsday Book\\" and now \\"Passage\\" just go too far (again, \\"too many words\\").<br />If you haven't read any Willis in a while, then this book is definitely fascinating.  But, if you've been reading her books sequentially, I'd suggest taking a break for a bit.  Technically excellent, thematically interesting, but plotwise:  FRUSTRATING.
This is the 25th of Pratchett's Discworld series.  Since the main characters aren't really used ever again, it's also one of the standalone books in the series (\\"Equal Rites,\\" \\"Pyramids,\\" \\"Moving Pictures,\\" \\"Small Gods,\\" \\"The Truth,\\" and \\"Monstrous Regiment\\").  It's an OK book written in good Pratchett style, but it just seems to be missing something.  I think the problem is that Pratchett took what should have been the main story (Vetinari and his troubles) and made it a secondary story in support of his new characters and their printing press.  Really, the main action SHOULD have been done by the Watch (i.e., we should have been reading this from Vimes' point of view and seeing the rise of the press secondarily).  But, alas, in this book all the members of the Watch have mere cameo appearances.  The theme, plot and humor all seem to be pretty good.  But, overall, it just doesn't click.  The book's not bad.  But, it's not great either.  I rate it at a decent 3 stars out of 5.
I'm torn about Connie Willis' &#34;[[ASIN:B004G60FXG The Doomsday Book]].&#34;  On the one hand, she obviously did a ton of research into the time period an has produced a really interesting universe with a riveting plot.  On the other hand, she tried to cram too much of her research into this book and it ended up getting in the way of the plot.  Also, her characterizations need work.  She's got two or three nicely fleshed out characters.  But, everyone else is nothing but a caricature:  she chooses one trait per character and exaggerates it past the point of belief.  In her &#34;[[ASIN:B00309SCOE To Say Nothing of the Dog]],&#34; her characters exhibit a bit of the same trait.  But, that book is much lighter than this one, and the characterizations just make for a nicer story.  This story is already dark and dreary, and her caricatures just add sand to the gears.  I'll also add that in the book's &#34;present,&#34; there's really no emotional satisfaction with how things get resolved.  Essentially, something happens that allows one of the protagonists to do what he's been trying to do for the last 400 pages or so.  Then, in the book's &#34;past,&#34; you're pretty darn sure what's going to happen, but it takes forever to get there.  Once it happens, she spends far too much time getting to the point where everything comes together.  But, I think the biggest disappointment was that she ends the book too early (yes, I know that seems to contradict my &#34;long and drawn out&#34; comment).  I can't say too much here, but just a few more footsteps and a couple of conversations to bring everyone up-to-date would have given the ending a better feel.  For the most part, I enjoyed the book.  But, the best I can rate it is an OK 3 stars out of 5.
This is the 26th of Pratchett's Discworld series.  Alternatively, you could consider it to be the 5th in the Death/Mort/Susan subseries (\\"Mort,\\" \\"Reaper Man,\\" \\"Soul Music,\\" \\"Hogfather,\\" and \\"Thief of Time\\").  I say this because Susan and Death play a very large part in the book (say, 40% of the plot).  However, the real players are Lu-Tze (seen once before in \\"Small Gods\\" (which is a fairly important book in the series, though I didn't care for it)) and his apprentice Lobsang Ludd.  This book seems to be Pratchett's attempt to have some fun with the quantum nature of space and time.  But, the best part of the book is simply Pratchett's genius at using cultural metaphors and other things we take for granted for humor and wit.    This is a wonderful book and I highly recommend it.    In my original review, I rated this book at 4 stars out of 5.  After re-reading the book, I'd like to upgrade my rating to 5 stars out of 5.  Unfortunately, I can't edit the actual rating that shows up here.
This is the 24th of Pratchett's Discworld series.  Alternatively, it's the 5th book in the Watch subseries (\\"Guards! Guards,\\" \\"Men at Arms,\\" \\"Feet of Clay,\\" \\"Jingo,\\" \\"The Fifth Elephant,\\" \\"Night Watch,\\" and \\"Thud!\\").  In this one, Pratchett uproots the Watch and has it visit Uberwald.  While there, Mr. Vimes meets and old friend of the Patrician and the family of Angua.  Like most of the other Watch books, this one's far more \\"serious\\" and deeper than standard Discword fare.  It reads more like a romantic adventure mystery than a comedy and has a very emotionally satisfying ending.  An excellent book:  5 stars out of 5.
This is the 23rd of Pratchett's Discworld series.  Alternatively, it's the 5th book in the Witches subseries (\\"Wyrd Sisters,\\" \\"Witches Abroad,\\" \\"Lords and Ladies,\\" \\"Maskerade,\\" and \\"Carpe Jugulum\\").  In this book, Pratchett's managed to re-\\"star\\" Magrat as a member of a separate, overlapping threesome of witches all while keeping her as a queen.  He also does some good development of Agnes Nitt and has provided a clever way of, possibly, strengthening or hardening her a bit.  The book's not as funny as others (the storyline is quite dark), but Shakespeare would have labeled this a Comedy.  Excellent book.  I rate it at 5 stars out of 5.
This is the 22nd of Pratchett's Discworld series.  Alternatively, it's the 6th in the Rincewind subseries (\\"The Color of Magic,\\" \\"The Light Fantastic,\\" \\"Sourcery,\\" \\"Eric,\\" \\"Interesting Times,\\" and \\"The Last Continent\\").  As is always the case, the book is a lot of fun to read.  Unfortunately, the storyline is a bit shallow.  Essentially, there's very little development of a plot.  In the major storyline, Rincewind is supposed to do something to save XXXX.  But, there's really no progress towards it through 99% of the book (besides the obvious progress of putting one foot in front of the other).  Basically, the major plotline of the book consists of Rincewind running through various unrelated aspects of Australia, and then getting drunk and fixing everything.  The secondary storyline is not much better.  Reading about the wizards bickering amongst themselves is fun, but after a while you notice that that's ALL it is.  Nothing really happens, and they sure don't solve anything themselves.  They're essentially a mechanism to introduce a twist in the Rincewind line.  For light entertainment, the book is fine.  But, for an engrossing plot, it's not really worth it.  I rate the book as merely an OK 3 stars out of 5.
This is the 21st of Pratchett's Discworld series.  Alternatively, it's the 4th book in the Watch subseries (\\"Guards! Guards,\\" \\"Men at Arms,\\" \\"Feet of Clay,\\" \\"Jingo,\\" \\"The Fifth Elephant,\\" \\"Night Watch,\\" and \\"Thud!\\").  Like all his books, this one has a very lively, funny, and tongue-in-cheek plot and narrative.  Unfortunately, the very theme of the book forces me to downgrade it to only 3 stars.  The title of the book tells it all:  Jingo.  According to Webster, that's \\"a person who boasts of his patriotism and favors an aggressive, threatening, warlike foreign policy; chauvinist....\\"  Essentially, this is an anti-military, anti-nationalism book.  It's an interesting thing that throughout Pratchett's novels, various groups of people have formed into guilds.  Assassins, thieves, beggers, prostitutes (heck, even stray dogs), etc. all have guilds and, in general, the membership of those guilds are very competent at what they do.  Indeed, not only are these people competent, but the very existence of those guilds is considered to be a GOOD thing (in an Ankh-Morporkian way).  However, there's no military guild.  Almost every instance of military thought or use in this book is something held up as a matter of ridicule.  There are no competent military men (well, perhaps one Lieutenant).  And the military is always considered to be a BAD thing.  Ditto for nationalism.  This is a very strange mindset that almost ruins the book.  If you subscribe to the same mindset, or if you can work around it for a bit, this is a very good book.  But, unfortunately, I found it disconcerting (to say the least).  I rate it at merely an OK 3 stars out of 5.
This is the 20th in Pratchett's Discworld series.  In general, it's a book about Death.  But, more correctly, it's a book centering on Susan.  Specifically, it's the 4th in the Death/Mort/Susan subseries (\\"Mort,\\" \\"Reaper Man,\\" \\"Soul Music,\\" \\"Hogfather,\\" and \\"Thief of Time\\").  As in \\"Soul Music,\\" Susan is once again \\"teamed\\" with the Death of Rats and the raven to solve a problem while Death is busy elsewhere (though for a very different reason this time).  Along with the main plot, Pratchett also does a good bit of development on the Unseen University's Hex.  The wizards, too, get a big slice of the book as a \\"comedy relief\\" for Susan's \\"serious\\" outlook on life.  One detail that bothered me, though, was that at the end of \\"Soul Music,\\" Susan was supposedly getting together with Buddy.  He's entirely missing from this book (not just missing -- it's like he never existed at all).  But, other than that, a very good book with a very interesting plot and a lot of funny moments.  I rate it at 4 stars out of 5.
This is the 19th of Pratchett's Discworld series.  Alternatively, it's the 4th book in the Witches subseries (\\"Wyrd Sisters,\\" \\"Witches Abroad,\\" \\"Lords and Ladies,\\" \\"Maskerade,\\" and \\"Carpe Jugulum\\").  In this book, Pratchett uses the \\"Phantom of the Opera\\" as the basis for his plot.  The main character (outside of Granny Weatherwax and Nanny Ogg) is Agnes (Perdita X.) Nitt, who had a cameo role in \\"Lords and Ladies.\\"  With a lot of adventure, murder, mystery, and comedy, Pratchett manages to set her up as a replacement for Magrat in the coven.  An amusing sub-plot is how Nanny manipulates Granny (whom she's worried about) into the main plot.  Though it works, this, not surprisingly, fairly quickly boomerangs on her.  This book has oodles of those passages where you burst out laughing while reading and just have to tell your spousal unit while she's busy trying to do something else.  An essential, excellent book.  Read it:  5 stars out of 5.
This is the 18th of Pratchett's Discworld series.  Alternatively, it's the 5th in the Rincewind subseries (\\"The Color of Magic,\\" \\"The Light Fantastic,\\" \\"Sourcery,\\" \\"Eric,\\" \\"Interesting Times,\\" and \\"The Last Continent\\").  It once again brings back Rincewind and re-unites him with Cohen and Twoflower (though Twoflower's role is practically a cameo).  Pratchett does an excellent job of intertwining the two multiply-intersecting storylines centering around Cohen and Rincewind.  The recurring motifs of potatoes (I almost died while Rincewind was on his desert isle and thought some beautiful women were offering him potatoes) and \\"Aaargh\\" were hilarious, so pay attention when they're introduced.  The book fleshes out Cohen's character a bit more and does some more development of the Unseen University's \\"Hex.\\"  Very good book.  I rate it at 4 stars out of 5.
This is the 17th in Pratchett's Discworld series.  Alternatively, it's the 3rd book in the Watch subseries (&#34;Guards! Guards,&#34; &#34;Men at Arms,&#34; &#34;Feet of Clay,&#34; &#34;Jingo,&#34; &#34;The Fifth Elephant,&#34; &#34;Night Watch,&#34; and &#34;Thud!&#34;).  In this book, Pratchett uses the continuing development of the Watch to produce more of a Mystery novel than usual (and poke fun at the genre at the same time).  In the process, he introduces a new race of creatures, gives Carrot girl problems, increases the visibility of Nobby, and starts a bit of an upheaval in Dwarf circles with Corporal Littlebottom.  An excellent book:  5 stars out of 5.
This is the 16th in Pratchett's Discworld series.  Alternatively, it's the 3rd in the Death/Mort/Susan subseries (\\"Mort,\\" \\"Reaper Man,\\" \\"Soul Music,\\" \\"Hogfather,\\" and \\"Thief of Time\\"). I'm torn between giving it a four or a five star rating.  I really enjoyed the book and there are a lot of really funny things that make you laugh out loud when you read it.  But, something seems to be missing.  The best I can come up with is the lack of some character development and a minor quibble with a motive.  For character development, I think Pratchett could have done some more with both Susan and with \\"Buddy.\\"  Susan doesn't seem to grow much with the plot.  She starts out one way and essentially ends up the same way.  \\"Buddy,\\" on the other hand, gets hardly any character development at all.  Even though he's one of the main characters, he's pretty much of a blank throughout the book.  My quibble with a motive is that the reason Death is trying to forget isn't clearly explained.  I'm 99% certain it has to do with a couple of deaths he had to oversee, but he keeps talking about bony knees (which would apply to someone else).  Other than that, this is a very good book with a lot of good humor.
This is the 15th in Pratchett's Discworld series.  Alternatively, it's the 2nd book in the Watch subseries (\\"Guards! Guards,\\" \\"Men at Arms,\\" \\"Feet of Clay,\\" \\"Jingo,\\" \\"The Fifth Elephant,\\" \\"Night Watch,\\" and \\"Thud!\\").  In this book, Pratchett does a multi-cultural transformation of the Watch, transitions Vimes from a Captain to a Mr., and, one way or another, brings Carrot into his own.  The book also introduces Angua and \\"fleshes out\\" (as it were) Detritus a bit more.  The book is so good that I kept trying to read it faster and faster just so I could see what was going to happen next (and I've read the book several times now :) ).  Excellent book and an essential one to the series.  5 stars out of 5.
This is the 14th of Pratchett's Discworld series.  Alternatively, it's the 3rd book in the Witches subseries (\\"Wyrd Sisters,\\" \\"Witches Abroad,\\" \\"Lords and Ladies,\\" \\"Maskerade,\\" and \\"Carpe Jugulum\\").  It picks up practically where the last Witches book (\\"Witches Abroad\\") left off (arriving back from their trip abroad).  This book is based on Shakespeare's \\"A Midsummer Night's Dream.\\"  What's nice about this book is the linkage between the Witches and the Wizards.  Along with Granny, Nanny, and Magrat, a good part of the book is based on Arch-Chancellor Ridcully's and Granny's youth.  There's also some work with the Librarian, Ponder Stibbons and the-now-medicated Bursar.  Also, this is Magrat's swan song.  The book's not quite as good as \\"Witches Abroad,\\" but I still had tears in my eyes from laughing so much.  Excellent book:  5 stars out of 5.
This is the 12th of Pratchett's Discworld series.  Alternatively, it's the 2nd book in the Witches subseries (\\"Wyrd Sisters,\\" \\"Witches Abroad,\\" \\"Lords and Ladies,\\" \\"Maskerade,\\" and \\"Carpe Jugulum\\").  It's one of the very best (at least on par with \\"Reaper Man,\\" and maybe even a tad bit better).  Obviously, this book centers around Granny Weatherwax, Nanny Ogg, and Magrat Garlick.  Pratchett uses the actual concept of fairy tales as his template.  His main fairy tale is Cinderella.  But, he brings many others in:  \\"Snow White,\\" \\"The Three Little Pigs,\\" \\"Little Red Riding Hood.\\"  He's even got references to \\"The Hobbit\\" and \\"The Wizard of Oz.\\"  As always, the interesting relationship between Granny and Nanny is hilarious.  As an added bonus, in this book, Pratchett's given quite a bit of emphasis to Grebo (Nanny's cat (who deserves a book all of his own)).  This is a must-read book, especially if you're a fan of Granny, Nanny, and Magrat:  5 stars out of 5.
This is the 13th in Pratchett's Discworld series.  It's also, technically, a stand-alone book (like \\"Equal Rites,\\" \\"Pyramids,\\" \\"Moving Pictures,\\" \\"Small Gods,\\" \\"The Truth,\\" and \\"Monstrous Regiment\\").  The main character doesn't show up anywhere else in the series, but a secondary character, Lu-Tze, does.  Also, the main thrust of the plot is fairly important in a few later books.  You could probably pick this book up without having read any other Pratchett.  But, I wouldn't recommend skipping it (regardless of my mere 3 star rating).    Normally, I love anything by Pratchett.  But, this book's a poser.  It's VERY well written in good Pratchett style.  It has a good plot, good theme, and a few nice twists and turns.  My problem with the book is that it's not \\"nice.\\"  In fact, it's depressing.  The prevalence of rot and evil that the main character has to fight makes my stomache churn.  I read Pratchett to lighten my life.  This book doesn't do that.  Technically, it's a VERY good book.  I just don't like the subject material.  Splitting the difference, I can only give it a rating of 3 stars out of 5.
This is the second Connie Willis book I've read (the first being &quot;To Say Nothing of the Dog&quot;).  Like that other book, this is just amazing.  Essentially, the book is a mixture of Dilbert-on-steroids, science, history, history of science, humor, and romance.  Also like that other book, this one has an underlying theme of the importance of coincidence in our world.  Excellent book.  Definitely read it.
I don't agree with the Reading Level assigned to this book (ages 9-12). Sure, 9-12 year olds could read it without problem. But, it's not a really a kid's book. It's just a very, very good book that's fun and light to read. It's also almost entirely independent of any need for prior knowledge of the Discworld. At a guess, I'd assign it a place just after \\"Moving Pictures\\" (purely based on the \\"Gaspode-the-Wonder-Dog\\" affect plus the fact that Maurice is mentioned twice in \\"Reaper Man\\" (which comes just after \\"Moving Pictures\\")). It's definitely a book to read. Anyone CAN read it and everyone SHOULD read it.
An amazing book.  Essentially, it can be summed up with:  &quot;The best-laid schemes o' mice an 'men. Gang aft agley.&quot;  From the second you pick it up, you're caught up in it just as though you were the protagonist.  Action.  Mystery.  Romance.  Time-travel.  Even bits of History and Culture.  All of it set in a book you just can't put down.  I don't know why I'd never run across Connie Willis' books before, but I'm going to get her others now.  Amazing book.
This is the 10th in Pratchett's Discworld.  Since neither of the main characters (Victor and Theda (\\"Ginger\\")) are ever referenced in any other Discworld books, this is one of the \\"standalone\\" books in the series (\\"Equal Rites,\\" \\"Pyramids,\\" \\"Moving Pictures,\\" \\"Small Gods,\\" \\"The Truth,\\" and \\"Monstrous Regiment\\").  It's also one of the excellent ones.  As the name implies, it's a parody of Hollywood during its Golden Age.  Since Pratchett's forte is working with cultural metaphors, and Hollywood is a prime source of such metaphors, Pratchett is at his best here.  The way the material and various films tie together (especially in the last 100 pages or so) is hilarious.  Plus, the book does some good development of C.M.O.T. Dibbler and Detritus.  It also introduces Ridcully, the Archancellor who seems to be Pratchett's now-permanent one, and one of my favorite recurring characters:  Gaspode.  Excellent book.  I rate it at 5 stars out of 5.
This is the 9th in Pratchett's Discworld series.  Alternatively, it's the 4th in the Rincewind subseries (\\"The Color of Magic,\\" \\"The Light Fantastic,\\" \\"Sourcery,\\" \\"Eric,\\" \\"Interesting Times,\\" and \\"The Last Continent\\").  The book is merely OK.  It's a fun, short read, but has a very shallow, linear plot.  Its sole purpose is to be a vehicle for the return of Rincewind.  There's nothing wrong with that, per se, but it's just too short to have any depth.  The version I have is 197 pages long, whereas these books normally run around 250 pages long.  That doesn't sound too bad until you look at some of the typographic tricks the publisher uses to stretch the apparent size of the book:  they use a bigger type face than normal, use one-and-one-half line spacing instead of single-spacing, and then increase the margin sizes.  All in all, I'd estimate this book to be equivalent to about 100 pages:  merely a short-story -- a novella at best.    Mostly because of its length (or lack thereof), I give this book a merely OK 3 stars out of 5.  If you skipped it entirely, you'd really miss nothing of the series except the actual mechanism of how Rincewind gets back.
This is the 7th in Pratchett's Discworld series.  Essentially, it stands on its own (like \\"Equal Rites,\\" \\"Pyramids,\\" \\"Moving Pictures,\\" \\"Small Gods,\\" \\"The Truth,\\" and \\"Monstrous Regiment\\").  Outside of a general knowledge of the Discworld, you don't need to have read any of the earlier books and, since none of the characters or events are ever referenced in any other Discworld books, you won't miss anything if you skip it.  However, since it's such a good book, I wouldn't recommend that.  It's not one of the greats of the Discworld series.  But, it's still very enjoyable and entertaining to read.  I rate it at 4 stars out of 5.
As I write this review, this book is showing an average rating of 4 stars.  I have no idea how that can be.  The premise is interesting:  a SciFi interpretation of the creation of Heaven and Earth and the Fall.  But, you can just feel the author trying to cram the plot in to fit the established framework.  There's also almost nothing in the book which talks about WHY the characters are acting as they do.  Mostly, it's about WHAT they do and isn't it clever how it meshes with the accepted interpretation.  Since most of what the characters are doing is pretty sophomoric, having a better idea of their motivations is essential.  Some of the anthropomorphisms are absurd, too (i.e., assuming pre-Earth angels would act as we do, make things of steel, and light their homes with torches is ridiculous).    Since I rate this book at a mere 2 stars out of 5, I'd say that if you want to read it, get it from the library and save yourself a bundle.
This is the first in Pratchett's Discworld series (one of the best series of books ever written).  As such, it's an absolute MUST READ for everyone.  Unfortunately, the book isn't one of the excellent ones in the series.  It's nowhere near being a bad book.  It's just not an excellent one.  It's OK.  Along with being the first in the whole series, this book is also the first in the Rincewind subseries (&#34;The Color of Magic,&#34; &#34;The Light Fantastic,&#34; &#34;Sourcery,&#34; &#34;Eric,&#34; &#34;Interesting Times,&#34; and &#34;The Last Continent&#34;).  Since Rincewind and the Luggage are recurring motifs in the series, you definitely have to read this.  I rate this book at an OK 3 stars out of 5 (the series, as a whole, would get 5 out of 5).
This is the 2nd book in Pratchett's Discworld.  Alternatively, it's also the 2nd in the Rincewind subseries (\\"The Color of Magic,\\" \\"The Light Fantastic,\\" \\"Sourcery,\\" \\"Eric,\\" \\"Interesting Times,\\" and \\"The Last Continent\\").  It picks up immediately after the \\"cliff-hanger\\" of \\"The Color of Magic,\\" but is a far better book (it's a coherent whole instead of several short bits strung together).  It's extremely interesting to read this book after having read the entire series (several times), since you notice all the little embryonic ideas Pratchett has for development in later books.  Also, you can see how his concept of the Discworld changes over time.  I rate this book at 4 stars out of 5.
This is the 8th in Pratchett's Discworld.  Alternatively, it's the 1st book in the Watch subseries (\\"Guards! Guards,\\" \\"Men at Arms,\\" \\"Feet of Clay,\\" \\"Jingo,\\" \\"The Fifth Elephant,\\" \\"Night Watch,\\" and \\"Thud!\\").  An excellent book which introduces the Watch (specifically, and most importantly, Carrot and Vimes).  It also fleshes out both the Librarian and the Patrician some more.  All of these become very important in later books, so reading this one is not only great fun, it's also essential to the series.  I rate it at 5 stars out of 5.
This is Pratchett's 5th in the Discworld series.  Alternatively, it's the 3rd in the Rincewind subseries (\\"The Color of Magic,\\" \\"The Light Fantastic,\\" \\"Sourcery,\\" \\"Eric,\\" \\"Interesting Times,\\" and \\"The Last Continent\\").  I'd say that this book, along with \\"Interesting Times,\\" are the best of the Rincewind set.  A couple of disconcerting things about the book are that 1) even though the prequel, \\"The Light Fantastic\\" has Rincewind saving the Discworld, this book starts off with no reference to it (and with a severe, though not unexpected, lowering of what Rincewind's status should be), and 2) the book doesn't end all that pleasantly for Rincewind and the Luggage.  Even so, this is a very good book that I rate at 4 stars out of 5.
\\"Mort\\" is the 4th Discworld novel.  Alternatively, it's the 1st in the Death/Mort/Susan subseries (\\"Mort,\\" \\"Reaper Man,\\" \\"Soul Music,\\" \\"Hogfather,\\" and \\"Thief of Time\\").  It's also the best of the series up to that point.  An excellent book with some of the best writing I've ever read.  In this book, Pratchett develops Death and transforms him from a flat, cameo-like persona to a recurring, fairly central, far-more-LIFE-like role.  Wonderful book.
This is a tough book to review.  It's a consolidation of the two separate Amber series (call them the Corwin series and the Merlin series).  As a consolidation, it's a wonderful thing to have.  I much prefer having the one big book to having 10 different books that I have to keep in order.  The tough part of this review is that I absolutely love the Corwin series.  I first read it decades ago.  Loved it then, and love it now.  The problem is that the end is not satisfactory.  When the Merlin series came out, I had hoped that it would fix that ending.  To some small extent, it does.  But mostly, it goes about its own business.  Plus, it doesn't even end its own side nicely.  I rate the Merlin series as only OK (say, three stars).  Thus, my overall four star rating.  The Corwin series is an absolute must read.  A Classic.  Even though the Merlin series is not as good, the overall compilation is something everyone should have.
This is the first of a train of excellent books (In Conquest Born, The Madness Season, Black Sun Rising, When True Night Falls, and Crown of Shadows) by C. S. Friedman.  All of these books are very different from each other.  This is pure science fiction, The Madness Season is mostly science fiction with generous doses of several other genres, and the Coldfire Trilogy is mostly fantasy with a smattering of science fiction.  All excellent.  This book can probably be best summarized by a passage on page 276:<br />&quot;The ancient Braxana would have valued such an enmity.  They had created elaborate rituals to formalize the confrontation of equals, in order to increase its destructive/constructive power.  Such rituals hadn't been used in centuries, perhaps millennia.  No k'airth had existed since the Braxana warriors left their native steppes and were absorbed by civilization; in the complexity of modern society, paired enmity had ceased to be valued.  Until now.&quot;
How to describe this book?  Perhaps as Sci-Fi?  How about Occult?  Aliens take over the world?  Psychological exploration?  Romance?  All of those (and more) apply.  This is a wonderful book that has you *scratching* your head trying to figure out what's going on for the first 75 pages and then has you *slapping* your head over the feeling that you should have known. And from there, it keeps on getting better.  One of my favorite books.
This ending has a lot of unexpected twists.  It's not just a linear &quot;solution&quot; to the problem set up in the previous books.  From the first chapter on, we're presented with whole new twists which tie together very nicely to provide something totally new from the ending.  As a hint, one of those twists has a lot in common with the standard, &quot;surprise&quot; at the end of the old Might &amp; Magic games.  An excellent ending to an excellent trilogy.
Like the first book of this series, this is about good vs evil with the two bound together for their own reasons.  The conflict engendered by this is extremely interesting.  The only reason I gave this four stars instead of five, was that I think it runs a tad long.  This is the third time I've read the book, so maybe I'm just getting overly familiar with it.  But, I'd say a lot of the &quot;wandering in the wilderness&quot; parts of it could be trimmed a bit.  Other than that, great.
This excellent book is the first of a trilogy.  It's the start of a good vs evil tale.  But, in this case, not only is good pitted against evil, it's also bound to evil.  Both are trying to accomplish their own goals:  one for love, the other for survival.  By the end of the book, this morphs into something much bigger (which is taken up by the second in the series).  Excellent book.
John Varley's \\"The Golden Globe\\" isn't exactly a sequel to \\"Steel Beach.\\" It's sort of a follow on. Part of it takes place before and during the time of \\"Steel Beach,\\" while most of it takes place afterwards. The vast majority of the book happens elsewhere, though. With that out of the way, it's still a good book. I think I prefer \\"Steel Beach\\" to it.  But, it's a close call. \\"The Golden Globe\\" revolves far less around sex and the decadence of the society and more around one person and his flight from his own life. It's a big book and isn't exactly an easy read. But, still, it's worth the time.  I rate it at a Very Good 4 stars out of 5.<br /><br />The novels in John Varley's \\"Eight Worlds\\" universe are:<br /><br />1.  [[ASIN:B00AFXMAC8 The Ophiuchi Hotline]]<br />2.  [[ASIN:0441785654 Steel Beach]]<br />3.  [[ASIN:B00AFVTSGG The Golden Globe]]
This is the 3rd in Pratchett's Discworld series.  First off, after having read through the whole series several times now (this time sorted by the main characters instead of chronologically), I definitely have to raise my rating of this book from 3 stars to 4 stars out of 5.  Secondly, classifying this book by main character is a bit of a poser.  You could make a case for it being the 1st book in the Witches subseries (\\"Wyrd Sisters,\\" \\"Witches Abroad,\\" \\"Lords and Ladies,\\" \\"Maskerade,\\" and \\"Carpe Jugulum\\") since it introduces Granny Weatherwax.  But, since most of it is really written from the viewpoint of Eskarina and Granny really isn't as magnificently deep as she will become in later books, I'll have to keep this book as one of the standalone books (\\"Equal Rites,\\" \\"Pyramids,\\" \\"Moving Pictures,\\" \\"Small Gods,\\" \\"The Truth,\\" and \\"Monstrous Regiment\\").  This is especially true since Eskarina is never seen, heard, nor referenced in any later books.  Also, in my previous version of this review, I wrote that you really wouldn't miss anything by skipping over the book.  Once again, I find that I was wrong.  With this reading, I've noticed that there are an awful lot of central, recurring Discworld (and particularly \\"The Witches\\") themes that happen in this book first.  So, I'll have to say that \\"Equal Rites\\" is an essential book to the series and is very good, to boot:  4 stars out of 5.
This is the 6th book in Pratchett's Discworld series.  Alternatively, it's the 1st book in the Witches subseries (\\"Wyrd Sisters,\\" \\"Witches Abroad,\\" \\"Lords and Ladies,\\" \\"Maskerade,\\" and \\"Carpe Jugulum\\" -- though Granny Weatherwax did have a role in \\"Equal Rites\\" (which preceded this)).  Take the essence of Macbeth, give it a twist, sprinkle it with hilarious characters, dialog, and situations, and then throw in several parallel structures.  Shake well.  You've got one of the best books ever written by anyone, anywhere (this book).  It's a tough book to read because my eyes repeatedly filled with tears from laughing so much:  5 stars out of 5.
I love John Varley's \\"Steel Beach\\" (I've read it three times now), but I still find that there's too much sex in it. I understand why he's got it there (a bored society), but I just don't want a sci-fi book with a sexual theme. If you pull out that, then this book is a classic. It's written in a very Heinleinish way (of course the more recent Heinlein books all revolved around sex, too). It takes a lot from Heinlein's \\"The Moon is a Harsh Mistress.\\" Wonderful book, fun to read, but don't give it to the kids.  I rate it at a Very Good 4 stars out of 5.<br /><br />The novels in John Varley's \\"Eight Worlds\\" universe are:<br /><br />1.  [[ASIN:B00AFXMAC8 The Ophiuchi Hotline]]<br />2.

First, I gave Sozhenitsyn's \\"Gulag Archipelago\\" a 4 star rating because of the style of its writing. Content-wise, this book is far beyond even a 5 star rating. As my title says, it should be mandatory reading for everyone in this country.  Regarding the style, the best I can say is it's very Russian. Solzhenitsyn uses tons of well-researched details to present his thesis. The only problem is that after a while it gets depressing. Also, he uses a heck of a lot of scathing sarcasm throughout the book. So much so, that you start to become numb to it. This isn't necessarily a bad thing, but you should be aware that this is NOT a novel. Also, it's not really a history. As the subtitle on the title page says, it's \\"An Experiment in Literary Investigation.\\" Personally, I'd have been more satisfied with a history.  The content of this book is simply inconceivable and far outweighs my minor criticisms of the style. It describes how the Communists in the Soviet Union consciously tortured and murdered millions (if not tens of millions) of their own people. With this book in print, I can't understand how anyone could ever say anything good about Communism.  It's a long book, but READ IT.  I rate it at a Very Good 4 stars out of 5.
The book \\"Dave Barry is Not Taking This Sitting Down\\" is good, solid Dave Barry. There are a few really good chapters (articles), but most of them are just standard Barry fare (which is good).  I rate it at an OK 3 stars out of 5.
Or, maybe it's an \\"Excellent Look at Capitalism from a Freedom Point of View.\\" In either case, Milton Friedman's \\"Capitalism and Freedom\\" is a very interesting book. In the first two chapters, he summarizes the principles for everything else in the book. The remaining chapters are specific applications of these principles.  Even though the book was originally written in 1962, his analyses of these situations are real eye-openers. Everything's written for reasonably normal human beings: no math or anything special required.  I rate it at an Excellent 5 stars out of 5.
The ending of Douglas Adams' \\"Mostly Harmless\\" was so bad that I vowed never to read another of his books. Adams was obviously sick and tired of the series and used this book to kill it off with absolutely no chance of its ever returning. If you liked the other books in this series, don't go anywhere near this one. I rate it at a terrible 1 star out of 5.<br /><br />The books in Douglas Adams' \\"Hitchhiker's Guide to the Galaxy\\" series are:<br /><br />1.

C.S. Lewis' \\"The Abolition of Man\\" is a fairly short, interesting piece of logic that extrapolates from an early instance of \\"Innovation\\" (an Innovator in this book is someone who wants to \\"improve\\" us by removing the innate morality from certain things) out to the extinction of mankind (hence the title).  From a single example of a new school book, he foretells exactly what will happen (and we're pretty far down that path already) to mankind via the educational establishment.  The basic thrust of the book is that if we remove the concept of innate goodness or badness in things and replace it with how we feel about those things, we lose the underpinnings that keep us human.  A very short book, but a very good one.  I rate it at a Very Good 4 stars out of 5.
Glen Cook's \\"Faded Steel Heat\\" is the 9th in his Garrett series. As are all of Glen Cook's books with the title format of [adjective][metal type][noun], this is an interesting, fun, action-packed read. It's definitely a page-turner. Unfortunately, the minor inconsistencies I noticed in the previous book seem to be propagating in this one. Some of these errors are merely editing or lack of note-checking. For instance, near the beginning of this book, Garrett's talking to CAPTAIN Block. But, from two books back, we know that Block was promoted to COLONEL. A hundred pages on, though, Cook's got Block back as a COLONEL. In another case, Garrett's looking at a captured wagon. He specifically notes ONE prisoner. A couple pages later there are TWO prisoners. One page later, THREE. More seriously, there are behavioral problems. For instance, Garrett and his harem can't keep their minds on their business. In earlier books, Garrett's womanizing didn't really interfere in his business. In this book, both he and the women just stop working on important things (like infiltrations, kidnappings and murder) for a little bit of groping. And I mean they stop right in the middle of those things: not afterwards. Also, Garrett just misses obvious clues. He narrates to us about them, but nothing apparently clicks in his head. And then there's where he takes Tinnie with him to visit the headquarters of The Call (a militant human rights group). But, as noted in earlier books, Tinnie is part elf. Nobody ever notices.<br />These problems are still minor. This is definitely a book to read (along with all the rest of the series). But, because of these discrepancies, I've lowered my rating for the book to a mere OK 3 stars out of 5.<br /><br />The books in Cook's \\"Garrett\\" series are:<br /><br />1.

As an alternative, look around for the SFBC's \\"Garrett Investigates.\\" This book is part of that collection.
I got halfway through Paul J. McAuley's \\"The Secret of Life\\" before giving up on it. If you want to read different philosophies of scientific direction and human behavior, this is the book for you. If you want to actually read a story that might entertain, look elsewhere. I rate it at a Pretty Bad 2 stars out of 5.
