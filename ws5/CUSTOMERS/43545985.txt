These days, celebrity authors earn thousands of dollars for a speech, but back in the 1880s, Ralph Waldo Emerson, the first American author known to receive payment for delivering a talk, was paid $5 and oats for his horse.

Mark Twain gave advice to a young man who wanted to be a writer: &quot;When you catch an adjective, ill it. No, I don't mean that utterly, but kill the most of them - then the rest will be valuable. They weaken when they are close together, they give strength whenthe are wide apart. An adjective-habit, or a wordy, diffuse, or flowery habit, once fastened upon a person, is as hard to get rid of as any other vice.&quot;

Whitman proposed, optimistically, that America's shortcomings would be overcome in time: \\"by recognizing the worth of common people, dramatized especially in the selfless heroism of the Civil War soldiers; by cultivating both individuality and social unity; by having faith in the electoral process ..; by permitting women to develop fully in many ways; by seeing that America is steadily developing through its current practical, business-oriented phase toward a time when great 'bards' will arise, producing a true democratic literature that will instill much-needed religiosity and moral conscience into American life.\\"
Most works on the Antarctic describe the region with a series of forbidding extremes. The continent is said to be the coldest, driest, highest, windiest, and most remote place on earth. At least one other extreme merits inclusion on this list: Antarctica also is the most neglected continent in both the practice and study of American national security policy. The reasons for this neglect are not hard to fathom. Precisely because of all Antarctica's extremes, only a handful of Americans have ever expressed an interest in the region. During the late eighteenth and early nineteenth centuries, sailors from New England explored the waters of the Southern Ocean in search of seals for trade. Later, commercial exploitation of the region's living resources gave way to heroic feats by famous explorers. The adventures of Roald Amundsen, Robert Falcon Scott, and Admiral Richard Byrd opened up the Antarctic in both a literal and figurative sense, as the popular imagination became seized with the haunting images of the last earthly frontier. Yet, for all its majestic beauty, the Antarctic never possessed sufficient wealth or strategic significance to command broad and sustained attention from the American body politic. Even as more Americans became aware of the region, Antarctica remained the province of the few. Indeed today, it is populated only by a small circle of scientists, and the civilian and military officials who support their research. Not surprisingly then, US decisionmakers have generally paid only scant attention to Antarctica. Consequently, policy toward the region traditionally has suffered from a lack of strong direction from the top and a corresponding air of ambivalence. For example, in the first half of this century, the State Department carefully laid the foundation for a territorial claim there
John Burroughs was a respected man of letters and a dedicated naturalist. This is one of Burroughs's last statements of his naturalist philosophy.
The invention of the first light bulb inaugurated a new age for man: Electricity. Just as Edison had to create the tools to make the first bulb, he had to create the industry to use it. He did, and in doing so he assembled the first research laboratory and gathered around him a collection of great minds -- a rich assortment of men with varying talents.
This volume concerns education of the physical, moral and spiritual nature, in addition to contemplating what knowledge is worth. Herbert Spencer was the pre-eminent philosopher and sociologist of the Victorian era in Britain; his views on \\"social Darwinism\\" are largely discredited today, but still latent. In his book SOCIAL STATICS, Spencer stressed the importance of individual freedom and the inevitability of human progress - with white males at the forefront of the vanguard of progress.
Burroughs was a respected man of letters and a dedicated naturalist. This was the first book to appreciate Walt Whitman's poetical prowess.
New Zealand has always been a natural wonder.  Sired by volcanoes in the middle of an emerald sea, the land is a mixture of pastures, jagged mountains, white beaches, and tropical forests.  Economically, the country is no less a marvel.  It's an excellent example of how free markets create prosperity.<br />In 1984, New Zealand voters booted a left-leaning government and brought in a free-market-oriented government.  Immediately, finance minister Sir Roger Douglas began to implement some of the most important reforms in any country of the 20th century.<br />Sir Douglas floated the currency, revoked all farm subsidies, abolished all import tariffs, privatized 60% of state-owned companies, fired 55% of the government workforce, placed the central bank chairman on a performance contract, revoked capital gains and inheritance taxes, and refused to print money to save reckless banks and inefficient companies from bankruptcy.<br />The results have been astounding.  New Zealand now has one of the lowest inflation rates in the world (1.3%), seven consecutive years of budget surpluses, 6.4% unemployment (down from 12%), and a resilient, entrepreneurial economy that soared 5.8% last year.<br />It's the kind of country, in other words, where you can build a second home to enjoy the good life -- and end up making a fortune almost by accident as the value of the property you buy rises amidst a booming economy.
Well, what have we here?  In the last 2 weeks, gold has been in the news more than Alan Greenspan!  Although analysts can't pinpoint any single reason for the most recent surge, which has driven the price of gold to an 11-month high, there are a number of things that appear to be contributing factors: (1) The Royal Bank of Canada Dominion Securities Gold Analyst raised the estimate for the spot price of gold from $275 to $300.  (2) There seems to be a short squeeze caused by a story that a large Australian mining company may declare bankruptcy.  The company in question has profitable gold hedge positions in place and may be buying the contracts back right now!  (3) The series of cuts in U.S. interest rates this year has prompted worries about a revival of inflation (which historically drives the demand of gold).  (4) Distrust of the equity markets.<br />I found this book to be very helpful in understanding the historical context, and then in learning how to use gold as an asset allocation tool to help diversify and protect my stock portfolio, but best of all was the direct practical advice on how, who and where to go to get things done in making gold investments economically.
I find wisdom, humor, and so much intelligence here.  I pass this book on to my husband and children so that they may gain from reading it.
