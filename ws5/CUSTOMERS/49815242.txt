The Colorado Front Range Bouldering Series is the first of its kind in the world, maps are hand drawn and incredibly entertaining unlike the simple processed digitized guides seen today. The book has accurracy and overviews  of all areas involved unlike the Copy Cat book Colorado Bouldering. This  book is the best value on the market for bouldering within the Fort Collins  Area. I truely enjoy having it in my almost 500 climbing guide collection.  In years to come these hand drawn books will be of more value than the  others that follow.
