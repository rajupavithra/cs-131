I'm a teacher and I find the Eyewitness books highly educational.  I like the way the concepts are presented in a form without backgrounds.  This gives clear facts to the reader without over taxing the attention span.  The books are highly informative, presenting difficult concepts in comprehendable chunks that stimulate interest.  I have almost the whole collection for my own children and they LOVE them!

A nice not-too-scary adventure with students heroes solving the puzzle, very impowering for young people. My daughter loves them and as a teacher I recommend this series for my students.
