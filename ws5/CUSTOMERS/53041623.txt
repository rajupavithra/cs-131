Very well written first novel.  It is obvious that Mr Griffin has done his homework on the subject.  At age 28 Griffin has a fine career ahead of him, and I am looking forward with much anticipation to his next book.
All the high tech hardware and action techno-thriller lovers like with the added fact that Mr Cobb is one helluva good writer.  And what a terrific character!  Amanda Garrett, the Navy's first female combat commander.  Read  all the books in the series and you'll be as hooked as I am on.  I can't  wait for the next.

A combination murder mystery, &quot;lawyer book&quot;, and supernatural thriller, featuring (initially) a throughly despicable protagonist.  Not your ordinary mystery, and not your ordinary first novel.  Mr Pyper is one  helluva writer.  Do yourself a favor and read this book.  You won't be  disappointed.
It always amazes me when an author's first novel is as well written as is this book. I hope Mr Liss has a long and successful career. He has written an absorbing and intricate thriller with a lesson for today's stock market  investors. The more things change....Do yourself a favor and read this  book.
