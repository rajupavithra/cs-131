This book has touched me in a very different way than many others have.  It is a tragic story and envelopes the reader in a different kind of sadness - a sadness which one cannot pull out of quickly or just draw aside.  Many thoughts contained in this book are worthy of reflection.  Each lingers in your heart.  The happy moments are all tinged with a bitter taste.  Each character is flawed as a natural human being and each mistake they make reflects on their future and affects them drastically.  Tess Durbeyfield is one of the most tragic characters I have ever read of.  From the moment she leaves her home to the supposed D'Urberville relatives, she is pushed into catastrophes and heartaches that just lead to more doom.  I recommend this book to any reader who is willing to undergo the myriad of emotions that accompanies Tess's journey through demise.  It is not for the flippant, unconcerned, and unsympathetic reader.  Everything that happens to Tess happens for a reason, and the reader must be able to realize how each affects her to appreciate this book.  Read this book and expect to ponder on many philosophical wonderings.  This book WILL affect you!  It is worthy of any person seeking a deep and life-affecting novel.

I must admit that the first half of this book is somewhat slow and at times quite difficult to hold attention to.  I understand that the setting, personalities, and situations must be established in the first half.  Even so, the story is a gem well worth reading.  It has quite a different feel from the other Jane Austen books and the characters stick to your mind as people you will never forget.  A few characters are quite tragic yet do not deserve sympathy, which provides an interest in the reader's mind.  Fanny Price, the main character of the book, is an admirable and intelligent person whom I would not mind modeling myself after.  This is a GREAT book, so don't miss your chance to read it.

This book was a great sequel to \\"The Face on the Milk Carton.\\"  I loved the first book, and I love this one equally. I finished this book in a couple of hours because there are so many clues along the way that you just HAVE to find out what the outcome is.  I'm going out to get the third book now!
This book was really interesting!  I love the way Caroline B. Cooney writes.  There's so much feeling on every page.  I got teary-eyed at the end of this book.  Janie, the main character, goes through so much with her family, friends, school, and her way personal life that she slowly begins to discover.  She was kidnapped when she was three years old! It was indeed a shock, and clues are dropped everywhere for the reader to pick up.  I love this book.  After reading it, I started to cherish my family a little more.
I love this book!!!  It really is my favorite.  I'm in love with the whole time travel concept!  There is no dull moment in this book at all.  I picked it up expecting just \\"eh...\\", but instead, i got \\"ah\\"s, \\"oh\\"s, *gasp*s, and so many other expressions.  I read the book in one sitting, without putting it down!<BR>There are so many emotions in this book, it's as if you're there, and you're feeling everything that they're feeling, right down to the jumping jacks that Annie's stomach must have been doing or the twitches of jealousy that almost every character had.  I loved that this book was a teen romance, fantasy, mystery, and suspense story all rolled into one.  <BR>The ending of this story was indeed a cliffhanger.  After finishing this book, I just had to go out and get the sequels.  I really enjoyed the story of the love between the two main characters from two different worlds, 1895 and 1995.  The ending is one of those where you could just read it over and over again.  It's that interesting!  I read the ending about five times!  Fantastic story!  READ THIS BOOK!!
This book was really good!  I bought it because I read the first one and I ABSOLUTELY needed to know what happened! This book fits into so many categories including romance (of course!!!), suspense, fantasy, and many more that I can't think of at the moment!  you feel so many emotions too like sadness, happiness, jealousy, bitterness, anxiousness, excitement, and of course, the feeling of butterflies in your stomach.<BR>   I picked this book up and started to read, and I couldn't put it down!  It was that good!  With every page you read, you just have to know what happens next.  The ending is really well written, but leaves you wanting to find out more, even if it wasn't even a cliffhanger as much as the first book had been.  READ THIS BOOK (after you've read the first one, of course)!!!
This book is good, but I do have to say that it is my least favorite of the whole Time series. Why? Because it isn't about Annie and Strat, but about Annie's brother Tod, and Strat's sister Devonny! Nothing against Tod and Devonny, but after the first two books, I wanted to know more about the two stars of the series; yet i do understand why there is a break in Annie and Strat's story. <BR>In this book, you feel almost every emotion, just like the other ones. The ending was nice, in more ways than one. Even if this book wasn't mainly about Annie and Strat, you understand how it plays into their situations. All I have to say is read it, but don't expect it to be your favorite book of all time.  Even though this isn't the best of the entire series, still read it because it's quite a good book and you'll want to read the fourth book.
This book was great!  I have to admit that the beginning was just mediocre, while the ending was the best part (when all the real action took place).  To really appreciate and understand this book, you'd have to have read the first three books.  Overall, I think that the first one is the best.  This story included suspense on basically every page.  The ending doesn't feel right to me.  I mean, yeah, the ending makes sense and is written well, but personally, I just don't like the end!  It makes the reader hope that another book will come out.  The ending is okay, but it made me think \\"ew!\\" and \\"cool!\\".  Read it to find out how this series ends!  You won't regret picking this book up!
