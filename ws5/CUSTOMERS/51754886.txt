Really enjoyed this book very much and found it quite enlightening. Ranks with my favorite music books, along with &quot;Drummer's Path,&quot; &quot;Breath Was The First Drummer&quot; and &quot;The Brazilian  Sound.&quot;
I would also suggest Lonely Planet Brazil, as well as a music book, &quot;The Brazilian Sound&quot; (Temple University Press), which contains a huge glossary, maps and a lot of cultural history.
Belongs on your world music shelf along with such classics as &quot;Listening to Salsa,&quot; &quot;The Brazilian Sound,&quot; and &quot;Reggae: The Rough Guide.&quot;
This book is a great help in deciphering Brazilian customs and subtle cues. I would also recommend &quot;A History of Brazil&quot; and &quot;The Brazilian Sound: Samba, Bossa Nova and the Popular Music of Brazil&quot; as  essential works that also give vital background.
This is an outstanding, invaluable guide to jazz. I recommend it fully, with just one caveat -- not enough coverage of the incredible influence of Brazilian music (percussion, bossa nova, rhythms, MPB composers) on jazz.  For that reason, one should also consult &quot;The Brazilian Sound&quot;  (Temple University Press) as a supplement to this work.
An outstanding journey through the history of jazz. It is lacking in the area of Brazilian music's incredible influence on jazz in the last 40 years; for that one should also consult &quot;The Brazilian Sound&quot;  (Temple University Press).
How marvelous of Lonely Planet to devote an entire book to one city -- and what a city. Rio is one of the most beautiful, sexy and scary places on Earth and this guide is a great help in many different ways. It does lack,  however, in the area of music -- which is an essential part of the Rio  experience. For that I would recommend &quot;The Brazilian Sound,&quot; in  order to better enjoy the clubs, samba schools, Carnaval parades and  dancetarias of Rio.
This well-researched work is a revelation for anyone interested in the roots of American popular music, be it rock, jazz or pop. A good complement to this book is &quot;The Brazilian Sound,&quot; which covers Brazilian  music and has additional information on the influence of Brazilian  musicians on American music.
I enjoyed this book because of its widespread coverage of both American and international jazz musicians. It's an excellent musical resource which has a place in my music library alongside with such user-friendly guides as  &quot;World Music: The Rough Guide&quot; and &quot;The Brazilian  Sound.&quot;
The book is full of insight into &quot;world music,&quot; which is mainly a marketing concept but also encompasses most of the world's popular music! This is an academic work that is also enjoyable to read and complements  well those studies that focus on the artists and music, such as &quot;World  Music: The Rough Guide&quot; and &quot;The Brazilian Sound.&quot;
I enjoyed this book very much. If you have this, &quot;Reggae Bloodlines&quot; and &quot;Catch a Fire,&quot; you have quite a comprehensive overview of the reggae phenomenon. &quot;Reggae: The Rough  Guide&quot; is an indispensable World Music book, along with such must-have  volumes as &quot;The Brazilian Sound&quot; and &quot;World Music: The Rough  Guide.&quot;
This is a remarkable work that fits African music into its cultural context and is consistently provocative and enlightening. It's a world music classic, along with such studies as &quot;The Latin Tinge,&quot;  &quot;The Brazilian Sound&quot; and &quot;Catch a Fire.&quot;
This is an intriguing work that shows the relationship between drumming, spirit and health. An interesting complement to such world-music classics as &quot;The Brazilian Sound&quot; and &quot;Catch a Fire&quot; that delve  heavily into rhythm and percussion.
A fascinating musical journey and also a must for those who are into ethnic / world music. Now occupies a space on my shelf beside &quot;World Music: The Rough Guide&quot; and &quot;The Brazilian Sound.&quot;
Enjoyed the insight into the history of Merengue and its cultural context. This book has a place on my bookshelf along with &quot;The Latin Tinge&quot; and &quot;The Brazilian Sound.&quot;
This is a must-have reference book that is of great use to the jazz aficionado. It does have one glaring flaw, though -- not enough coverage of bossa nova and jazz influenced by Brazilian music (think of the hundreds of  jazz interpretations of Jobim's compositions). For that I would recommend  &quot;The Brazilian Sound,&quot; which includes 1,000 titles in its  discography.

Enjoyed the scope and ambition of this book, which educates you well about the remarkable number of musical genres that have emerged from the Caribbean. Has a place on my &quot;world music&quot; shelf along with  &quot;World Music: The Rough Guide&quot; and &quot;The Brazilian  Sound.&quot;

This book has some beautiful images of the great river that capture its vastness, heat, humidity and atmosphere. A good addition to the Brazilian bookshelf, along with books like &quot;The Brazilians&quot; and &quot;The  Brazilian Sound.&quot;
This is a marvelous guidebook, replete with useful and interesting information on any and all aspects of Amazonia, from the flora and fauna to the people and culture. It only is lacking in one respect -- coverage of  Brazilian music, which is another &quot;environmental&quot; element that  surrounds you wherever you travel in Brazil, from Manaus to Rio. For that,  I also recommend a book called &quot;The Brazilian Sound,&quot; which is an  excellent musical guidebook.
It is a very comprehensive, useful and well-organized guide. But there is not nearly enough about world music artists. For that, you need to turn to &quot;World Music: The Rough Guide&quot; or &quot;The Brazilian  Sound.&quot;
It is an interesting book, though not one of Updike's best. It did however spark my curiosity about Brazil and eventually inspired me to delve  into writers I knew nothing about -- such as Jorge Amado and Machado de Assis.  Wonderful stuff! Another revelation was &quot;The Brazilian Sound,&quot;  which is a vivid introduction to samba and bossa nova. So, Updike's book  did have an effect...
Besides enlightening us about the art of belly dancing, this book takes us deeply into the sociological and cultural context that surrounds it, and explores all its ramifications. It's got a place on my &quot;world  music&quot; book shelf alongside such classics as &quot;The Brazilian  Sound.&quot;
Skidmore has been writing about Brazilian history for several decades now and is one of the top American authorities on the subject. This is a fascinating look at five centuries in a fascinating country. It  unfortunately doesn't have enough information on Brazilian music (which is  a vital part of the culture), but for that there are books like &quot;The  Brazilian Sound.&quot;
Perrone's academic study of six leading Brazilian musicians and their lyrics (song texts) is a remarkable, groundbreaking effort that demonstrates the high level of lyric writing in Brazilian popular music in  the 1970s and 1980s. An essential volume for anyone interested in Brazilian  music and it fits well with the other classic study, &quot;The Brazilian  Sound&quot; (Temple University Press), which focuses on the music.
Eakin certainly provides an in-depth, panoramic survey of Brazil that is quite interesting. As to &quot;Brazil being the country of the future,&quot; that's really a tired old cliche. Brazil is what it is, and  it's not a world power. As far as Eakin's book goes, it covers most  everything except for the very important category of music -- for that I  would recommend &quot;The Brazilian Sound&quot; (Temple University Press).
This book is an excellent guide to the cuisine of Brazil, which has a vast array of regional specialties, spices, fruits and fish. If you go to the Amazon, Bahia or Rio, for example, you're going to encounter quite  different menus. &quot;Eat Smart&quot; is one of my key Brazil guides,  along with the music book &quot;The Brazilian Sound.&quot;
The book is unique in its wide range of viewpoints and subject matter. Interesting to see Brazil covered this way. I found it very helpful when I went to Brazil, along with the books &quot;Lonely Planet: Brazil&quot; and  &quot;The Brazilian Sound&quot; (Temple University Press).
This is a good introduction to the major figures of world music and is a handy companion for anyone exploring the music. My other favorite world music book is &quot;The Brazilian Sound&quot; (Temple University Press,  1998), which I also purchased through amazon.com.
A fascinating study of the legendary Bob Marley. My other favorite world music book is &quot;The Brazilian Sound&quot; (Temple University Press, 1998), which I also purchased through amazon.com.
Schnabel's book has beautiful graphics and is well presented in an easy-to-read format. It is a good introduction to the major figures of world music and fills us in a little on their lives and cultural contexts.  My other favorite world music book is &quot;The Brazilian Sound&quot;  (Temple University Press, 1998), which I also purchased through amazon.com.
I loved the first &quot;Brazilian Sound,&quot; which was from Billboard Books and this new revised version from Temple University Press is even better. Especially liked the in-depth musical history about samba, choro  and Bahia. Plus the glossary is outstanding.
&quot;Samba&quot; is a pretty good read, but evidentally the author only spent a short time in Brazil doing her research. It's very superficial in terms of cultural and racial issues. And its musical analysis is WAY off  the mark. She knows nothing about samba. There are much better books out  there about samba and Brazilian music.
Superficial, lame, irritating and full of mistakes. Why was this even published?
