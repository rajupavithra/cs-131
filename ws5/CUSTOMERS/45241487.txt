Wilhelm Reich was many things in his lifetime- a student of Freud, a political activist, a research scientist, and an inventor.  His work was decades ahead of its time and is finally being rediscovered and reevaluated by the public.  If, like me, you are interested in Reich and his work, you might want to check out a novel called We All Fall Down, by Brian Caldwell.  it draws heavily on Reich's theories, particularly Listen Little Man and The Mass Psychology Of Facism.  It's a great introduction to Reich's work and the entire novel draws heavily on his theory.  It's very interesting watching an author explore his theories in a fictional setting.  Well worth reading.
