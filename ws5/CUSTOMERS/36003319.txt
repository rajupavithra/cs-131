The author and syndicated reporter Sue Russell has really done a masterpiece in the book `Lethal Intent' about one of America's most cold-blooded female serial killers, Aileen Carol Wournos. <br />Aileen got her wishes come true. She wanted to do something no other woman had ever done before and she wanted fame and books written about her. Seven men had to die before this happened - executed by a man-hating cold-blooded woman. The book tells you about her childhood sufferings and prostitution in a very young age. Her family members and friends tells about her life, as well as about her intimate relationship to the lesbian Tyria Moore, who stayed by her side even that she knew Aileen was a murderer. You'll follow her life to the very end and her fight to go free. <br />Sue Russell has done a tremendous amount of research for this book and she has done it right. She has interviewed the families of the victims, her own family and friends, Tyria Moore's friends and included 16 pages of photos of Aileen and her victims. <br />The book got me hooked from the very first page; it's very well-written and it could as well be read as a novel you just can't let go off again. If you're into true crime, welcome the 557 pages of exiting and chocking reading.
The bonding between mother and daughter is very hard to break  no matter what kind of childhood youve had. Hard feelings can be hidden for years before they can be forgotten and youll be able to forgive. <br />For the author Gail Michael, the forgiveness came when her mother was dying. What had happened in the past was something they didnt even discuss, when Gail again found the courage to make contact with her mother. It was obvious that through their hidden love and bonding, forgiveness was the invisible factor blowing in the wind.<br />Gail Michael is telling her true story about her difficult relationship with her mother, her capability to forgive, about grief and an everlasting love between a parent and child that should always be there. <br />Its also a story about trying to understand one another and learning about what the other went through and struggled with. Gail and her mother finally open their hearts to each other till the very end when Gail releases her mothers ashes to the wind. <br />This is a self-help book for everyone dealing with grief when a family member  especially a parent  is dying. Are you able to forgive? Are you going to say good-bye the right way?
This is the true and amazing story about a missionary couple's four years in another country and culture so much different from what they know.<br /> <br />If you think missionary work is `romantic' - think again! Barbara followed her very remarkable and charismatic husband, Ralph to the Dominican Republic, where she actually had a culture shock and struggled with everything that was new to her - the language, the heat and the two-inch cockroaches - just to name a few of them.<br /> <br />Ralph - on the other hand - adored the place, the people, the other culture and the music and did whatever it would take to make Barbara feel comfortable in their new home.<br /> <br />The book is written in letter form - especially from the correspondence of her best friend, Sue, but also from letters to her family and other friends. She reveals everything there is to know about being a missionary in another culture and is most honest about it. I'll really recommend this book to everyone who wants to read a real person's memoir and get a realistic insight in a woman's life among strangers.
\\"Mommy, if I died, would you miss me? Would you cry?\\" She said: \\"What would I have to cry about? I'd have one less mouth ta feed!\\" Then she started laughing and said: \\"No, I'm just kiddin'. I probably would cry because I'd have ta come up with the money ta bury yer little worthless [self]. Course, I could always just stick a hame bone up yer [butt] and let the dogs drag yer off.\\" <br />This statement was a part of everyday life for author Trena Cole and her six siblings. `Charred Souls' is a book about child abuse in a way you wouldn't be able to imagine if you haven't been there yourself. Unfortunately, events like these take place in many families. Can you even call it a family? Trena Cole and her six siblings were the victims of their parents' twisted, sadistic and degrading game play. They seemed to be born to be abused verbally, emotional and physically.<br />It took a lot of courage and strength for Trena Cole to tell her story and it is as heartbreaking as it is devastating. The story starts from the age of four years old where she is able to remember what happens. Trena had no childhood at her own as she was the oldest and forced to be a little mother of her siblings and saw herself caught in what she calls a `babyfactory'. Her mother and stepfather were directly mean and sadistic and still are till this day. They forced recreational abuse on their children - simply for the fun of it. <br />`Charred Souls' describes the `side effects' of mentally and physically abused children and that not every child reacts the same way. She tells us about the verbal abuse that were so damaging that she really believed that she was ugly, stupid and worthless and tried everything she could to be worth her parents. Her and her siblings also believed that all families lived like this, because they didn't know anything else. It describes how you cope with it later in life and that some scars will always be there. <br />`Charred souls' took me through more than one broken heart,many nightmares and many hateful thoughts. Abused children think it's their own fault that they are getting abused. They believe it's normal to live this way. They do everything they can to please their parents. They are divided between love and hate, and don't really know the difference. Also as adults they haven't found the right way of living and still believe it was their fault. If you've been abused, this book can help you in realizing that it was never your fault. That you were supposed to be loved. That you are not worthless and stupid. This book is also for those who are spouses, lovers, friends or acquaintances of abused people, to help understand what they are going through - both then and now.

Speaking from my own point of view when trying to pursuing my dream, I have faced the fear of failure. I think we all have in some way, more or less.

When I first met the author Vanessa Ebner, I felt I'd found an angel. I read an inspirational article of hers and immediately joined her Angel's group. Here I kept reading her nurturing thoughts - day by day - and it gave me inspiration and relief to move on with whatever I was doing. <br />Now Vanessa Ebner's nurturing thoughts are released in the book `Hear the Angels Whisper.' In this book you get a daily guidance to release stress and seek inspiration. A new angel is talking to you every day. It can be the Angel of New Beginnings, the Angel of Light, the Angel of Charity, the Angel of Growing and Unfolding, the Angel of Trust and I could go on! I'm so grateful that this book was sent to me - now I use it to see `Who is my angel of today?' You can use this guidance year for year but I would love to see more inspirational books from Vanessa. <br />Vanessa Ebner was guided by the angels to write this book since her mother died in 1997. It was a part of her grief process to write down what the angels told her. We are not alone on this earth - there is always someone with you - all you have to do is to ask for the help, inspiration and guidance.<br />`Hear the Angels Whisper' is a book for everybody and not only for people with problems in their lives. But for anybody who has a desire for words and seek inspiration.

We've all been there. Our faithful and beloved friend has in some way betrayed us. It's hurtful and painful and we react in different ways in different situations. \\"When Friendship Hurts\\" is the second and latest book in Dr. Jan Yagers friendship series and a follow up book on Friendshifts®. <br />We make many friends in a lifetime, but only a few are friends for life. \\"When Friendship Hurts\\" gives you insight in selecting friends that are good for you - to select the wolves from sheeps. I especially like chapter 2: `Detecting harmful people before they are friends'. In this chapter you'll find 21 different types of potentially negative friends. By reading through each type I can easily recognize which types my bad friends from the past are. It can also help you to predict whether a friendship will turn out good or not before bonding.<br />More insights are such as: why are friends hurting friends? Are there different rules at work? Can we break the pattern and find good friends.<br />In these days, Jan Yager is finalizing her third book on friendships. The area she studies here is friendship at work. I'm looking very much forward to her coming books.

No matter what stage in life we are in, friends are needed for sharing experiences and receiving support whether if good or bad things happen to us. They are our mental `lifesavers' and without them we do much worse and are more woundable. Like our family, our friends are the reason for the persons we are and participate in shaping our life as we grow. <br />The author, Dr. Jan Yager has a Ph.D in sociology and her books are also based on interviews and surveys. She has created the word Friendshifts® to show us the way our friendships change as we go from one stage in life to another. <br />Our friendships change as our life does. We make friends in our childhood, as teens, as adults, and in our elderly life. We form new friends by moving, change in interests, entering a new school or getting a new job, a promotion or a new sport.<br />More insights in this book are how to be a better friend, how to prevent a friendship from ending and how we handle it when it does. Furthermore, it tells us about friendships at work and gender friendships.

For 4 years I was stuck in a bad job and what really surprised me was that I didn't realize it, before I'd been there for 2 years. A job is your identity. The first thing people ask is `So what do you do (for a living)?' Then it's great to be able to say `I'm a.....' or `I work at...' I suppose that's why I didn't think much about why I had this job. Is it for the money? Well...yeah! Is it a job where I can develop? NO! After the first two years I started daydreaming. I wished I sat at my computer and wrote. I wished I could be at home and away from people who always expected me to be satisfied with what I did. Then I started asking myself `What do YOU want?' I knew I didn't want to be in this job no longer. I wanted to follow my dream. But it still had to take me two more years before I asked the manager to fire me.<br />I followed my dream and what I do today, I really love! I can't get enough of my job. I work 60 hours a week from my home and I just LOVE it! I've never felt this way about a job before. Writing is my first love (when it comes to jobs!) - being a publisher, my second. When I started on this people said `that sounds interesting...but can you live on it?' That's the point in life for many people. It doesn't matter whether you love/like your job or not - just make sure you make money. That just didn't work for me.<br />You spend almost half your life on your job. Make sure it's the right one, or you'll never feel happiness. This is what author S. Louise Underdahl, Ph.D., is trying to tell us in her book `The Soul of work'. Reading this book made me realize I did the right thing. If you're not happy with what you do, seek inspiration in this book. It's worth it!
When you tell your children to get ready for bath what do they do? Immediately they run into their room to find toys to play with in the water. The bath must be journey before they think it's fun. This is the issue in `Tub Toys' - a cute and funny children's picture book co-written by Terry Miller Shannon and her son Timothy Warner. <br />The real `star' in this book is Timothy Warner's son Liam who gave inspiration to the creation of this book. When the book arrived in the mail to me I showed it to my three year old daughter, and she LOVED it! The book is written in verses and has wonderful and funny illustrations done by Lee Calderon. <br />There is no limit of what the little boy in the book is taking with him in the tub. A bit sad about that he only has ONE bath duck; he takes revenge and throws all other animals in the tub, so his duck won't be lonely. How it all ends I won't tell you; but how do his parents handle this situation?<br />This book is the perfect gift for a young child. The illustrations are many and are the perfect affect for conversation with the child. I can tell you it was funny to see what my daughter got out of this book. It's a fiver!
Seven years of research and self-exploring resulted in the book `A Voyage in Consciousness.' A.J. McGettigan, a 41 year-old author grew up in Pennsylvania, but moved to California soon after his 18th birthday. He needed to get away to explore many things inside himself and now was the time to learn how to dance. To dance to many different songs as we will have to learn to deal with many different people in different relationships. <br />The book focuses on how we must be aware of our inner feelings and consciousness before we can `mingle' with other people to create relationships. McGettigan tells us about scarcity consciousness and abundance consciousness and these concepts are the keywords through the book.<br />My favorite chapter was `Dancing to the many songs.' It was in this chapter my consciousness awoke and made me think about the importance of my own consciousness in proportion to those I'm closest to. If you meet a person you fall in love with or get a new job there will always be something new to explore and learn. It can take months - even years - to get the steps right to the rhythm of the song. <br />This book is a very interesting read both for young adults and those older adults who are still in search for their inner self. It's never too late to learn how to dance to a new song.
After reading a huge amount of self-help books, `Taming the Beast Within', is definitely very unusual. The self-help subjects are - to name some of them - loss and control of weight, stress management, self-esteem and control of your own happiness. M.H. Weiss starts - funny enough - with `The beginning' and will guide you to success.<br />This book is a journey starting with the birth of the universe and ends in our world today. Our lives are compared to a lot of things we have probably never thought about and this will make us think. The author's style is provoking and humorous and it's all for a reason. To provoke our thoughts in the direction that will fit into our own life. <br />This book will be most enjoyable for male readers - perhaps for some female. When I'm saying that, it's because of the many scientific explanations that usually bore the common woman who is just looking for the facts. You'll have to read a lot to find what you expect, but it'll come. <br />M.H. Weiss is a `rich' reader himself and his book is based on a lot of research and of course his own experiences. Even though he doesn't have a PhD behind his name, he has done a great job on this book. Weiss knows what he is talking about and tells his story from his own angle - take it or leave it.
We're all searching for answers in our lives no matter what `stage of life' we're in. We wonder why we're miserable, unhappy, why we have low self-confidence or why we feel we're getting nowhere. Sometimes we think we know the answer, but as time grows we find out that our unhappiness is based on things we would never have thought possible.<br />We go to therapists, psychologists or counsellors to find the answers - until we must realize the answers are deeply ingrained in ourselves. Search your mind and heart and see that you already know them.<br />What happened to the author, Tony Arnold was a journey that will mark him for life. Tony had lost his job, his wife and home and he had no desire to go on with his life as he had created it. He held his baby daughter in his arms and quietly said: \\"God, use me now or take me and provide for this precious little girl.\\" He went to bed that evening only to wake up to hear a voice inside his head saying: \\"Write.\\" In Tony's frustration and confusion he promptly asked: \\"What am I supposed to write?\\" \\"Write down what I tell you,\\" was the answer. Here Tony's journey with God began and resulted in this book.<br />`The Light Upon my Path' is a journey of a common man's conversations with God. Not that Tony was particularly religious at the time being, but he kept his belief in his heart in his own way. Today he sees things differently and his belief has grown in a way his that will help him to survive. This book hooked me from the very first page and will touch any human being's heart. It creates different emotions coming and going and will make you eye your own life in another perspective.  Begin your own journey today!
