I thoroughly enjoyed Jan Morris' survey of the 19th century British Empire.  Having studied this topic from numerous other sources and perspectives, I still found this to be a refreshing account, and one that tied numerous facets into a cohesive whole.  While some might regard Morris as writing with too much of a pro-British bias, I did not find the lack of politically-correct 'empire-bashing' to be problematic.  Indeed, Morris emphasizes the negative (and the ludicrous) right alongside the positive.  In the few instances where the perspective is obviously skewed, the informed student of history can easily read between the lines.  In short, for the curious, I recommend this as the finest single volume on this topic, both for its informative content and its exciting, engaging writing style.  I look forward to reading more of Morris' works.
50.00 for a paperback book only a few years old, which is mostly a collection of easily accessible infromation?  Outrageous.
This book is one of a series by Nigel Wheatley (I think that this is the only one co-authored by David Brewer) which covers many of the world's birding hotspots.  All make for good reading for the traveling birder, and are especially good during the very earliest phase of trip planning - ie, choosing a destination.  Considering the scope of the book, it is understandably brief and shallow, which is its greatest shortcoming.  I could envision the next edition doubling in girth, and still omitting a lot!   The segment on Mexico is particularly skimpy - whole regions, rich with endemic birds, are left out - such as the Acapulco/Guerrero region.  On the other hand, the Lesser Antilles are treated a bit more completely.  But, this book (and the series) is really the first of its kind, and every serious or casual neotropical birder will benefit from reading it.
I will be brief - I find this to be the best field guide to the birds of any neotropical region currently available, and I pretty much have studied them all on depth! The only guides that come close to this level of usefulness are Hilty's Columbia field guide and the new Ridgely/Greenfield Ecuador 2 volume set.  This book has excellent, seasonally specific range maps, and illustrates many plumage variations.  I am astonished to read other reviews in which this book is considered cumbersome, because all too often smaller, lighter books sacrifice completness of information and thoroughness, which compromises their usefulness.  True, it's a hefty volume, but it treats a complex avifauna without sacrificing necessary information.  The other criticism I was surprised by was that the pictures were too &quot;cartoonlike&quot;; I have found these plates to be some of the most useful in the field, for they emphasize key characteristics with clarity.  In the field, simplicity is far more practical than overly-detailed artwork which may be more lifelike, but blurs the differences between species.  Anyway, praise for Howell!  May this volume set an example for future field guides throughout Latin America!
Anybody who has enjoyed other writings by Alexander Skutch on the subject of neotropical birds will also appreciate this book.  After all, where else can you find interesting and informative writing about these two large and important families of neotropical birds?  Not only is there a wealth of data concerning behavior, habitat, etc - but it is all presented in Skutch's very personal style, and intermingled with intimate anecdotes that really put you right there in the forest with that Bicolored Antbird, etc.  Read this book before birding in lowland rainforest in Central or South America, and you will be rewarded with a much greater understanding of what you are witnessing.  If you haven't yet, also read &quot;A Birdwatcher's Adventures in Central America&quot;, and &quot;A Naturalist in Costa Rica&quot;, as well as &quot;Birds Asleep&quot; - all by Alexander Skutch.

Ridgely's guide is the best - and really the only - available field guide covering all the species of birds in the nation of Panama.  While it is useful and serves most purposes, it has been over a decade since the second edition was released, and it is more than due for an overhaul and expansion.  The most necessary would be the addition of range maps, that would make the book infinitely more useful in planning a trip.  At the very least, there should be a single, detailed map of Panama, indicating the locations mentioned in the range descriptions!  Also, it would be better to limit the scope of the book entirely to Panama, as Costa Rica and other areas to the north are covered by other guides, and the pertinent information for those areas in this book are scant, at best.  Then, the isolated plates in the back need to be intergrated, as do the plates of Darien specialties, etc.  Many species have been recently added to the Panama list, or split, etc, and those species need to be added.  But, all this aside, this book should enable the identification of most Panama birds, and remains an indispensible resource for any birder traveling to that country.

I can appreciate the author's intent - to create a more comprehensive guide to the wildlife of a region that is sorely lacking in accesible information.  It is a pioneering effort, and I am grateful that such guides are being attempted.  But after reviewing the bird plates I became quite upset - this guide will lead to many misidentifications due to innacurate portrayals and information, as well as omissions.  While I can understand the impossibility of covering all the living species in a large and diverse region, it would be nice if the ones chosen were depicted accurately, and reference was made to similar species occuring within other parts of the covered range.  For just one example, plate 45 shows four species of Motmot as being the ame size and shape, when the Tody Motmot is HALF the size (and a very different shape) of the others.  While this is indicated (in small print), anyone relying on the pictures could easily become confused.  Beletsky list Howell's excellent &quot;Guide to the Birds of Mexico and Northern Central America&quot; in his references, but he clearly should have been paying more attention!  As to omissions, if an abbreviated list is desired in the interest of keeping this book accesible for the more casual enthusiast, it would have been far better to at least focus on the species most likely to be encountered.  While some rarely seen species are included, many quite visible and common birds are left out!  And how could Beletsky leave out the Boat-billed Heron?  Not only is this species an icon amongst Mexican birds, but it is a favorite species for boat tour operators on both coasts to find for visitors!  After seeing what the bird plates are like, how could I ever feel positive about identifying other wildlife using this book?<BR>On the positive side, I will reiterate that I am glad that such books are being written.  There is often no information available (in practical form) on tropical reptiles, amphibians, invertebrates, etc.  But I hope guides like this will get a whole lot better!  Skimping on information for portability is not the answer.  Accuracy should be far more important.  In Beletsky's favor are the habitat photos, and coverage of ecotourism and conservation issues.
Do not go birding in Mexico without first procuring a copy of this invaluable book!  Last summer a friend and I undertook a succesful three week birding road trip throughout western Mexico, and most of our route was planned directly from this book!  There is a relative scarcity of information on finding birds in Mexico.  Visit southern Texas or Arizona, and you can easily obtain a dozen helpful volumes.  Cross the border, and you are hard pressed to track down any useful information - but this book is certainly the best of what is currently available.  Written by the same man who authored the superb and definitive field guide to the birds of Mexico, it covers most of the important regions of Mexico(a &quot;mega&quot; bio-diversity country), and points you in the right direction to search for every single one of Mexico's 115 endemic and 25 near-endemic species.  On our trip we visited nearly every site described in chapters 5, 6, and 7.  We enjoyed the luxury, thanks to this book, of showing up at remote places in a foreign country and immediately getting down to business of birding the best spots, without wasting time exploring or scouting - as if we were at a local wildlife refuge back home!<BR>I eagerly anticipate future editions.  There is room for improvement here, as well as expansion.  I can envision this book doubling in scope, without andy redundancy.  More and more birders are venturing into Mexico, and this book is helping pave the way.  The number one improvement I hope to see is a dramatic enlargement of appendix B, which deals with sites for finding species of particular interest.  I would like to see that expand to offer a few paragraphs of information per species, rather that a vauge line or two.  Also, a few of the directions will need revision and updating (although most were right on!).  Finally, I hope to see a lot more sites described within a day's drive of the border.<BR>In short, unless you are accompanying an organized tour group, your birdwatching experience in Mexico will be far, far richer for having this book - and if you are anything like me, you will read and re-read it prior to your birding trip until you have almost memorized parts of it.
This is a pleasant, well-written book, that transported me throughout some of Mexico's natural regions from my armchair.  Those with experience searching for birds in Mexico will find that this book awakens charming memories.  Others may long wistfully to explore the beautiful and unusual habitats found south of the border.  I particularly liked chapter 12 - &quot;Place of the Tufted Jay&quot;, which included a photo of the Hotel Villa Blanca, where I have also stayed while pursuing the local endemic, the Tufted Jay.  The author watched Swifts from the roof of the hotel.
As a newcomer to the Northwest, I sought a book that would enable me to identify the various seashells I had begun to collect on area beaches.  This book is the only complete &quot;non-scientific&quot; field-guide type of text I have found on the subject.  In other words, species are referenced by English common names, rather than simply by their more correct, but intimidating Latin names.  All species are depicted in color photographs, with corresponding descriptions of habits, habitat, physical features, abundance, etc.  Of particular interest are the color photos of the &quot;shows&quot;, or siphons, of buried live bivalves.  <BR>There is some room for improvement in a future edition.  I would like to see more specific information on distribution and abundance, collecting techniques, and on distinguishing species of similar appearance.  However, it is the best existing guide to the topic that I yet know of, and it has greatly expanded my knowledge and enjoyment of Northwest shells.
