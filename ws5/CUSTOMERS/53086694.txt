I was swept away by this book and read it in one sitting.  For readers familiar with Morton Kondracke through his appearances on television or through his writings, this is a suprisingly warm and touching account.  It is greatly to his credit that its warmth and honesty shine so clearly. <br />Kondracke is open, honest, and extremely candid in his assessment of his marriage and himself.  Here is a man who clearly gained insight from his own therapy experiences and from the loving and constant pressure from his wife to force him to grow.  For an example of how one's narcissism can gradually be overcome, this book is worth reading.  But it is so much more.<br />One gets a vivid picture of the intimate workings of a marriage, the strengths and weaknesses of their child rearing, and the battle between career and family.  One also comes away with great affection for both Morton and Milly and their deep love and devotion for each other.<br />But there is still more.  The description of the insidious progression of Parkinson's disease, the phases of wishful thinking, despairing realization, heroic fighting, valiant perseverence, and ultimately honest recognition of where things will lead, constitute an inspiring if also discouraging saga.  The direct discussion of the alternatives facing Milly and Morton as they peer into the dark future are bracing -- chilling in their implications and invigorating in their honesty and bluntness.<br />There is still more.  The story of the politics of medical research, the duplicity of politicians, the disproportionate allocation of research resources, and even the difficulties and disagreements of the &quot;good guys,&quot; such as the conflicts between the Fox foundation and the PAN, are wrenching for the reader.  &quot;Why can't potentially curable diseases get the resources they need?&quot; the reader asks in frustration.  It seems that only those personally touched by tragedy rise to the occasion, as is the case with politicians whoare as different as Tom Harkin and Connie Mack.  <br />Yet there is still more to this book.  There is the story of love and friendship.  There are friends who stand by in generous support at the times of greatest trial and others who fade away.  Always there is the deep love between Morton and Milly.<br />Finally there is God and philosophy.  I found Kondracke's &quot;Christian Stoicism&quot; to be very much in accord with my own views.  One does the best with the hand one is dealt, asking God to help keep us strong during the ordeal.  Whenever Kondracke asks God what he should be doing, God answers, &quot;Take care of Milly.&quot;  We don't often get miraculous divine intervention to take away our trials.  But we can ask for and receive strength from God to deal with them in a loving and even heroic way.  <br />Milly Kondracke is the hero of the book, but so is Mort Kondracke.  So too are their friends and everyone working for the cure of Parkinson's and other degenerative diseases.  The book itself is sometimes harsh, sometimes sad, sometimes infuriating, but always uplifting and inspirational.  <br />Very highly recommended.
Alan Blyth is a long time critic for the British magazine Gramophone.  He is also the author of a series of books called Opera on Record.  The Opera on CD series, which was originally published in 1992, with yearly revisions in 1993 and 1994, is the successor to the Opera on Record volumes.  <br />The  operas are presented chronologically by the era in which the composer  lived.  Thus the first composer is Monteverdi, then Purcell, moving on to  Gluck, Mozart, etc.  Only the major works of each composer are reviewed.   The book focuses on recordings.  Therefore very little about the composer  himself or the plot of the opera is discussed.  <br />Blyth selects from one  to three recommended recordings and goes into some detail regarding the  virtues and drawbacks of each.  He is very thorough in explaining how he  arrived at his decisions, so that if you prefer a certain singer over a  superior conductor, for example, you know which version has what qualities.   <br />Over the years I have read many books on opera.  Collecting opera  recordings can be quite expensive.  Therefore one turns to reliable critics  whose taste in music is compatible with one's own.  I do not always agree  100% with Blyth, but I have never hated one of his recommendations, and  have generally liked the recordings he has advocated.  His are the most  reliable I have seen, and I trust his taste.<br />If you can locate this book,  do so at once.  The publisher would be wise to reissue an updated version  in the near future.  However, as Alan Blyth has been at this for many  decades, his personal contribution may be drawing to an end.  If that is  so, then it makes Opera on CD an even more valuable acquisition.  <br />Very  highly recommended.
Those who know Thomas Mann for his weightier books will be surprised to see how light this short novel is.<br />Felix Krull is a &quot;Con Man.&quot;  This book recounts his early years, from early childhood, through his ingenious method of avoiding being drafted into the army, to  his initial jobs.  He avoids the army by appearing too eager to join, thus  inducing suspicion regarding his mental stability.  He works his way up by  recognizing that having a good appearance and a willing attitude more than  compensates for lack of experience or ability.  Being a confidence man  requires supreme self-confidence and Felix has that in abundance.<br />For me  the pivotal scene is when Felix is taken to the theater by his father to  see a play in which one of the father's old school chums is starring.  Felix is captivated by the magnetic attraction between audience and star.  This is made even greater by the back stage visit he and his father make  after the show.  The star turns out to be much shorter than he appeared to  be, with reddish hair instead of black, and rough skin instead of the  smooth skin he appeared to have.  His manner is coarse, not like the  refined character he portrayed.  Topping it off, he is in need of  continuous reassurance that he did a good job, whereas the character he  played was supremely confident and poised.  This is the key to Felix's  realization that for most of the world illusion is reality, and that the  illusionist needs the audience just as the audience needs the illusionist.<br />Whether Mann had a sequel planned is uncertain.  We do leave Felix as a  young man, wondering what his further adventures and potential growth might  have been.<br />As it is, this is a delightful story with a profound  subtext.  Are there any people like Felix around today?
This is my favorite opera guide and general reference.  It contains brief biographies of the composers, detailed but not overly long synopsis of the plot, given act by act, a brief overview of the performance history, a critical appraisal of the opera itself, and a very thoughtful discography  demonstrating excellent musical taste.  The work is presented  alphabetically by composer, and chronologically by work for each composer.   The writing style is clear, advanced but not pedantic, and should be  accessible to beginners as well as to opera buffs.  As if this weren't  enough, there are historic photographs of key performances throughout the  years.  <br />The vision of opera is open-minded and broad.  Porgy and Bess is  here.  So is Gilbert and Sullivan.  When an opera exists in different  manuscript versions, such as Verdi's Don Carlo or Simon Boccanegra, all  variations are discussed.  <br />Since opera is somewhat expensive to collect,  listeners will want to have some guidance as to which recordings to  purchase.  Here the Viking Guide is particularly good.  Many of the  suggested recordings are selected by Alan Blyth, author of Opera on Record  and Opera on CD (both very highly recommended, by the way), as well as long  time reviewer for Gramophone magazine.  I don't always rank recordings  exactly as Blyth does, but I find his taste to be the most reliable of any  of the critics whom I follow.  <br />This volume was originally published in  1993, but is now very hard to find.  The publishers have printed an  abridged version under the Penguin Guide series.  I understand they are  also coming out with a CD-ROM version of the full Viking Guide. I can  safely recommend both these alternative versions as well as my trusty  hardcover version.<br />There are other valuable opera guides.  The series  published by Norton of the Metropolitan Opera Guide to Recorded Opera and  to Opera Plots is excellent.  But for a single volume reference work,  nothing surpasses theViking Guide.  Amanda Holden and her team have done a  splendid job.  <br />Very highly recommended.
Last year I wrote an extensive review of the various college guides.  Our daughter was then in eleventh grade and just beginning her serious consideration of colleges.  Now she has heard from all her schools  (accepted at 8, waiting list at 1, rejected at 1) and an update seems  appropriate.  <br />The Princeton Review guide is probably the best condensed  book for a quick overview.  They have improved their format slightly from  1999, though most of the text of their descriptions is the same.  However  they do give a flavor for the political orientation, difficulty getting in  index, academic prestige, student to faculty ratio, and quality of campus  life.<br />The Fiske guide is also useful, though my own view is that he tries  to say only nice things about each school. <br />The ISI Guide to Choosing the  Right College has definite strengths and weaknesses.  The strength or  weakness depends on your philosophical orientation.  It takes a center  right political view and a traditional academic view.  It therefore praises  schools with a core curriculum and a minimum of political correctness and  criticizes institutions which have few or no required courses and a left  leaning tendency.  However, they make their views fully explicit, so the  reader can adjust according to their preferences.  The greatest strength is  that it names actual professors and lists their courses.  Thus these can be  avoided or sought after as the student sees fit.  Most other guides stick  to generalities and avoid specifics. <br />Again I strongly endorse Marty  Nemko's You're Gonna Love This College Guide.  See my full review for  details.  The strength of this book is that it gets the student to think in  terms of big versus small, urban versus rural, highly competitive versus  high quality without cut-throat competition, etc.  It really helped our  daughter know what to think about on her tour of colleges.<br />A few more  tips.  We found it extremely helpful to look at colleges during spring  break of eleventh grade, and again in the fall of twelfth.  The essays are  VERY important.  We are sure that our daughter got in to two excellent  schools on the strength of her essays -- and indeed an admission officer  from one of those schools specifically told her that after she was  accepted.  And do whatever you can to get an interview.  We have no  scientific proof, but it is simply human nature to feel more enthusiastic  about a real person whom you have met than a mere bunch of papers.  The  schools our daughter got in to were all ones where she interviewed.  The  waiting list school was one where she did not interview.  Draw your own  conclusions.  <br />Good luck.  We'll revisit all of this when our next child  starts the process in a couple of years.
It is very difficult to write a persuasive review of this book.  The American people seem to have polarized on the Clintons.  Perhaps one-third think the Clintons are the most corrupt figures in generations, surpassing  even the Harding administration.  Perhaps one-third believe either that the  Clintons are great idealists who have done a wonderful job, or that they  should be defended because the opposition is even worse.  Probably at least  one-third are sick of the whole business and don't want to hear about it  any more.  Still, there have been so many books published about Bill and  Hillary that it is hard to escape notice.<br />Peggy Noonan has written a book  that is at once polite, respectful, contemptuous, articulate, too cute,  insightful, banal, penetrating, and boring.  How could a gifted writer like  Noonan pull off such a contradiction?  I think it is because she is trying  so hard to give Hillary credit where it is due (which Noonan does give  generously) while also trying to tone down her contempt (which is barely  disguised).  In a sense this book is an open letter to the voters of New  York to put a halt to Clintonism.  Yet it is written in a style that would  appeal more to readers of The New Yorker than to readers of The New York  Post or New York Daily News.  It seems to me that the readers who could  appreciate the style are already mostly in the Hillary camp.  <br />When my  wife and I first saw Bill Clinton in the 1992 Presidential debates we  thought him to be an \\"As-If\\" personality.  This is a personality  configuration in which an individual has no real core identity, but instead  acts \\"as-if.\\"  As if he really believed what he said, as if he were truly  compassionate, as if he were actually brave, etc.  It seemed to us that  Bill Clinton's strength and weakness was simultaneously that he loved the  political process yet had no core convictions other than winning.  In a  sense this can be good in that it can lead to flexibility and pragmatism.   It can also be bad if it turns a leader into a chameleon.  If you have no  true core self then you must rely on polls to tell you what will win.  If  you are extremely gifted as a chameleon you can believe your own deceptions  and this lie with total conviction.<br />Compared with other books about  Hillary Clinton, Noonan's book is rather mild.  Gail Sheehey's book is  riddled with even more psychologizing than Noonan's.  Barbara Olson's is a  more stinging indictment.  Actually, Noonan's psychological references are  quite strong, and one of the best chapters is the one in which she quotes  the great psychoanalyst Otto Kernberg on the subject of pathological  narcissism.<br />Reading the other previous reviews convinces me that America  is irrevocably divided on the Clintons.  Perhaps future historians, even  when armed with data that has been held back thus far from public view, may  also remain divided.  <br />The book ends on a poignant note.  Noonan states  that the voters of New York will decide about Hillary's future before  Hillary gets to decide their future.  Given the constant high ratings of  the Clintons I was left with the feeling that Hillary will get the last  laugh. <br />Finally, this is the only review I have ever written anonymously.   Considering it is about the Clintons, you can figure out why.
Rabbi Telushkin has done it again.  Already the premier author of a collection of books that amount to desk encyclopedias of Jewish Humor, Jewish Wisdom, Jewish Literacy, and Biblical Literacy, Joseph Telushkin now  adds this wonderful volume on practical ethics.  The book presents ethical  issues - one for each of six days with a time to review on the Sabbath -  that weave current and historical illustrations of important ethical  principles.  What distinguishes this \\"day at a time\\" ethical compendium  from others like it is the strength of the stories which illustrate each  principle.  These are deep and complex practical applications, neither  contrived nor saccharine.<br />Readers who are not Jewish will also be  interested in this book.  The lessons here are not related to any  particular sectarian view but apply to all those who feel that a religious  life must be an ethical life if it is to be meaningful and authentic.   <br />The publishers are to be commended on the beautiful presentation of this  book.  It should grace the shelves of anyone who wants a realistic guide to  a more ethical life.
What can I add to the praise the Harry Potter books have deservedly received?  Though they are a hybrid of previous generations of children's classics, they are more than wonderful.  In particular they give a vivid  picture of what a REAL boy would do in Harry's situation.<br />What moved me  to write this review is the reaction of my daughter.  Reading has always  been a chore for her, with her dyslexia variant.  It is fair to say that  until Harry Potter she never read for pleasure.  After being forced to read  the first few chapters she began to really get into it.  What a pleasure to  see your child devouring a book -- even staying up late to finish it.  She  is eagerly plowing through book 3 after having set herself the task of  reading at least two chapters per night of the first 2 books until she  finished.  Maybe you too will be able to ignite a love of reading in your  reluctant reader.  I hope so.  Thanks.
Only some sloppy editing and some repeatitive writing kept this from getting 5 stars. The ideas are electrifying. Tiger's basic theses are summarized in the Amazon and Publisher's reviews. Briefly, some of the  highlights are --<br />&quot;Who would have predicted that the introduction of  female contraception would be followed by an INCREASE in abortions and an  INCREASE in single mothers?&quot;  &quot;Who would have predicted that  women would outnumber men in college 55 to 45 percent?&quot;<br />&quot;Who  would have thought that women would be in the majority in graduate schools,  and at the 50% in medical schools?&quot;<br />&quot;Is the rise in male  homosexuality in any way related to femanism?&quot;<br />&quot;Are there fewer  reasons today for women to marry than there were a generation  ago?&quot;<br />&quot;Is the birth control pill (and the hormonal changes it  brings about) partly responsible for the trend toward more revealing  fashions?&quot;<br />&quot;What will become of males who are not connected  with families and children? Will humans revert to the more basic mammalian  pattern of mother-child units disconnected from bachelor hordes of  males?&quot;<br />&quot;What will be the long term consequences for male  children raised in the absense of fathers connected to the family  units?&quot;<br />These are some of the issues Lionel Tiger ties together in  an elegant and layered argument. <br />Though he sometimes obscures his  points, perhaps for protection in the university &quot;jungle,&quot; this  book merits a careful reading. It has certainly been one of the two or  three most influential books I have read this year. His discussion of the  power of biology to over-rule the power of politics will force the reader  to rethink many basic assumptions. Highly recommended.<br />PS Is it a sign of  the times that this distinguished scientist had his manuscript published by  Golden Books? Did the other major publishing houses find it too hot to  handle?
It must have taken a lot of courage for David Wienir and his contributors to bare their stories before the eyes of their fellow students and administration at Boalt Hall.  You can read it in the writing style  contained in these essays.  Many of the students are tentative, defensive,  overly careful in their prose and in their choice of words.  It is possible  to infer much anguish in the authors of these chapters.<br />Recently there  have been some exposes of the direction our elite universities have taken.   The Shadow University, by Kors and Silverglate; The Killing of History, by  Windschuttle; Beyond All Reason, by Farber and Sherry; Literature Lost, by  Ellis; and Fashionable Nonsense, by Sokal and Bricmont each seeks to expose  the destructive trends of thought control in places formerly dedicated to  the pursuit of truth above that of political correctness.  David Wienir's  book is the first account I know of coming directly from the students'  point of view.  As such it presents a tragic picture of the decline of a  once great institution.<br />I was an undergraduate at Berkeley during the  early sixties.  What the students fought for in those heady days is a  bygone dream overtaken by anti-intellectual tactics.  Read the reviews in  Amazon carefully.  And read this book to decide for yourself.
Getting your kid into a good college is a nerve-racking process for most parents.  It certainly has been for us.  We have found the customer reviews in Amazon very helpful.  That prompts us to distill our ratings of the  various guidebooks.  <br />The best short reference on each college is the  Princeton Review of The Best (311) Colleges.  It gives ratings of academic  quality, difficulty of admission, percentage admitted, etc.  There is also  a brief summary of college life and what each place might be looking for.   <br />Peterson Guide is comprehensive, and has long write-ups for each school.   There is a front section for each school, listed alphabetically within  each state, and a back section with detailed profiles of selected  institutions.  <br />Fiske's guide is interesting, but he basically has  something good to say for each school, so careful reading between the lines  and for \\"damning with faint praise\\" is called for.<br />The Yale Insider's  Guide is extremely subjective, with different students writing various  reviews.  We did not find it too reliable, except in conjunction with other  books.<br />Likewise for Barrron's Guide to the Most Competitive Colleges.   Recent alumni write of their (invariably positive) experiences.  Take it  with a grain of salt, or read carefully between the lines.<br />Choosing the  Right College by ISN was extremely helpful.  Some readers criticized it for  being allegedly right wing.  We did not find it so.  Rather, knowing the  point of view of the authors helped us evaluate their observations.  Other  books do not make their biases explicit.  A feature of the book we found  particularly helpful was the naming of excellent professors and departments  in each college.<br />Antonoff's College Finder was interesting only in  conjunction with other books.<br />Three books written from the perspective of  college admissions officers were very interesting and helpful.  They are  The College Admissions Mystique, by Mayher, Getting In, by Bill Paul, and  most of all A is for Admission by Michelle Hernandez.  We strongly  recommend that parents and the kids who are the applicants read at least  one of these.<br />Another very helpful book was You're Gonna Love This  College Guide, by Marty Nemko.  It takes the student through the decision  process of big vs. small, urban vs. country, elite vs. the level just  below, geography, and so forth.  That really got our daughter unstuck in  her thinking process.<br />Loren Pope is another helpful author for those who  think that not getting into Harvard is the end of the world.  <br />Three  books we did not find to be particularly helpful are Getting Into Any  College, by Jim Good and Lisa Lee, The National Review College Guide, by  Charles Sykes and Brad Miner (too out of date), and The Real Freshman  Handbook, by Jennifer Hanson.  <br />One book we found to be unexpectedly  useful was Getting Into Medical School Today, by Scott Plantz, et. al.   Even if your child is not interested in medical school, this book puts  college in perspective for any post-college program.  <br />We hope readers  find our review helpful.

This is a wonderful book.  It starts with the question of whether we are fundamentally different from chimpanzies in the way our mind works.  Taking the perspective of an archaeologist, and blending that with the views of evolutionary biology and of human developmental psychology and cognitive science, Mithen spins an extroadinary tale. The earliest and most primative primates probably had most of their cognitive world &quot;hard-wired.&quot;  They had all the specific knowledge they needed for survival.  Primates really took off from the rest of the mammals when we developed &quot;general intelligence,&quot; which could learn from trial and error, and which could make generalizations based on experience.  However, this general intelligence was slow in acquiring new knowledge.  To accomplish that, specialized intelligences, or programs, needed to evolve.    The first of these was social intelligence, which was the specialized ability to read and understand social heirarchies.  Early empathy and the ability to infer from your own experience what other members of your species were thinking and feeling was the greatest power this new intelligence conferred, and became the origin of consciousness.  The second specialized intelligence was that of natural biology.  This was very helpful in expanding our observations of the world, and increased the food sources which were available to primitive ancestors of homo sapiens.  The third specialized intelligence was technical intelligence.  This enabled early man to fashion tools and to use them in ever more complex ways.    To these three intelligences -- psychology, biology, and physics, so to speak -- was added linguistic intelligence.  This gave the conscious mind a voice.  It also enhanced the other three intelligences, especially social intelligence.  Prior to the evolution of linguistic intelligence, peer communication was mostly visual and tactile.  Speech was much more efficient than grooming in building and maintainingsocial bonds.  It was also linguistic intelligence that made possible the next great leap to meta-intelligence.  Linking the four specialized intelligences, there evolved during the period leading up to 40,000 years ago, a supraordinate intelligence which permitted what we might now call multitasking, or integration among the other specialized intelligences.  We see the first evidence of this in the bursting forth of art and religion at that time.  None of these appear to have been present prior to that time.    Much like a simple computer, the earliest primates had a set of basic information.  Then came a generalized processor.  To this were added specialized programs for psychology, biology, physics, and language.  Finally, true homo sapiens developed a metaprogram linking the others and permitting genuine creativity to take off.  Unlike most popular books on science for the educated layperson, Mithen does not go in for much chit chat.  This is a pet peave of mine in other books, such as &quot;Sex on the Brain,&quot; or &quot;Why We Age.&quot;  Too much irrelevant material on the appearance and personal quirks of the scientists and not enough of the science.  Not so here.  The writing is only a tiny bit repetitious, and is generally excellent.  A few other brief notes.  Mithen explains some of the subtler aspects of upright posture, such as taking less direct sun, which permits foraging in the middle of the day.  He addresses the role of a meat diet compared to a vegetarian one.  He also demonstrates conclusively that while chimps and other primates have certain things in common with us, human intelligence is truly a unique phenomenon.
Latest in the series of encyclopedic works by America's best known author of such books.  Rabbi Joseph Telushkin takes us on a journey through the entire Hebrew Bible (Old Testament) to recount the best known and also some of the more obscure events and characters.  In his successful brief essay format, Telushkin offers the essence of Biblical narrative in a style accessible to all.
If you want to know why the American revolution turned out so much better than the hundreds of revolutions elsewhere during the past two centuries, this book is the place to start.  George Washington was the outstanding leader who won the war and started what might have been a fragile democracy in a strong direction.  Washington combined the virtues of courage, conviction, and restraint.  He attained these virtues through profound self-discipline which was culled from the wisdom of ages past. Revisionist  historians debunk our founders today, and romantic historians prefer Lincoln to Washington, if they have anything good at all to say about America and its leaders. After reading this wonderful book you will put Washington into 1st place.  The first half of the book is spellbinding.  The second half flags a bit, but not to the overall detriment of my enthusiastic recommendation.  I wish every eleventh grader was required to read this excellent volume.
This is an outstanding example of inspiration without the saccharine that afflicts most inspiring books today.  Professor Gelernter survived the nearly fatal attack by the unabomber through gallantry, the ability to find something to be grateful for even in the midst of tragedy, and the support of his family, his friends, and his faith.  He has shed nearly all of his bitterness, and his story is a text for recovery from tragedy.  It is more than that, though.  It is also in the tradition of authors like George Steiner, seeking to diagnose the ills of a society in which, using Gelernter's own words, the twentieth century has become itself a crime scene.  Gelernter writes sparsely and bluntly about the transformation which has taken place in America since the 1960's.  Traditions and restraints have been broken, and putting things back together will take a long time and a lot of perseverence.  We have spent our grandparents' moral capital and have surrendered traditional values to the new intelligensia.  Whether you accept all of Gelernter's social criticism or not, you must read the book for the stirring recitation of recovery which rejected victimization in favor of redemption.  The tale of a gallant and noble soul.
This book should be of interest to both Jews and Christians.  It follows the life of Elishia Ben Abouya, a brilliant young rabbi who lived in the first century of the common era.  Based on accounts reported in the Talmud, this book contains Steinberg's imaginative and sensitive depiction of a time strangely like our own, in which the stresses and strains between the secular world and old and new religion play themselves out.  Jews will find many of their rabbinic heroes portrayed -- such as Rabbi Akiba and Rabbi Meir.  Christians will be fascinated by the tensions between the Hebrew Christians and the Gentile Christians of the first century.  Particularly moving is Steinberg's elaboration of Ben Abouya's reaction to the deaths of Meir's children, a story also based on talmudic writings. This is historical fiction at its best.  A classic.  Very highly recommended.
Daniel Matt has written a book attempting to integrate modern physics and ancient theology.  For his effort he comes up with a 20th century quantum version of deism -- the view that God started the universe and then walked away, leaving the clock (or the waves and particles) to fend for themselves.  The trouble is that such a universe and such a God have nothing to say about ethics and even less to say about the practices we should engage in to enoble and sanctify our lives.  What we are left with is a cold theology which sees God in energy and in matter, but not in the soul.  Such a God is literally &quot;no-thing.&quot;  For a better attempt at a similar synthesis I would refer readers to Lawrence Kushner's &quot;The River of Light.&quot;
For the reader looking for a summary of Western philosophy there are only two outstanding choices -- Bertrand Russell's one volume history and the five volume series by Jones.  I prefer Jones' because of his clear writing, the integration of philosophy with the culture and political events of the era, and the outline style in which he presents his ideas.  I used the first edition as an undergraduate philosophy major.  I have enjoyed reading the second edition several decades later to wipe away the cobwebs of my memory and to reacquaint myself with the greatest thinkers of our culture.  Highly recommended to philosophy students and to general readers.
Soloveitchik published only a few titles during his long life as the leading Orthodox rabbi of this century.  This is the one new readers should start with.  It is rather difficult, and for some a dictionary may be needed, but its rewards far surpass its difficulties.  Soloveitchik's thesis is that there are two stories of creation in the Bible, not because there are two literary traditions, but because there are two sides to man.  Majestic Adam sees God in the splendor of the universe, and shows reverence through science.  Lonely Adam craves a personal relationship with God, which is glimpsed in fleeting moments.  Soloveitchik has no use for cheap &quot;spirituality.&quot;  His is the real kind, which takes deep thought and a lot of work.  His is also the kind which, once attained, lasts a lifetime.
There have been many books of this genre lately, but this is by far the best written.  In four dozen short, free associational essays, Kushner addresses many of the deeper issues of life.  If you are looking for an accessible way of thinking about the problem of evil, the dilemma of closeness and letting go, the issue of meaning within apparent chaos, this is the book to read.  Some will want to go to deeper and more challenging books after this one.  For those who like dessert before the main course, Kushner is the choice.
Telushkin has a distinguished record as an encyclopedist.  This book is more ambitious in that it integrates his source material into a coherent thesis: that words are powerful ways in which we can hurt each other if we are not careful.  One of his most useful insights is in illustrating how even true information can be used as a weapon.  On a macro level, his advice would be welcome in the public arena.  On a micro level, this book should be read by every parent and every lover and friend.  Sticks and stones can break your bones, and words can sting for years if we don't use them wisely.
Paul Johnson is one of my favorite authors and thinkers.  In this masterful book he sets forth the antecedents of our present condition.  His explanation of World War I made it clear for the first time.  His story of World War II was riviting and written like a novel.  His two greatest achievements in this book are the way he exposes the falsities of the fifties and sixties, especially with regard to the &quot;third world,&quot; and in his persuasive view that the actions of heroic or foolish individuals have more of an effect than the &quot;impersonal forces of history.&quot;  Anyone who wants to understand today must read this volume.
