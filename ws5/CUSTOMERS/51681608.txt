I love this book.  It really helps to put things in focus.  How do you weigh the importance of family time with business time?  Mr. Hickman is a gifted speaker and a great writer who kindly shares some of his experiences.  You won't be able to put his book down.  I've loaned my copy to my mother who passed it on to my father, who's passed it on to one of his friends, etc.  I guess I'll have to buy another copy! :)
This book is great.  The guy who gave it 2 stars is misguided.  The bits in this book are priceless.  There are several bar bets, stunts, gambling advice and cons.  The best part is that it is such a fun read.  Definitely read this book some day before you die!!
The guy who gave this 1-star must of been having a bad day.  This handsome 9 volume set is one of my most prized possessions.  You'll find the entire canon, logically broken up into several books.  It's the complete original  Conan Doyle stories, they're classics, they're Sherlock!

This is a classic expose dating back to 1584.  Thanks to the author many named witches were spared from being burned at the stake!  The author reveals the secrets of so-called witches and explains their supernatural  powers as being nothing more than conjuring tricks.  If you like magic, or  reading about the history of magic then this book is a must have. -Diamond  Jim Tyler
This book is a classic of magic.  Anyone interested in doing magic with ropes must have this book.  It's nearly 400 pages are packed full with just about everything a magician can do with a rope; penetrations, restorations,  false knots, you name it.  It's a small price to pay for this wealth of  knowledge. -Diamond Jim Tyler
What else can I say?  This book contains the real mechanics used by professional card handlers.  The author's true name is not known because he knew that exposing these secrets could be detrimental to his health.  Most  of the material within is knuckle-busting, but worth your time if you would  like to know how card cheats do what they do. -Diamond Jim Tyler
