I am a mom to 5 boys and our family has been hooked on the adventures of the Sugar Creek Gang for a few years now! We originally discovered the stories through an awesome set of cassette tapes. The books were dramatized for an radio series by Paul Ramseyer of Northwestern College Radio in Minnesota and our family is now a part of the ministry, helping to produce the audio series for families to enjoy at home! Do you want your children to learn gentle lessons of courage, faith & friendship on THEIR level? Do you want to see real growth in their character? The stories are fun adventures with the truth of God's plans woven skillfully throughout. See the world through the eyes of Bill Collins, a freckle-faced, firey-tempered red head. You'll enjoy Bill's antics and the barefoot fun of all the boys in the \\"gang\\"! (As a side note, I do recommend the books be read in order. They tell an ongoing story from beginning to end.) From the back of the tapes: \\"Step back in time... to one-room schoolhouses, hot summer days of fishing, fun and barefoot boys. Sugar Creek Gang stories engage the imagination and draw a child's heart into a living relationship with God! Hymns, scripture verses, nature lore, poetry; sensitivity toward the disabled, the oppressed... and the courage and confidence to share the good news of salvation through Jesus Christ.\\" --- Just the right recipe for training up a child!

You may think a Richard Scarry book is simply written, but these \\"adapted\\" books are a disgrace to the original author's flair for the written word.  I wish the publishers would be truthful about who is paid to author these wimpy adaptations.  Bring back the ORIGINAL books and burn these imitators!!
Need a heart-warming book for a quick family read-aloud night?  If you appreciate the wholesome literature of the 1930's - 1960's, you'll enjoy this simple story.  There is a reason it was a Newbery award-winning book!  Books don't win these awards without meriting them.  The previous reviewer is narrowminded if he/she can't see any value in this story.  Why must everything in today's libraries be sooooo \\"politically correct\\"?  I'd like to think our children are intelligent enough to understand how historical writing has changed over time.  Fifty years from now you'll be able to pick out today's \\"new\\" literature for being so pretentiously biased.  The Courage of Sarah Noble will still remain a classic, regardless.
Calling all NASA fans! We had this book handy the day the International Space Station was in the news... one of over 150 titles in the \\"Let's Read-and-Find-Out Science\\" series that we own and use constantly! Begun in the 1960s, this series is just perfect when you want to explore a specific topic. Books about the different phases of the moon, the ways of ants, ladybugs, gravity, your skeleton.... all kinds of timeless books with timeless information presented in a living way! But what about the books about rockets and sattelites? Boy, are they outdated! That is why I was so delighted with this great new title. Generous oversized format with LOTS of detail.
Share in this Southern swamp excursion with Jim and Deanna Arnosky..... and you will feel as if you are really there with them, invited along as a personal friend! Jim's paintings take you deep into the mysteries of the swamps, with tips about how to spot wildlife & information about their habitats. The author is an acclaimed artist and naturalist... and sketching lessons are even included! Wild and Swampy is an example of fine living literature which will lead the whole family into the exploration of natural science, observation & art. Arnosky's books are highly recommended!
For any family who's ever experienced the joyful expectation of a newborn baby.... with all the hope and promise for the child's life.... there are 2 titles by Rebecca Bond that are SURE to please! The warm illustrations.... rooms full of books (and no TVs!).... and the tender multi-generational love for new life --- it doesn't get any better than this! JUST LIKE A BABY and BRAVO MAURICE by Rebecca Bond are the perfect \\"snuggle up and read-to-me\\" books. A word of advice: Your budding artists will want to duplicate the bright colors, textures and patterns.... Bond's art is contagious, so have the crayons, paper & paints ready!
I cannot read this book without crying! It is a touching story of a Mother's love and generosity... and a daughter's sacrifice which is truly rewarded with something that money can't buy. The miracle worked with Mama's hands is breathtaking! Mama's Way will bless you and give you a beautiful tool to reach into your child's heart and talk about things like self-sacrificing love & frugality. The sunny watercolor illustrations will create a picture in your heart that you will never forget.
With the loving support of her mother, and the admonition of her deceased father to perservere in her quest for \\"curiosities\\", Mary Anning went on to discover ancient fossils which earned her the friendship and respect of many well-known scientists of the early 1800s. Christians and Jews will want to change the reference \\"millions of years\\" to \\"thousands\\" to be in keeping with Biblical creationism, but other than that it is a great book. It is the kind of book a young scientist will read again and again... feeling the cold, salty air as Mary digs in the sand and scrapes at the stones that fall from the cliffs of the shores of Lyme Regis, England. Her relentless curiosity and faithful endurance led to her discovery of what we now call an ichthyosaur... at the age of only eleven!
