Will Eisner is the only comic book artist to ever have his work shown in a museum of art.  His most important work is the Spirit.  The Spirit Archives series has brought together all of his work, that was printed in a weekly newspaper insert.  However, after the work found in volumes 1 and 2, Eisner was called to active duty and served in the army during World War II.  The Spirit carried on, but it was drawn by other artists.  Eisner's work does not pick up again until the stories found in Volume 12 of the Archives series.  The work in Volumes 3-11 is fine, but it is not the work of Will Eisner.
