Psychic Gifts in the Christian Life by Tiffany Snow (tools and training to access our God-Spots for  supernatural gifts, has great stories about healing, afterlife, NDEs, helping FBI on 9-11, etc)<BR>3. The Creative Habit: Learn It and Use It for Life by Twyla Tharp (helps to ease the fears of facing a blank beginning and opening the mind to new possibilities)<BR>4. The Power of Now by Eckhart Tolle (accessing the deepest self by living in the present time)<BR>5. 500 Low-Carb Recipes by Dana Carpender (actually good tasting recipes that will help you keep your physical balance, at least after the holidays!)

I also placed this particular review  under one of the books I have read and appreciated.<BR>1. The Five People You Meet in Heaven by Mitch Albom (how even the little things we do can affect changes in people's lives, and by doing them, affects ours too)<BR>2. Psychic Gifts in the Christian Life by Tiffany Snow (tools and training to access our God-Spots for  supernatural gifts, has great stories about healing, afterlife, NDEs, helping FBI on 9-11, etc)<BR>3. The Creative Habit: Learn It and Use It for Life by Twyla Tharp (helps to ease the fears of facing a blank beginning and opening the mind to new possibilities)<BR>4. The Power of Now by Eckhart Tolle (accessing the deepest self by living in the present time)<BR>5. 500 Low-Carb Recipes by Dana Carpender (actually good tasting recipes that will help you keep your physical balance, at least after the holidays!)
This time of year is the perfect time to look over the past 12 months and ask ourselves, did I do something that really count? Did I grow spiritually, spending time in reading and stimulating conversations, continuing to answer the questions that really matter? Did I share what I knew with others, to encourage and promote love and understanding? If your answer is one where you wish to do more, jumpstart your personal advancement this year by reading this book!  <br />The author captures the reader very well, and my excitement compelled me to finish this book within a few days. I live in the San Diego area, and would invite you to also read the books of three local authors, all of which I have heard at various speaking engagements, and were extremely impressed with, and subsequently bought their books. If you haven't read their books this past year, I would recommend them for your New Year, to help create a new, more powerful and intuitive New You in 2004:<BR> <BR>- Deepak Chopra: The Spontaneous Fulfilment of Desire <BR>- Jack Canfield/ Mark Hansen: Chicken Soup for the Soul: Living Your Dreams (Not Local, but excellent, uplifting stories)<BR>- Tiffany Snow: Psychic Gifts in the Christian Life - Tools to Connect<BR>- Marie Jones: Looking for God in All the Wrong Places
If you have ever wondered about people who die quickly - if they &quot;go to the light&quot; or wait around as ghosts for a while, and how we can help them transition, you may want to read Tiffany Snow's Psychic Gifts in the Christian Life - Tools to Connect. She has a personal experience in her book about 9-11, and how she ended up out-of-body to help 5 people on the plane transition successfully. She explains that victims who die quickly are often in shock, and don't really know that they are dead - they think \\"the angel and relatives that show up to escort them, are the dream, and not the reality.\\" During her time of &quot;reliving and relieving&quot; the last few moments before impact with each of the five, she was able to see the terrorists, what they were wearing and doing, etc, and the next day sent sketches and information to the FBI...and their unexpected, positive response. Much good is in this book about &quot;the other side,&quot; and I just wanted to pass on the info, it was interesting to me, and comforting, and especially for the victim's families, might fill in a few of the gaps.
