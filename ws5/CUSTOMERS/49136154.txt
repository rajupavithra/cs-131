If you like real life themes than this is for you.  Martin does makes you feel like you are reading our world history, were the &quot;good guys&quot; aren't always good and the &quot;bad guys&quot; aren't always bad.  People say tolkien is the best, but I have to disagree.  He is certainly the MOST important of all the fantasy writers because he showed everyone how it is to be done, but I found his stories wanting, and a little boring, almost kiddy like.  And I certainly don't love his characters.  His books are for children, Martin writes for adults. For me,  I like the sense of reality, which isn't always nice and clean, but mostly grim and grey.  I would say that tolkien is on the &quot;nice&quot; end of the spectrum and Martin is on the &quot;not so nice&quot; end of the spectrum in terms of violence and adult like themes. (Robert Jordan kind of fits right in the middle there and he is a great writer also!!) If you like for all the &quot;good charecters&quot; to live happily ever efter than this is not for you.   But if you like suspense and a heart pumping thriller, than start with book 1, A Game Of Thrones, and be drawn into martin's world....!!!!!
