I agree with a number of other reviewers that this series has stretched on way past where it should have stopped. The original Left Behind novel started off well, but it seems the length of the series was stretched by publishers who wanted to make as much money as possible and cash in on the series. I see no reason why &quot;The Indwelling&quot; and &quot;Assassins&quot; couldn't have been merged into a single book. A lot of what the authors put forward in the later books in the series is rehashed in previous books, like a television soap opera with Monday and Friday shows that mirror each other. Those still interested in reading well-written realistic scenarios of the apocalypse should read The Christ Clone Trilogy and Conquest of Paradise instead. Both those books were a lot more believable, and they didn't need twelve books to tell a good story about the Tribulation!
