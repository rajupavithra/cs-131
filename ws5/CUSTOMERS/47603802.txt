I bought this entire New Testament series commentary to help me in teaching an adult Sunday School class.  I'm glad I did!  All of the books include a verse-by-verse description that is very helpful.  A teaching outline is included for each chapter, along with discussion questions and an area with a more deeper discussion of certain topics important to that chapter.<br />As a new teacher, I have found this series invaluable in preparing my lessons.  I think you'll like this one.
