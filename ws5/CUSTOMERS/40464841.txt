For so many years, a Christian's only real option to read quality Christian literature was to read the marevelous C.S. Lewis.  I feel blessed in the the last couple of years with the outpouring of quality literature now available.  What's more, the different books are all very different.  Left Behind is a wonderful introduction to the theology behind the End Times and a great series for all ages.  We All fall down is a great book for more mature, intellegent Christians who wsnt to explore the individual ramifications of the End Times and the one on one relationship of a man who has fallen away from God.  The Christ Clone Trilogy is a thrilling, Tom Clancey like look at these events, full of unexpected twists and turns.  I know some people like to argue the various merits of these books as compared to each other, but I think they are all worth reading and feel lucky to finally have such a wide variety of GREAT Christian literature available.
