You MUST have a copy of this book!  Gregg gives a clear and complete understanding of each of the predominant interpretations of Biblical prophesy in a simple and easy to use format!  You will want to read each section, and will no doubt use this as a handy reference!  Gregg manages to keep his personal bias out of the descriptions, and fairly presents each argument clearly so that one can gain a complete understanding of each.  You may not be able to choose among the different views, but you will have a thorough grasp of each to help guide you as you search other sources.  Though at this writing I can't say I have chosen to ascribe to either of those views, I have grown much as a result of my exposure to this excellent work!  Thank you Steve Gregg for helping me grow in my faith!
I'm going to apply this commentary for the entire Counterpoint Series published by Zondervan Publishing Company.  My compliments to that company for creating this series.  I initially purchased \\"Four Views on the Book of Revelation\\" but soon realized it was only one in a series.  I got so much out of that volume, that I decided to purchase the entire set to study and keep for reference.  My spiritual growth has been remarkable as a result.  Seminary students and professionals would probably enjoy this series, which seems geared for them.  But this series is also excellent for those college-educated laypeople who feel inclined to enhance their understanding of Christian theology.   That is, with one caveat: Buy a decent theological dictionary to refer to at first.  It probably won't get used much after about the third book you choose to read, but initially you will be need it to be confident of some of the terms used among advanced theologians.  Then, the Counterpoint series will give you a full understanding of many different concepts and concerns of the Christian faith which have been applicable from early on until the present.  I've learned a lot, and the only way I think I could do better is if I were enrolled in Seminary.  A list of all the titles I am aware of from this series is: <br /> <br />Are Miraculous Gifts for Today? <br />Five Views on Law and Gospel <br />Five Views on Sanctification <br />Four Views on Hell <br />Four Views on Salvation in a Pluralistic World <br />Four Views on the Book of Revelation <br />Three Views on Creation and Evolution <br />Three Views on the Millennium and Beyond <br />Three Views on the Rapture <br />Two Views on Women in Ministry

This is an interesting speculation, and rather fun in that regard, but somewhat tenuous in it's logical assumptions.  Many of the \\"connections\\" presented don't necessarily follow from the evidence presented.  Rather, they only \\"MIGHT\\" be possible.  No \\"maybe\\" ever made anything a \\"definite,\\" and the leap from the fact that Leonardo Da Vinci's name was found on an old list of names does not prove that it must logically follow that the list was comprised of heads of a group dedicated to preserving a secret about Christ:  That Jesus and Mary Magdalene were married and had offspring. <br /> Then the book makes or implies additional similar leaps of reason based on the assumption that if concepts can be imagined from evidences found, then the those concepts must be true.  This is an obvious logical fallacy. <br /> As a Christian I'm supposed to be offended by this sort of reading, but I'm not.  Even in the REMOTE possibility that the premise is true, I have one question:  SO WHAT?  Nothing herein would demonstrate that Jesus Christ was not the Messiah, only the \\"possibility\\" that Jesus the Christ occupied some human attributes that were not recorded heretofore.  But Christians have long known that Christ demonstrated a few occasional human frailties as a result of assuming human form.  (I.e.: Praying to the Father and requesting to be released from His duties in the Garden of Gethsemene just hours prior to his arrest.) <br /> My inclination is to think Baigent, Leigh, and Lincoln fell victim to the \\"group think\\" phenomena, and were each drawn to support speculations that didn't necessarily follow from the evidence at hand.  As a serious scientific or historic study, I give this book zero stars.  But as a fun \\"speculation\\" I have to give it at least two.  So I've compromised and given it one.

Never heard of Sutherland before, but then I realized this is published through a web publishing company, so I guess that's why.  I've read some better yarns, but I suppose I've read a lot more worse ones.  It's not a story for kids or the feint hearted, and in a couple places it has some graphic scenes of violence, but nothing too bad by modern standards I guess.  And in its defense, those graphic scenes are realistic for those who like that sort of thing.  It also has a couple adult scenes that get a bit racy like a romance novel, but never quite make it to erotic.  My main criticism is that one has to be in a mood for something that delves into the psyche, and uses a lot of imagery.  I didn't think most people are into all that psycho-spiritualism anymore, but maybe some still are.  I found the characters and dialogue believable though, and that seemed to redeem the book for its shortcomings.  I wanted light reading, but I felt compelled to give it a more intense concentration than I was in the mood to do.  But to a lot of readers I suppose that speaks well for the story, so maybe that's more complimentary than critical.  I think I'd have liked it better if I'd been in the mood for this sort of thing, so I'll give it four stars instead of three.
I Finally got around to reading this last installment in a much too long series.  I put off reviewing the Left Behind series until I had read the entire set.  That is a choice I regret now, because some people seem to act as though to criticize Left Behind is akin to challenging the Bible.  Personally, I don't' challenge the Bible, but I question many of the interpretations of it that people assert.  I don't think any of us has perfect understanding, but it appears Lahaye and Jenkins seem to think they do, or at least they fail to acknowledge that this series is only based on their interpretations of some prophetic aspects of the Bible, and that people may want to compare it with other interpretations in order to consider such things for themselves. <br /> For the first six or seven books,  the story is a fun read though a tad naive at times.  (For example, in an earlier volume, one of the main characters is a recent convert to Christianity, who finds himself in a war zone in the midst of a raging battle, and fearing for the welfare of his missing girlfriend.  I found it childishly silly that he mentally chastises himself over the fact that he almost said a bad word out of old habit.  This was incredibly unrealistic, and I think this sort of trivial concern epitomizes the commonly held but mistaken belief that Christians attain salvation by their \\"goodness\\".  Whether one is a Christian or not, as I admittedly am, a basic understanding of the faith holds that humans are saved by the grace of God, and not out of their goodness or \\"works\\".  Christ's biggest rivals were the Pharisees, and he often challenged them for their arrogant assertion of trivial rules of behavior.  Lahaye and Jenkins seem to want to promote the belief of traditional churches of today, which are prone to being like the Pharisees, and demand that adherents must exemplify \\"nice\\" Christians and exhibit only the traits that fit the stereotype.) <br /> The series does follow Biblical prophecy thoroughly, but one needs to remember that this is according to Lahaye's and Jenkins's Futurist interpretation, which differs radically from the Preterist, Historicist, or Idealist views.  In that light, the series has merely capitalized on the popular and trendier interpretation. (Futurist Pre-millenialism: That all Apocalyptic prophecy is to be fulfilled soon and the world will first be destroyed then Christ will come reign.) That interpretation is popularly prevalent today, and is probably the only one known to most people.  But the other views are equally valid and based on as much Scripture as the Futurist view.  They also have historical records to back them up.  (For more understanding on these interpretations, I recommend \\"Revelation: Four Views; A Parallel Commentary\\" by Steve Gregg.) <br /> The series is entertaining for the first few books, but the authors could have covered more ground and completed it in fewer installments.  I suspect they wanted to stretch it out to generate more revenues, and keep the hype up for the scads of spin-off products that flooded market shelves.  I could have forgiven a lot of shortcomings, but after the seventh installment I came to this conclusion and tended to resent it. <br /> As to this twelfth and final installment \\"Glorious Appearing,\\" I think most of the entire volume should have been an epilogue in an earlier installment.  I also think some of the imagined descriptions of the Millenial reign are once again naively lacking in their portrayal.  For instance, although humankind will have the same basic physical drives such as hunger for food, and will enjoy the available bounties, no mention is made about other physiological drives such as the libidinous ones.  Such an omission seems to imply that people will then have no sex drive.  I question how Lahaye and Jenkins can know this, and whether such things won't apply in that time.  Granted,  Christianity has a long history of advocating chastity, and the Jewish faith long before that.  But the vision portrayed by Glorious Appearing emulates the Garden of Eden in most respects, before the fall of mankind when many believe is the time when fornication became a sin.  Adam and Eve weren't worried about carried over Victorian attitudes or the injunctions of Saint Augustine, so why would the new Millenial Reign be different?  More naive silliness based on assumptions about \\"nice\\" Christians. <br /> Now that I've voiced my criticisms, I need to mention my primary compliment, which greatly outweighs all my negative opinions.  I think the fact that the series has exposed millions to the Faith and many have testified that it lead them to Christ, my above criticisms become minuscule in relative value.  Lahaye and Jenkins have performed a great service for Christ in that regard!  Whatever their motives or possible mistakes, (I say \\"possible\\" because I can't prove or disprove either way) they have helped spread the Gospel in a way that got through to many people who have lived in Christian societies, and some who were even practicing Christians, but had never truly learned about the Faith.  For that reason, and though I found the last volume to seem anti-climactic, I think the entire series is still very well worth reading.  I wish for that reason I could give it five stars, but the items above compel me to leave it with four.
