This book and its author have received many nasty reviews from otherwise evenheaded critics. I didn't want to read it, but I'm very happy I did. Seldom have I read a book that deals with the subjects of loss, loneliness, and bereftness with such an unflinching eye. This book will eventually be considered a classic. <br />
Outdated facts, arbitrary topics, and a false populist tone fill this careless guide. Have the authors read any scientific or medical journal published after the Victorian age?
You will find Jane Austen in high school classrooms, as inspiration for contemporary movies and fiction (Clueless, Bridget Jones' Diary), and at a book club or two. Otherwise, she is not part of us: Her laser-eyes, scathing commentary about society, and merciless fun at the expense of over-the-top piety are missing. In our current Press-Release era, where ads blanket our cities, and celebrities alter their image every other week, Jane would have a field day-- her observations would have been invaluable, her sharp humor liberating. <br />\\"Pride and Prejudice\\"-- the story of independent-minded Elizabeth Bennet's journey to a happy marriage and her rousing rebellion against the stultifying and stale social system of 19th-Century England-- is an adrenaline-rush of a book.<br />As Elizabeth battles the defenders of society (her marriage-obsessed mother, a condescending suitor, and several members of the \\"upper-class\\" trying to stem her promising relationship with the affluent and handsome Mr. Darcy) we sample a world where family, money, and class dictate your friends and suitors. <br />When Elizabeth and Darcy move to his stunning home, they leave the hostility of an uncaring society behind. Through rebellion and stubbornness, they have found Eden.

After a teenage girl is raped and murdered by a neighbor we follow her family, and other relevant characters (the murderer, lead investigator, high school friends), through the immediate aftermath and long term effects of her death. Our guide is the murdered girl herself, an intelligent and open-minded narrator called Susie Salmon. She is in heaven and able to follow the living liberally. <br />During most of the book, which takes place during the days, weeks, and months after the tragedy, Susie paints a harrowing portrait of how different community members cope.  Among those featured: The grieving father's coddling of his youngest son, the lead detective's sincere-- but clumsy-- investigation, and the murderer's glee and utter professionalism as he disposes the dead girl's body. We are also treated to a sweet depiction of Susie's heaven: it is tailored made for her and filled with<BR>favorite things from her days on earth. <br />Towards the end, the author looses her cool. Her editor must have been on vacation (there is no other explanation)  and, consequently,  we are treated to a glorious meltdown:<br /> * Susie's narration, which was engaging and true to a teenager,<BR>suddenly sounds as erudite as a graduate student consulting   with her dissertation adviser.  <BR> * Her knowledge of sexual facts (in practice and theory) would  make Dr. Ruth blush.<BR> * A high school friend mingles with Susie's spirit and, after<BR>graduating from high school, moves to New York, sports an all-black wardrobe, visits heaven (don't ask me how) and preaches to dead people about dying (don't ask me why, or how-- it's a surprise!)<br />I encourage everyone to read this book. It must have been impossible, after such a beguiling start, to find a resonant ending. My suggestion:<BR> <BR>Once the narrative starts jumping years stop reading and call it a book,otherwise be brave and trudge-on.
Mary Karr's memoir, about growing-up in a desolated Texas town under the care of alcoholic parents, should be read by anyone who is planning to start a family. The Liars' Club highlights the traits of a household ruled by alcohol: the sudden maturity young children must demonstrate, the outcast status these children have to deal with in the community, and the futility they feel as parents waste their parental and vocational gifts.<BR> <BR>Don't miss this extraordinary book. Mary Karr is a professor at Syracuse University, and a poet. No wonder, all characters feel real and are not a collection of tics and eccentricities which populate many current books. Her economical use of metaphors and similes keeps this memoir free of platitudes masquerading as life lessons. When the metaphors come they mean something. Mary Karr and her older sister are not portrayed as saintly or innocent: They are precocious, stubborn, and cynical.<br />When parents are unavailable, when children are forced to become de-facto parents, when the same children are repeatedly submitted to beatings and other punitive actions for no apparent reason, a skeptical soul may be the only road to adulthood.
I've never been to a race track and gambling is not for me.  I don't know the basics about horses and avoid equestrian articles in the sports section. Seabiscuit, however, takes us on a fascinating ride: We experience the great fire that demolished San Francisco, we have house seats during the battle between horses and cars for transportation supremacy (the parallels between the early days of cars and the current cell-phone age are unavoidable and unsettling), and we stroll the streets<BR>of Tijuana during its heyday a refuge from Prohibition.<BR> <BR>The protagonists are recognizably human and, in different ways, heroic. Even the moody and stubborn Seabiscuit is described with empathy. The narrative style is friendly and conversational, and the ending is unexpectedly moving.  <BR> <BR>Seabiscuit has presided over the New York Times Bestsellers List for a while now, and there are plans for a movie. Maybe the film version will be effective. But do yourself a favor, treat yourself to this extraordinary tale before your first impression of Seabiscuit is a compromised, one-step removed film version.
There are many story lines and narrative styles populating &quot;Everything is<BR>Illuminated&quot;. One of the threads--a series of letters and a narrative by a<BR> sensitive Ukrainian-- is at once moving and hilarious. <BR> <BR> Other narratives (which explore the history, myths, and development of a<BR> small village) are burdened with one-dimensional characters who experience<BR> supernatural occurrences-- these story-lines are an awkward mix of<BR> Gabriel Garcia Marquez's mythical communities and Isaac Bashevis Singer's<BR> old European tales. They read more like writing exercises than as<BR> necessary sections of this story. As the novel chugs along, the narratives<BR> mingle and Everything is Illuminated becomes addictive, shocking, and<BR> honest. <BR> <BR> Some novels never take a wrong step and are perfect combinations of<BR> addictive plots and previously undiscovered insights (The Stone Diaries, A<BR> Confederacy of Dunces, David Copperfield are a few). Everything is<BR> Illuminated is not a perfect book, but its good parts are great-- an<BR>exhausting emotional roller-coaster.
Imagine watching a remake of the hostage classic \\"Dog Day Afternoon\\" by the filmaking team Merchant/Ivory. \\"Bel Canto\\" presents a story which is at times a taut hostage drama, and at others an insighful meditation about community, love, and other forms of human relations.<br />Maybe some of the plot twist are farfetched, maybe the narrative slows to a crawl for a short-time before the emotional and action-packed finale. However, the characters have plenty of depth, the romantic sub-plots are moving, and all details are charmingly observed.
&quot;David Copperfield&quot; has everything: A captivating narrator, engaging-- and very human-- secondary characters,and deceitful villans.<br />Throughout, Dickens explores many issues with a liberty which is hard to associate with the Victorian age.<br />Copperfield's ruminations on friendship-- by means of his two best-friends Traddles and Steerforth -- develope as he ages.  His complicated thoughts about marriage are sorrowful. Even Copperfield's mother is presented with a realistic eye, and not idealized.<br />&quot;David Copperfield&quot; is over 700 pages. I wished it was longer.
With prose more sleep-inducing than general anesthesia, this tome (at least it feels long) microwaves managerial cliches until you wish to forgo a career in public service.  Avoid at all costs.
Using the over-used word &quot;creative&quot; as a shield, &quot;Tools for Innovators&quot; rehashes common-sense and stale ideas as exciting new methods for public managers. Current and aspiring managers should avoid this platitude-ridden guide: It will not improve your managerial skills, only waste time.
At the begining of this biography, Carol Shields warns us that not enought documents and recollections remain to paint a realistic picture of Jane Austen. <br />Ms. Shields employs her acute sense of empaphy-- gloriously exhibited  in &quot;The Stone Diaries&quot;-- to imagine the author behind &quot;Emma&quot; and &quot;Sense and Sensibility&quot;.  There is no way to confirm the veracity of Ms. Shields meditation, but it doesn't matter.<br />If the &quot;Jane Austen&quot; exhibited, in this enthralling member of the Penguin-Lipper &quot;Lives&quot; series, is a character who is purely Carol Shields' creation, she is fascinating: ironic, observant, and razor sharp.<br />In most books from the &quot;Lives&quot; series, the reader acquires not only an appretiation of the subject matter, but becomes familiar with the personality, open-minded analysis, and ethusiasm of the author. <br />Carol Shields is a terrific guide through Jane Austen's sensibilities and accomplishments.
Along with Carol Shields' &quot;Jane Austen&quot; and Douglas Brinkley's &quot;Rosa Parks&quot;, Du Plessix Gray's &quot;Simone Weil&quot; demonstrates three qualities that make the Penguin-Lives series unique and important:<br />1. gripping-- and friendly-- narrative style,<BR>2. vibrant guidance through historical times, and<BR>3. subjects that are infuratingly flawed but alter the course of history.  <br />As we trace Simone Weil's life we get a unique picture of France's situation during WW2. A brief sample: we travel south with the Weils as they flee Germany's invasion of France, spend time with the revels during the Spanish civil war, and receive an unflinching description of factory life in mid-century France.  <br />Furthermore, Du Plessix Gray's examination inspires conflicting feelings towards Weil. Sometimes I felt admiration for her intellectual bravery and exhaustive examination of dangerous factory life. At other times her fixation with masochistic actions, manipulation of friends, stubborn personality, and, worse of all, her rabid anti-semitism makes Simone Weil hard to take seriously.<br />This meditation of a short, but action-packed life, is a rewarding and thought-provoking read.
If you read &quot;Mrs.Dalloway&quot; with an eye to plot it will be slow and its greatness will remain obscure.<br />However, if a reader relaxes and lets herself enjoy the tender prose, and the emotional storm suffered by many characters(especially Septimus and his wife), Mrs. Dalloway will haunt the mind with its insights.<br />Furthermore, reading &quot;Mrs.Dalloway&quot; is great preparation for its inspired (and there I say superior) contemporary sequel,&quot;The Hours.&quot;
The revelations in this book, combined with a comforting empathy and confident prose, combine to make &quot;The Hours&quot; into an eye-clearing experience.<br />I've just finished it, and can't imagine concentrating on other works of fiction.<br />A truly seminal experience.
Founding Brothers casts the Revolutionary Generation as members of a wacky movie:<br />Jefferson is a scheming image-concious politician<br />Adams a motor-mouth drama king <br />Madison the ultimate cold-eyed master parlimentarian, and <br />Hamilton is a euphoric personality who wants to conquer the world.<br />This is an educational, and fun read.
The first and final quarters of this novel are an extraordinary comparative meditation of the infatuated love between two young people, and the realistic--more rewarding friendship-- between two older lovers.  Unfortunately, the middle section is slow and uninteresting. However, the lessons discovered at the end are worth some drudgery.
This is the greatest contemporary book I've ever read. It's a kaleidoscope of complicated characters, a bewildering city, and wisdom. While reading this book I found myself laughing-outloud and tearing-up simultaneously.
After witnessing the emotional honesty of The Right Thing, I was certain that Mr. Stoppard was going to produce a stirring and evocative examination about unrequited love. <br />Alas, all we get is dense language, hyperactive research, and intellectual self-admiration. To be avoided at all costs unless as a prescription for insomnia.
After the first-person adrenaline rush of &quot;The Mysteries of Pittsburg&quot; and &quot;Wonder Boys&quot;, Michael Chabon guns for the epic big-statement novel and the results are mixed. There are beautiful passages (the mute relationship between Clay and his muscle-man father)but overall the narrative seems dwarfed by the historical events this novel travels. As I read &quot;The Amazing Adventures of Kavalier and Clay&quot; I kept thinking about Martin Scorcese who abandoned the kinetic and unique style from &quot;Taxi Driver&quot; and &quot;Mean Streets&quot; to reach Oscar fame with &quot;The Age of Innocence&quot; and other spiritless movies.
&quot;Approaching Death&quot; belongs with &quot;How we Die&quot; and Bill Moyer's Milestone &quot;On Our Own Terms&quot; as the seminal studies on Dying. At times empathetic, scholarly, and broadminded. This treatise should be read by all of us.
This at times brilliant and heartfelt book is sabotaged by an unfortunate lack of editorial discipline. You will be moved to tears during some passages. At other times you will curse the day your eyes met this  never-ending discourse.
This heroic effort to describe every aspect of food is replete with concise information, smart essays on many topics, and a sharp sense of humor. You will not be able to put it down.
This outstanding book clarifies many freudian topics that remain obscure in less skillful hands. An opinionated and thorough discourse.
The strongest part about this smoothly written tale is its description of Manhattan as the seasons reveal their distinct personalities. Unfortunately, the people who populate this group border on stereotypes(  the ice queen, the shy accountant ready to blossom, the forceful therapist  with a deep secret)whose imminent struggles are predictable and  anti-climatic.
This book is a delight.  It provides so much information about spices and other cooking matters. Destined to become a classic.
The first third of this fast-paced book provides a keen study of psychotherapy and its stages.  The characters are engaging and true to life.  However, in the hurried action movie like ending all of the  characters lose their dimensions in a silly action-movie like sequence. We  are left with mixed messages, half-explored issues, and a nagging sensation  that the author lost his nerve and took the easy way out.
This beautifully written account of Ruth Reichl's warm relationship with food, is peppered with moving anectdotes about her mother and the education of one of the most influential food critics in modern times.   Unfortunately, the portraits of the most important men in her life( father,  husband) is sketchy and guarded.  Maybe now that Ms. Reichl doesn't have to  hide her identity anymore, she will write a second volume that is not as  muted.
With helpfull illustrations this book will satisfy your cooking curiosit
This hard to understand and self-indulgent meditation holds a lot of promise. However, the reader gets lost in a sticky world of SAT words and muddy thoughts as soon as he/she opens the book.  Good luck.
This beautifully laid-out book has interesting information about caviar, oysters, and other gourmet treats. I've learned a lot about, and gained respect, for many culinary creations that I previously knew very little  about.  However, it is also dispiriting. For example, I am now discouraged  from eating any American Oysters(according to Mr. Rosengarten, the only  good ones are from France), and his chapter on Pecan Pie, betrays a palate  that is maybe a little narrow and judgemental.  In short, althought very  informative, &quot;Taste&quot; left me with a bitter taste in my mouth.
This book makes you think, but it is so skillfully and beautifully written that it is without pretention.  It asks questions about writing and literature and art and life, but it is above all a page-turning mystery set  in New York City.  I always wanted to know what would happen next, but the  language was so beautiful that I was content no matter how much or how  little of the actions were actually explained.  I recommend this to all  mystery-lovers, all New Yorkers, and anyone who loves to read.  This book  may turn you into a bit of an existentialist, but it will do so with a  great sense of humor.
This is an excellent, well-written introduction to the world of wine
By focusing on the Ali-Liston battles, &quot;King of the World&quot; paints vivid and unforgettable portraits of not only Ali, but Liston and Patterson. This is a fun read, and the most memorable book on Boxing since  Thomas Hauser's book on the same topic.
