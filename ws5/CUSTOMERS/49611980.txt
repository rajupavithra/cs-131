I avoided this book for some time. I wasn't interested in anything with \\"stickers\\" for my young son. (I could just see them being attached to the wood furniture.) At some point we ended up with the book. I was shocked that the \\"stickers\\" were actually \\"colorforms\\", something that I had been looking for. The \\"stickers\\" are made of a thin plastic with the pictures printed on them. The \\"pages\\" of the book are made of a stiff board material.<br />Ironically I was looking for colorforms for my son. When I inquired at the local toy stores they all told me that Colorforms were no longer in production. &lt;sigh>
We purchased this series to help my oldest learn to read. His Kindergarten teacher had told us he would never learn to read. The books are simply written and maintain the same plot line through all the books. The main character is always &quot;Little (letter of the book.&quot; Each character has a box and decides to fill it with items that start with that letter. My oldest (now 8) reads on the 6th grade level with full comprehension. These books have done wonders in our house. I'm sorry to find that this series is now so hard to come by. I will definately hold on to these for my other children and then for their children.

Having Native American children I am always looking for books for them. I purchased this for my 18 month old (hard cover version). He loves to look at it. He will pull it out at least once a day to look at it. I've even noticed his 8 year old brother sneaking a peek more than once. I love the vibrant, without being bright, illustrations. They are intracate yet simple. The rabbits are adorable. The book starts with one rabbit and continues through to 10. The rabbits are in Native American regalia and doing traditional Native activites
This book is full of inaccurate statements and false information. Shortly after the book came out the books author announced that he is running for Congress. His district, if elected, would cover the \\"victim towns\\" in his book.<br />Most of the \\"sources\\" for this book either don't remember talking to the author or have publicly announced that their statements were changed in the book to reflect what the author wanted. A few of the \\"sources\\" have even gone to work for the Mashantuckets in an effort to clear their names from the lies told in this book.<br />My biggest problem with this book is that on page 372-373 the author lists the birth, marriage and death certificates for people most of whom are still living. It is my guess that he does this without their permission. This act in and of itself is illegal within the state of CT, as the vital records of living people are not supposed to public. But that does not seem to be a concern for this politician.<br />If you want a real book on the Mashantuckets than try another book.
