First I must say I started Painting miniatures in the late 80s, so it is not like I am new to this or that I am from the great old days of miniatures for war games before Gary and his friends creating D&amp;D.  And I have taken a few years off from purchasing miniatures.  But after buying some Partha miniatures from ironwindmetals and then these wotc I must say wotc has not impressed me.  While the plastic bases have never been my thing at least the parth ones made in the late 90s fit into their bases correct these wotc miniatures are either way to small or a few are so fat that I thought about getting out a grinder instead of a file.  While the flash was excessive on a few it really is easy to remove so I would not complain to wotc about it. But hear this wotc if you can't even ship a Mialee figure in the box like the art work on the back and the displacer beast comes cut in halves that don't come together even close and the ogre's arm won't fit into its socket and I get an extra nameless drow but no halfdragon mage to name just a few problems you need to fix something or you deserve less than one star!
