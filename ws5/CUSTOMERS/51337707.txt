I have to agree with Jeff Raft's review. This is the book I look to first and the only one I carry into the lab.  It rarely lets me down, but only for reference.  You will have a tough time learning from this if you are a beginner. The examples are very terse, but I like that.  I want one book with everything. <br />I bought Lippman's primer (3rd edition) as my first C++ book. Stroustrup was my second. I never ever use Lippman. It takes forever to read the giant examples, just to figure out what he is talking about. I have heard the 2nd edition was much better. <br />This book's index is excellent and Stroustrup cross refences sections through the book.  He will mention a concept related to what you are reading and then give you the section number to easily find it. I have learned a lot by following those leads.<br />I also have access to almost all of the Addison-Wesley STL books.  They are okay, but I still use this one first even for the STL.
