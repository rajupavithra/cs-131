The Gentle Art of Verbal Self-Defense was fantastic. Genderspeak is equally valuable. The book contains a useful metaphor between language traffic and automobile traffic. I finally realized the effect my language has on my physical health as well as the health of my relationships with others. This book is worth 10 years of therapy.<br />Because people cant immediately see the results of language traffic violations, they dont realize that theres a connection between their language behavior and the negative consequencesfor themselves as well as for othersthat only appear later.&quot;<br />&quot;Hostile language can kill you as surely as hostile driving can. The most serious risk factor for heart disease is chronic exposure to hostile language interactions. Hostile language hurts and frustrates and confuses people. It makes blood pressures soar and hearts pound and stomachs churn. It causes ulcers and strokes and migraines and depression. It makes people so flustered that they have dangerous accidents, in their homes and workplaces and in their cars. It can drive people to physical violence. All this is well known. The problem is thatunlike what happens when you run head-on into a speeding car in the wrong lanethe damage usually takes place slowly, over time, and the wounds arent readily visible. Its easy to see that violating the rules on the road is dangerous; its much harder to see the dangers when the space being shared is linguistic space.
I have read all of Virginia Lanier's books (date of review 8/7/00).  All  five are full of excitement and suspense as well as romance and humor.   <br />Being a dog lover myself, I was fascinated by the nuances of caring for,  training, and working with bloodhounds.<br />I just finished her last book in  the series and I will sorely miss Jo Beth and her adventures into the swamp  with her magnificent dogs.  I am eagerly awaiting the next one!

Janet Evanovich is definitely one of the wittiest authors I have ever read.  <br />Stephanie Plum is so down-to-earth and easy to identify with that I feel like I am reading about an old friend.  The book has just the right  balance between mystery, romance, and excitement.  I loved it.
Elvis Cole is a charming, sharp witted, wise-cracking private investigator who is teamed up with a Clint Eastwood type partner, Joe Pike.   <br />His novels are fast paced, and entertaining enough to make me laugh out loud.   <br />My favorite Elvis Cole novel is L. A. Requiem.  It focuses on Joe Pike.   Crais' writing is on a completely different level in this one.  I highly  recommend his books.  I have read all but his newest: Demolition Angel.  I  can't wait to read it!

Janet Evanovich is definitely one of the wittiest authors I have ever read.  <br />Her writing is so good that my husband and I fought over who got to read the book first.  (We both started reading it at the same time.)  I  finished it in one day.  I cannot get enough of her writing.  I hope she  writes a thousand more!<br />Leah L Higbe's comments on &quot;One for the  Money&quot; is a good review; she sums up everything I wanted to say.

I very much enjoyed this book.  The Dalai Lama explains some of the basic principles of Buddhism which I have been able to use in my own life.  I highly recommend this book to anyone who would like to see the world and themselves from a more relaxed, accepting perspective.
