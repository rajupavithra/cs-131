Clearly, my opinion is in the minority, but I didn't care much for this book.  I liked The Thief, although I wasn't crazy about the plot twist at the end.  However, I found this sequel to be a complete disappointment. <br /> <br />I hated the switch from first person to third person, since Gen's wiseacre voice was one of the things I enjoyed in The Thief.  I liked the lighter, funnier tone of the first book. <br /> <br />I found the relationships to be unbelievable in the extreme, particularly between Gen and the Queen.  I won't give away any plot points, but given what happens in the beginning, I found the end of the book particularly hard to swallow.  And while I really like characters who are neither completely good nor evil, I found these characters a bit schizophrenic -- acting one way at one moment, then pulling a complete character switch at the next. <br /> <br />Finally, I find the author's writing style hard to read and sometimes hard to follow.  She has a habit of \\"telling not showing\\" -- that is, describing what the characters are talking about rather than showing the actual conversation.  For me, that's a more boring style of writing.  It reminds me of a short story rather than a novel. <br /> <br />Just my opinion, since other readers apparently loved this book. <br />
To those who continue to write that the book is \\"boring\\"...well, you're not listening to us. <br /> <br />Do *not* read this book unless you love the Brontes, Jane Austen, Dickens, Thackery, etc. <br /> <br />Do *not* read this book merely because you love fantasy. <br /> <br />Read this because you love English literature.  It is beautifully written with absolutely wonderful characterization, and I expect it to win many awards.  I could quibble about a few minor issues, but any flaws are more than made up for by the excellent writing and realistic world. <br /> <br />You need patience to read this, and you need a deep love of reading.  Again, if you don't appreciate 19th English literature, don't attempt this. <br /> <br />As an aside, I just read that the film rights have been sold. <br /> <br />
I enjoyed this book and would actually give it 4 1/2 stars.  In the beginning, I felt it ranked as high as Harry Potter.  In the end, perhaps less so.<br />To me, these are the book's strengths:<BR>1.  Original setting in a modern-day London with magicians ruling the country.<BR>2.  Fun character in Bartimaeus and the other spirits.<BR>3.  Interesting setup between Nathaniel and Lovelace.  Interesting relationship between Nathaniel and Bartimaeus.<BR>4.  Good writing.  Funny asides by Bartimaeus.  Vivid and dramatic scenes.<br />And the weaknesses:<BR>1.  Bad magicians with no complexity or redeeming qualities.  Too one-dimensional sometimes.<BR>2.  A little schizophrenia on the part of Nathaniel and Bartimaeus.  One minute, they're cold and heartless.  The next, they're having a crisis of conscience and/or crying.  Bartimaeus is supposed to be a rather scary entity, but sometimes he's just pretty darn sweet.<BR>3.  Nathaniel gets lucky too often, especially at the end.  Basically, he wins through the incompetence of everyone else.  Sometimes, he doesn't deserve to win due to his pig-headedness and lack of common sense.<br />Having said that, though, it was a fun read that was hard to put down.  I would recommend it (and already have to several people) and plan to read the other books in the series.
Perhaps this was an overly ambitious subject -- I thought the book was swamped by it.  The premise is a terrific idea, but I didn't think the plot and characters were nearly as well-developed.  The lead character was vague and uninteresting to me, and the story was very slow-paced.  I found it easy to put down.  It struck me more as an &quot;important&quot; work than a fun one.<br />Also, I didn't care for the bad language and explicit sex.  The author was probably trying for a grittier feel in this book, but for me, it was still a turn-off.<br />Neil Gaiman is one of my favorite writers, particularly for prose, but this book was a disappointment to me.
I loved this book!  I'm an adult and I don't have kids, so I can't address whether or not it's child-appropriate, but I thought it was great.  It was charming, funny, different, fast-moving.<br />The fact that the hero was a criminal is what drew me to buy the book...to me, that made it interesting.  I couldn't wait to see which side was going to win.<br />It seems likely that this will be a new series.  If so, I look forward to reading the rest of the books.  This one was a blast!
I love fantasy and I love romance, and I love them mixed together, but this book is just plain silly.  I bought it, ...but couldn't get past the prologue.<br />In the prologue, a 14-year-old boy meets a girl his own age, and immediately decides that she is his soulmate, that she has a soul purer than anyone else on earth, and that he can no longer be happy except when he's by her side.  They consummate their love, amid much sighing and weeping and gazing joyously at the other person.  When the 14-year-old boy is not openly crying at the sight of his beloved, he's howling on the ground in torment. The emotions are that over the top.<br />To me, it reads like a ...Harlequin romance.  This first girl from the prologue (besides having the purest soul of any human being) is amazingly beautiful.  When I saw that the heroine was also going to be amazingly beautiful (with long, golden curls) and amazingly pure, I thought this is too much to wade through.  Especially given that it's part of a trilogy and given that there are so many other books to read.  Life's too short to read something so silly...
This is one of my all-time favorite books, science fiction or otherwise, along with its sequel, &quot;The Far Side of Evil.&quot;<br />I always wished the author had written more books in the series on Elana.  If it was her decision not to write any more, I wish she'd reconsider.  If it was the publisher's decision to end the series, they are missing the boat.
I was really drawn into the dark fantasy world of this book.  It reminded me of a grittier Neverwhere (which I also love).  I especially liked the animal superiors, and loved the character of King Rat.  Sometimes I was more sympathetic to him than to Saul, the main character.<br />I felt the ending was set up for a sequel, and really hope the author considers writing one.  I thought about this book for days after I finished it.  Fast read, lots of action, fun story.
I've read all the books in the Elements of Fiction Writing series and this is how I'd rank them.<br />&quot;Scene &amp; Structure&quot; &quot;Characters &amp; Viewpoint&quot; &quot;Beginnings, Middles &amp; Ends&quot;<br />The above three books are invaluable -- must reads.  They are the best of the series, in my opinion, and are packed with good information on every page.  Well-done.<br />&quot;Conflict, Action &amp; Suspense&quot; &quot;Description&quot; &quot;Plot&quot; &quot;Manuscript Submission&quot; &quot;Setting&quot;<br />The above five books are good, solid reads.  Again, they contain good information and cover the subject decently.<br />&quot;Voice &amp; Style&quot; &quot;Dialogue&quot;<br />To me, the last two books need to be rewritten.  They are by far the weakest of the series.  Both suffer from an annoying style, particularly Dialogue, and both are very skimpy on real information.  Neither one is very helpful.<br />This is the order in which I'd recommend reading them.

I don't know why this would be classified as Young Adult, except for the fact that it deals with the Robin Hood legend, and the fact that the author often writes YA books.  Primarily it tells the story of the Sheriff of Nottingham and his household, and the ways in which they change by interacting with Robin Hood.  The historical detail is impeccable, the characters very complex and completely in keeping with their time, and the relationships fascinating.  Enjoy it for the beautiful prose and character development.  A sophisticated gem of a book that deserves much wider readership.  I'm going to look for more by this author, including his modern YA books.
I was disappointed with this book, primarily because it deviated so far from the Biblical account.  In fact, there were so many deviations, some  relatively small, some major, that I had the feeling the author was trying  to write her own version, just for the sake of being different.  I wouldn't  expect this to be a Christian telling, of course, since the author is  Jewish, but this wasn't a Jewish version either.  As others have mentioned,  she emphasized paganism very heavily and implied that the God of the Bible  was only worshipped by males who were too stubborn to see the superiority  of the goddesses.  I was especially annoyed with Joseph's character who had  affairs with both Potiphar's wife and Potiphar, and was made rather nasty  at the end.  None of the women believed in God, and Jacob was supposedly an  idiot because he half-heartedly did, and because he believed he wrestled  with an angel and saw visions.<br />From a story point of view, I also got a  little tired of the menstruation and childbirth scenes.  I did think the  prose was well-done.  It just was a different story than I had in mind.<br />I  think that whether or not you enjoy the book might depend on your outlook.   If you think of the Biblical account as a myth and enjoy seeing it from a  different perspective, significantly changed, then you would like it.  If  your view is more conservative (as mine is) and you want the plot to follow  the Biblical account, then you may not care for it.
The overall story about The Company that carries over from book to book is interesting, as is the original character of Mendoza.  However, the subplots in each book can get pretty tedious.  In fact, they're less  &quot;plot&quot; than they are philosophical musings by the author.  I  found myself skimming a lot of pages.<br />In addition, the characters are  difficult to connect with.  They don't seem to have normal emotions nor  interact with each other in normal ways.  Although they threaten each other  a lot, and although The Company is supposed to be a scary organization,  somehow nothing ever happens.  Everyone does as they're told, and there's  really no conflict.  I agree with the person who said the Indians talked  like modern California teens.  I have the feeling the author did this  deliberately, but I'm not sure why.  The plot device that interests me most  in these books is the relationship between Mendoza and Joseph...I'd like to  see more on that.<br />I think the author has an interesting idea, but I think  she needs to put more emphasis on plot, and develop her characters in a  more normal way.  Also, I think her ideological views can get pretty  heavy-handed at times, particularly her insistence that all of the world's  ills come straight from religion.
I was inspired to read this because I enjoyed &quot;Neverwhere&quot; so much.  They are two very different types of books.  Neverwhere has a gritty, modern edge to it, while this is more like a period fairy tale.  I  think he's a great writer:  both books have beautiful, witty prose that's a  pleasure to read.  Also, he has a vivid imagination and a talent for  story-telling.  The one thing I'd like to see, though, is better  characterization.  My only complaint with Stardust would be that the hero  and heroine seem flat and lifeless; I'd like to see more emotion.  That's  still a minor objection, given Neil Gaiman's many strengths.
&quot;Neverwhere&quot; is everything you would want in a novel:  it's funny, intelligent, exciting, suspenseful, romantic and sexy.  The book is dark, strange, witty and wonderful, while the prose is beautiful.  The  story will stay with me a long time...I loved it.
I bought this on a whim, partly inspired by the high rating given to it by other readers, but I was so disappointed in it.  Granted, one doesn't  expect a romance novel to be &quot;War and Peace&quot;, but even for the  genre, this was just so bad.  The author has absolutely no sense of the  manners and customs of the time....the characters seem to have stepped  right out of a suburban mall.  The plot is flat, the characters are so  stock (he's gorgeous, she's gorgeous), and the heroine has all the  character and will-power of wet kleenex.  The book only seems to be written  so that the author can string together a bunch of sex scenes, which are  meant to be exciting to the reader, I guess.  Again, granted it's a romance  novel, but I still expect a story along with the requisite sex bits.  Well,  I just expected better.  The time-travel romance &quot;Dragonfly in  Amber&quot; is light-years ahead of this book in terms of intelligence.
