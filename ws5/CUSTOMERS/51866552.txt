boy how quickly people seem to forget that wise counsel from the book of Proverbs chapter 3 verses 5-7. My whole review of this book lies in that scripture alone.  <br /> <br />5 Trust in the LORD with all thine heart; and lean not unto thine own understanding.  <br /> <br />6 In all thy ways acknowledge him, and he shall direct thy paths.  <br /> <br />7 Be not wise in thine own eyes: fear the LORD, and depart from evil.  <br /> <br />The answer is simple: If God tells you that something is true, what matters about man's reason and intelectual powers? The kinds of people who write these books are those who lack faith, and who think they are wiser than God. Be weary of such individuals.
It is so nice to see religious leaders start to realize that science and religion are not mutually exclusive, but that both look at the same thing from different viewpoints, as the Dalai Lama says here in his book.  <br /> <br />I hope to see more convergence of science and religion as we continue to improve our humanity. I also hope that we learn other powerful lessons from the Dalai Lama about using peace as our sword for both truth and justice. Violence is not the answer to all life's problems.

Whether you like her book or not, it is an influential book and it isn't going away. She is to conservatives what Marx is to liberals, i.e. the extreme version of what most conservatives believe. Her philosophy is flawed and most conservatives only really take parts of her philosophy, (most of the parts conservatives do not agree with deal with Rand's disdain for religion, which again is quite similar to Marx).  <br /> <br />Her book, Atlas Shrugged, deals with a hypothetical in an unreal world. What if those who went on strike were the \\"backbone\\" of society, rather than the poor lower class workers whose only apparent drive, according to Objectivists, is to tear down the powerful and intelligent. However, this hypothetical is not real. What Rand and Objectivists seem to forget is that the powerful and intelligent die, and are no more, yet someone still takes control. So if one or two, or even a bunch of them stop working, others will fill in and do the work.  <br /> <br />Rand and Objectivists cannot look at the real world, but have to use hypotheticals to explain their flawed philosophy. If you look at all the characters in her books, they are all one dimensional. Tell me, in real life, have you ever met a person who was perfect, who did everything exactly as he was supposed to do? I have never met anybody who did not have a flaw in their character. yet I am to believe, as Objectivists would like, that by following their philosophy, I have somehow attained perfection in my character. Even Greenspan has gone back on his words! <br /> <br />Rand's black and white view of the world fits well into conservative thought because they like to look at the world through a two-dimensional prism, or at least they like to believe they look at the world through a two-dimensional prism, but yet even Bush beds with dictators, i.e. Uzbekhistan. <br /> <br />The problem with Rand's book, which Objectivists can't stand being brought up about her book is that her heroes have no flawsand her villains have no redeeming qualities. But yet we are to believe Kadafi of Lybia changed overnight. How can that be? He's a villain, or at least he was. Can villains have redeeming qualities to Objectivists? <br /> <br />Another problem, which is the title of my review....look at the name of the book. It is called \\"Atlas Shrugged.\\" According to Rand, Atlas is a mythical being who holds the earth on his shoulders. Apparently, in her view, the earth begins to weigh heavier and heavier on his shoulders, strengthening the burden on poor Atlas. When one character is asked what does Atlas do with this extra burden, another character replies \\"he shrugs.\\" <br /> <br />So think about it. Rand's \\"Atlas\\" characters, the mighty, the rulers of business and industry....do they \\"shrug\\"? Is going on strike shrugging? So what is really her point? it seems that the book ought to actually be called \\"Atlas Revolutions\\". It seems more appropriate. If Atlas only shrugs, would not her mighty heroic characters just shrug their shoulders and get back to work? <br /> <br />Yet another example of how unrealistic her book really is. <br /> <br />Finally, and this last point is to the many Christians who find her book and her philosophy appealing, I have one question: <br /> <br />Was Christ selfish?
i haven't read the series yet and probably won't given that i now know that the anti-christ happens to be romanian. i too am romanian, born in the carpathian mountains and my middle name is nicolae. i'm sure the authors didn't mean that the actual anti-christ, when he does make himself known will be from romania, but just want all the readers out there to know that there are some good nicolaes born in the carpathian mountains in romania. that's all i have to say about that. enjoy reading the books though.<br />I do have to add, though, that I have browsed through the pages and actually found this series to be very plain and simple. For all those who like to use their brains, don't read these...however, if you want to vegitate, this is the perfect series for you.
I'm a big Lord of the Rings fan and I had learned that Tolkien was influenced greatly in his writing by the Kalevala legends, so I got this to learn more of that region's mythology. It's quite fascinating. I love the chants, especially the one to shut dogs up. :)

i was recommended to read this book and i did. i was not disappointed by the writing and the story. Orson Scott Card does a wonderful job building up the story, and gives a nice twist at the end that, to me, felt unexpected but wonderful. <br />a great read for kids of all ages.
truly and surely one of the best comic strips ever! were you to be sick in bed and need something to make you laugh, this is the best medicine!
i wanted to try this series TWICE, but each time, i just couldnt get past the part in the book where Richard gets the sword and can only use it with hate, or hate is one of the ways to use the sword. I'm sorry, but there's just something wrong when a good character needs to use hate in order to bring about justice. doesn't anyone else see that? <br />twice i couldnt get past that part of the story to see if the rest was good. up to that point, the story was quite good, and grabbed my attention. it was well written. but comon, get rid of hate man!

this book had an odd form of humor, but it was enjoyable to read. it is a quick read, i read entirely on a short flight two summers ago.
truly and surely one of the best ways to spend a Sunday afternoon if you are bored. READ THIS! it has some of the best and most inventive comedy ever!
This is one of my favorite books ever written. even though the plot is pretty simple, Stephen King does not bore us during the three hundred or so mile walk that these boys are competing in. Plus, i like walking, so i understood what it was like to go on long walks.

i read this book when i was a teenager and heavily addicted to Stephen King's books. i loved this one. Stephen King is a true talent at creating a story, drawing us in, and captivating us until the end. and this one doesnt let down.

This is Stephen King's second best book, behind only The Stand. This is a superbly written action story. it has a great plot, moves quickly and draws you in to this nightmare like no one else can. the book does start out a bit slowly, but picks up tremendously, ending with one explosive (literally) ending! <br />Don't watch the movie--you know the one with Ahnold! in it, because it was terrible. the adaptation screwed up the story. i wish that someone would do a true movie adaptation of this Stephen King masterpiece.

this is a great book that i read when i was much younger. honestly what attracted me to this book in particular (when i had not read the others in the series) was the cover. so i started reading and couldnt put the book down. a great read!

This book continues the adventures of Lyra. she meets up with a young boy named Will who has just killed a man. the plot is beautifully intricate and (what i love about this book) it makes you go hmmmm. that is the sign of a great book.
this is my favorite story by Mark Twain. what i love about it is just simply everything. I love the feel of a nice relaxing memorable summer while reading this book. he really brings out the life of this little town on the Mississippi, and has two of the most memorable characters ever written, Tom Sawyer and Huckleberry Finn. Excellent read for kids of all ages.
this book raises interesting questions about human nature. how true it is that when left to ourselves, we become more animalistic and less humane. i think, were the story to continue, the newly formed tribe would have crumbled under its own foundations. it would have been nice to see how far the kids would have gone on that island alone without adults.
One day, a few years back i was really bored and wanted to read something new and fresh. i heard about Philip Pullman and decided to give him a try. I'm glad i chose this book, the Golden Compass, for i was very impressed with the writing, the story, the creativity, and the world he imagined. it is a well written book that keeps you wanting to read further to see what happens to Lyra, our young heroine. it is written for youngsters but adults can enjoy it as well, especially with the questioning of Christianity as the trilogy unfolds.
i was told to read this book this one day when conversing over the book \\"1984.\\" so as i read this book, i had 1984 in mind and may have influenced my perception of Huxley's book.<br />it is a tremendous book about what life could be like in the future. in one way, our society is already heading in that direction with how free we are with our sexuality. i was in romania on a visit two months ago and saw a program from England on TV about sexuality. the program was amazingly blatant in its advice to people. it said things like \\"yeah if your husband isnt pleasing you enough, then a secret lover will work.\\" and other things similar.<br />it was also very interesting how Socialist the society seemed in Huxley's book. i dont know if he was criticizing Socialism (or at the time Communism) or saying that it was inevitable that society would lead to that.<br />in the end though, it is a worth while read for anyone who wants to think. ...
this book is written to criticize Stalin and the soviet empire. it shows how the revolution was honorable and positive, but lead to nothing new but the same treatment, just under new leadership.<br />one thing to remember, George Orwell was a socialist. he believed in socialism. but what he saw in the Soviet Union was an aberration of that. the Soviet Union, under both Lenin and Stalin became a totalitarian state--something that Orwell goes into much deeper in 1984--and not worthy of praise as a true socialist empire.
This is by far Stephen King's best book, though The Running Man under the non de plume Richard Bachman comes a close second. what excels in this story are the characters. he does a truly wonderful job paintbrushing a large canvas of very believable and well rounded characters. he also does a wonderful job going in detail about what could happen were such a virus present. <br />this was also turned into a very well made TV mini-series--the only mini-series i actually enjoyed watching.
if anyone doesnt like the way modern politics works, you can put the blame right at Miachiavelli's feet. his &quot;real world&quot; view of politics changed the way princes related to each other in Europe and then later, in the world. thankfully we have improved on his views somewhat, but he began it all with his short book.
this is an excellent and well written story. there are some truly memorable lines in this film as Huck and Tom take their adventures down the Mississippi.<br />A wonderful read for kids of all ages, including 50 year olds.
i've read this and other books similar and, being a Mormon, of course they make me mad. they attack what i hold dear. the problem with this book is not what it says, but how it says it. it is meant to vilify and attack. it is meant to be a full frontal assault on your beliefs. these kinds of books (no matter what religion they attack) are meant not to destroy the faith someone has in that person's respective religion, but rather it is to, in the end, make them doubt a belief in God. my sister no longer believes in God because a book like this attacked her faith in her religion.<br />Just remember who writes these books and why they write them. usually they are written by former members of that particular religion and they usually left by excommunication, meaning they hold a grudge. how else could they bear to write what they do unless they are full of hate? how else could they write such books unless they fear the growth of that religion?<br />they seem to forget that John said &quot;perfect love casteth out all fear.&quot; John also said, &quot; Beloved, let us alove one another: for love is of God; and every one that loveth is born of God, and knoweth God.He that loveth not knoweth not God; for God is love.&quot;<br />Why vilify? is that love?<br />i'm all for a true and honest look at Mormonism, there is nothing wrong with that. but this book is tailor-made to attack and destroy. it cannot have a good purpose.
Stephen King keeps up his magic with this great page turner. but i have one question:<br />WHEN IS THE NEXT ONE COMING OUT!!!
I'm rather surprised that there are no reviews for this book, which is a masterpiece of literature. I had to read this for my AP english class in high school about ten years ago, and i still remember the many great parts to this book. this book describes the life of the great Siddhartha and how he achieved enlightenment, becoming the great Buddha. there are beautiful imagery, my favorite being about the river and how it flows, and how life is like that river (sorry i dont remember the details of it, after all, i did read this ten years ago.)
this is Stephen King at his darn best!<br />with this book, he has created a magical world. i only hope he can finish it before leaving this planet. at the pace he is going, it doesnt look pretty for us Gunslinger fans.
Stephen King keeps up the action and thickens the plot in this series that (it seems) he just cant finish. i hope he does, but it's not looking pretty for us Gunslinger fans.
after the introduction into Roland's world in the Gunslinger, we get to meet three new characters with their own subplots, and boy what great writing is involved. Stephen King shows his mastery of the written word in this Gunslinger series. he also shows his great ability to keep us riveted throughout. definitely one of the best of King's works.
this is a powerful book and a must read for everybody. while some may say this book was written to criticize the corrupted Soviet empire, that is not true. Animal Farm was written for that purpose. this book was instead written to warn the free world of totalitarianism, something that could easily happen anywhere in the world, even in democracies like the US, or England, the setting of the book.
I've read this book like 20 times, just read it over and over again. i fell in love with both the story and the science involved. how creative! <br />the story involves Viktor and Teresa who are part of a group of colonists finding Newmanhome (i think that's what they called the new planet). anyways, the story also tells us of another &quot;being,&quot; named Wan-to, who lives in stars. the intertwining of the two plots are wonderful and very creative. Pohl, please continue the great creative writing.
why are we forced to read this GARBAGE in high school? this book was terrible. i really felt like jumping in the book and slappin' that guy around a bit. how could he just act like that? UGH!
this is one of stephen king's best books. i love how he intertwined the past and the future. i loved the scenes at school because i could relate to many of them while i was reading this book way back then in those seemingly interminable high school days.
wow! this is truly one of the greatest books written in the 20th century. it is well deserved the praise. it was later turned into one of the greatest films all time as well. it is a beautiful story about tolerance and racial prejudice. it also had probably the best Dad in the universe. i sure hope that someday i could be just as good of a father.
alright everybody, raise your hands who thinks that vilifying others is a Christ-like attitude? <br />i'm all for an honest look at Mormons. I wasn't happy living in Utah, i think many there are living hypocritically. but vilifying is another story. no one deserves that. i know that becoming a Mormon changed my life for the good and i saw it in others as well. to say that i, in my practices, end up being some kind of demon is an insult. <br />Shame on you Ed. why do you sink so low?
this is one hilarious story with some of the most memorable lines i have ever read in a book! great read!
it's funny, you know, the basis of pretty much all the arguments against Mormonism rises out of the idea that we don't follow &quot;traditional Christianity.&quot;  Well DUH!
For any book lover and anyone who likes to stimulate his or her imagination, this book (as is the whole series to date) provides great material for the imagination. this book continues the excellent writing and plotting. once you get to book 4 (goblet of fire), you can start seeing a pattern in Rowling's writing. but chamber of secrets is fresh, comedic, and enthralling.<br />it is a book that you can't put down. (for those worried about time, dont worry. it's a pretty quick read. in two or three hours you have finished reading the book.)
this is a great attempt for King to enter the realm of fantasy--a precursor for his later Gunslinger series. i have loved reading this story from the first time i read it 14 or so years ago. every summer, during my summer reading spurts, this is one of the books i keep pulling out to read again and again.
This is an excellent work into the problems of our society. whether we agree as to the true causes or not, families are being torn apart, and the institution of family is changing in america. I agree with much of what Wilson states about the structure of the divorce system being a big part of the problem. it is far too easy to divorce. it also doesn't demand as much of a punishment/sacrifice as it used to. therefore, if one is unhappy with his or her spouse, there are plenty others out there to wed. <br />We must not allow the family unit to disintegrate. once that happens, we are a lost and fallen society.
i had to write a paper for a geography class and figured why not do it on yugoslavia. while researching, i came across this book, and thought it was a marvelous read. it is a fascinating look at the decline of yugoslavia from Tito, who ran the country remarkably well and who had a miraculously peaceful tenure as \\"Emperor.\\" then Milosevic showed up and [messed] it all up. the thing i find very excellent about this book is that it describes very well how milosevic got that power. he used nationalism to his advantage to get the serbs behind him. this nationalism lead to the bloody split-up of croatia, slovenia, bosnia-herzegovina, macedonia, and finally kosovo. this book shows one of the best (or worst, depending on how you look at it) examples of nationalism and the effects of nationalism. it is especially good to observe what happened to Milosevic in light of recent events throughout europe, with the hard-right gaining popularity, in such places as Romania, Hungary, and even in more tolerant France and the Netherlands. it is a worthwhile read to observe similarities between what milosevic said and did and what these new right-wing leaders are saying and doing.
i enjoyed reading this story, and am happy that Rowling made it longer. the characters are enjoyable to follow and a longer story just made it even better. i am a fast reader, and were it short, i would have finished it too quickly.<br />i give it only four stars because it does feel like she has already used up her imaginative stuff in the first three and now is beginning to repeat her stuff. it may be that she was rushed into finishing this book. we'll see if a pattern holds up once we get the fifth book out.
for someone who loves political theory, this is an excellent book to read that delves deeply into what causes revolutions and what creates a dictatorship and what creates a democracy. the only problem with this book is that it can't seem to take an account of why India is still a democracy. the peasants won in india, but they are still a democracy.
i liked the introduction on fiction writers...that has stuck with me ever since i read it....
I did not read this book before i saw the 1984 movie. that said, when i did actually read this book, i was riveted in a great socio-political conflict between two great houses and other parties involved. the story was wonderfully written and well worth the read for anyone who likes a good story. <br />my qualm with the book comes from the idea that this is a sci-fi book. beyond the names of the houses and the idea that this takes place on different planets, this story could have easily taken place in ancient rome. as a matter of fact while i read the book, my first thoughts were to rome. who knows, maybe it was because i had just watched gladiator before reading this book. but the point is that this book lacked much of anything sci-fi. and i was a bit bummed that Herbert didnt get into the details of the spaceships, how they travelled, the weaponry and everything else actually dealing with science. even the battle scenes themselves are brief, with most action coming from conversations and the intrigue going on. and i guess i'm getting picky now that i have been reading Robert Jordan's Wheel of Time, where he combines both political and social intrigue with some kick butt fighting scenes. that seems to be lacking in Dune, though the story is wonderfully written. that's why i give it only 3 stars.<br />PS: whatever you do, don't watch the Dune TV mini-series. stick to the original where a truly creative director helmed the show...
i was just flipping through some of the other reader's reviews and realized something....all those who complain just seem to want a quick Tom Clancy-like, shoot-em up story. i am rereading winter's heart right now and realized something. robert jordan is creating a whole world of characters. he is creating a whole world of events. remember, he is creating the Last Battle. do you think that only three or four main characters would be involved in something that grand? remember that the Dragon Reborn is to break the world again. what world is he breaking if we cannot see it? how do we know he is breaking it? what is being changed? robert jordan is showing all the events related to the Dragon Reborn's change. and that is asking a lot. be thankful that Jordan knows how to weave the storylines so well and intricate that it is a pleasure to read.
i haven't read the series yet and probably won't given that i now know that the anti-christ happens to be romanian. i too am romanian, born in the carpathian mountains and my middle name is nicolae. i'm sure the authors didn't mean that the actual anti-christ, when he does make himself known will be from romania, but just want all the readers out there to know that there are some good nicolaes born in the carpathian mountains in romania. that's all i have to say about that. enjoy reading the books though.

one thing i've always had against fantasy stories, including this series is that they never seem to give the enemies more than a two dimensional characterization. this one attempts it rather well with the forsaken and some of the darkfriends, but trollocs are just fodder for rand's lightning strikes. <BR>but my own pet pieves aside, this story is rich and complex. this world that robert jordan has created is imaginative and innovative. it may seem like he is using some stereotypes from our own cultures throughout our world, but he's mixed it up well enough to be considered his own creation. <br />the story will engross you, as it should and you will be caught up in the characters' drive for survival. enjoy it, and all nine books so far.

i'm just about done reading this book for only the second time in my life and i still love it. what a rich world tolkein created. the only problem i would have with this story is that the bad guys, the orcs, the nazgul, the black riders, and so on, are pretty much two dimensional. it may not have gone well with the flow of this story, but it would have been nice to see more richness in their characterization. that's a small pebble of gripe in the ocean of creativity though. a wonderful tale...and i hope the film will be as good if not better.

this is a good supplemental to have with the books. in the 9000 pages or so of reading we've all done so far, it's hard to get the history of his world down, so it's nice to see it more organized and not scattered through the current story. i just hope we get more immersed in the shara and seanchan worlds. that would be fun. it would be a waste if we don't actually see those two worlds, if all the action happens only in the current land.

what else can i say, i bought this for a friend in romania and haven't gotten it to her yet, but i looked it over briefly. it's an interesting look at women's tennis and what venus williams has added to the mix.
this trilogy was quite good and i do recommend it to everyone. it is creative and original.
although i don't proscribe to the ideals of nationalism, being a socialist, this book delves deeply and thoughtfully on an intriguing topic. the developing world was created on nationalism and now around the world, in countries that are developing we are trying to stifle nationalist feelings because they, while the building blocks of nations, also tend to be very violent. trying to understand how nations are created is very difficult and very complex, but this book sheds great light on the question of nationalism and how it is founded everywhere, including here in america.
you know, i was impressed with Samuel Huntington's &quot;Third Wave,&quot; because it described very well how the third wave of democratization occured in 1989. yet this book, while it has good points about civilizations and their role in modern politics, tends to become political and extreme to the right. he doesn't seem to grasp the islamic religion and seems to say that the best foreign policy towards islamic countries would be that of control. for some reason, according to huntington, we cannot allow islamic or arab countries to have a growing influence in the world. it is sad that a few terrorist attacks by extremists, who could be compared with anti-abortion extremists killing doctors, paint the entire islamic world as extremist and evil, when if you think about it, there are over 1 billion muslims in the world, yet i don't belive, last i checked, that there are 1 billion terrorists. grow up and start respecting the rest of the world. the first step in doing so would be not to read this book.
i started reading this book and didn't get very far. i wasn't as interested in it as i was in teh golden compass and that trilogy. i found that to be more engaging, so i was hoping this would be as well, but it's not.
i haven't read the series yet and probably won't given that i now know that the anti-christ happens to be romanian. i too am romanian, born in the carpathian mountains and my middle name is nicolae. i'm sure the authors didn't mean that the actual anti-christ, when he does make himself known will be from romania, but just want all the readers out there to know that there are some good nicolaes born in the carpathian mountains in romania. that's all i have to say about that. enjoy reading the books though.
well, i was happy with Samuel Huntington's Third Wave, but this one seems too political and not so much based on theoretical research. i like his ideas about civilization, but he doesn't show much respect for the Arab nations, and tries to present policy that further alienates and isolates Arab countries.
because in my class i would get docked points just for not putting a  period in the correct spot! oh well. it's not too bad of a book. quite  complex though. you'd think that our civilization becoming more advanced,  we'd find an easier way to write. oh well, we can't all have the world.
