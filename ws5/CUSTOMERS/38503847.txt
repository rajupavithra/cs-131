The book, Illusions: The Adventures of A Reluctant Messiah, by Richard Bach is an absolutely amazing piece of writing.  It allows you to think for yourself, and by this I mean every single person that reads this book will interpret its meanings differently, which is probably the point Richard Bach is trying to make. This book has actually changed a part of me; the way I look at and think about life.  It is difficult to describe how, but I know that the change is for the better. It is absolutely amazing and I would encourage ANYONE who comes across this book to read it a thousand times.  It is different every time, depending on what point you are at in your life.  However, if you don't already think a little like the way this book is written (there are no limits!), then I would advise you not to expect a change.  Whether you believe in what this \\"The Handbook of Life\\" is trying to testify or not, it is still a great read. Don't pass up any opportunity to buy it, borrow it from the library, or read it!  <BR>Suggestion: read this writing with an open mind.
