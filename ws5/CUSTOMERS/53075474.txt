Rachel DeWoskin gives an account of her several years in China, straight from completing a degree in English at Columbia University in 1994, and staying until after the accidental bombing of the Chinese embassy in Belgrade in 1999. The time period of the book was one of significant change in China, with creeping capitalism and enormous economic changes occurring as a result.<br /><br />Childhood trips to China and studying Chinese in college gave her significant preparation, but the book describes some of the significant differences between Chinese and American cultures that make the Chinese seem mysterious and inscrutable to Americans. The book is a fascinating look at China's love-hate relationship with America.<br /><br />DeWoskin starts with a job with a PR firm for American companies doing business in China (trying to avoid making elementary mistakes that would embarrass them in China, with varying degrees of success), and chances into a role in a Chinese soap opera at $80/show that ended up being viewed by hundreds of millions of Chinese (the \\"Foreign Babes in Beijing\\" show of the book's title).<br /><br />I read this book after reading Ben Mezrich's Ugly Americans, as I wanted to read more about Asian culture (with a focus on China as an emerging economic power rather than Japan)--this was a good, lightweight introduction to some of the cultural differences in the context of an individual woman's somewhat amusing stories of her experiences there.
It took me a while to get through this book--I first opened it in December 2003 and finished it in June 2005, but this is an extremely important book for anyone interested in the origins, functions, and evolution of religion. It's potentially a dangerous book--certain aspects of what this book argues about religious inferences could be used to devise cults or improve the effectiveness of proselytization--but I suspect a typical cult leader would find more value in that regard from Cialdini's Influence. If Boyer's view is right, most religions are likely to fail, anyway--there's no reason to expect an average aspiring cult leader will create a mega-religion than an average businessman will become a multimillionaire.<br /><br />Those who are adherents of a particular religion should be interested in this book, if for nothing else than an explanation for how all other religions work. (But such readers should then ask themselves how their own religion is any different.) Boyer's book makes sense of the geographic distribution of religious belief, which supernatural accounts of religion fail to explain.<br /><br />This book sees religious doctrine, dogma, and institutions as secondary to religion's primary role in social interactions, dealing with death and the disposal of dead bodies, and providing explanations for misfortune or other impersonal events for which causal or purposeful explanations may not be available. Dogma arises along with institutions as a barrier to entry into the business of being a professional religious advocate, a person with specialized skills or powers in communicating with the divine, as a way of classifying competitors as impostors or heretics and enforcing \\"quality control\\"--essentially the same role as a trade union. Yet for most religious adherents, the dogma is relatively unimportant.<br /><br />Boyer sees religious beliefs and inferences as produced by normal reasoning about earthly agents, with only minor modifications (e.g., the agents are unseen). Too many modifications to standard templates yield unbelievable results that are no part of any religion, but minor modifications make for memorable results that are more likely to be passed on. The prototypical religious belief is a specific inference (\\"this calamity indicates that the ancestors are angry\\") rather than a general doctrine; general doctrines are more flexible and evolve over time.<br /><br />The book contains nine chapters which discuss the origins of religion, religious concepts and inferences, an account of mental processes useful in ordinary life that are also relevant to religious reasoning, a chapter on why gods and spirits are the primary subject matter of religions and one on the functions served by gods and spirits, a chapter on the relevance of death to religion (and vice versa), a chapter on rituals and their functions, a chapter on religious institutions, exclusion, violence, and fundamentalism (which Boyer sees as a reaction against competition that raises the costs associated with defection), and one on the role of religious belief.<br /><br />In the end, the message of Boyer's book is rather pessimistic for the skeptic about religion--his account makes religious adherence natural, and skepticism a resistance to naturally evolved tendencies to make inferences. I think he's got the basic outlines right, and this is an essential book for anyone interested in understanding religion.gents are unseen).

Christopher Boone is the 15-year-old (15 years, 3 months, and 3 days old at p. 40), high-functioning autistic narrator of this story, which begins with his discovery of Mrs. Shears' dog, Wellington, dead on her lawn, stabbed through with a \\"garden fork.\\" Christopher is a fan of Sherlock Holmes (but not of Sir Arthur Conan Doyle, since he believed in things that weren't true). He decides to apply detective skills and logic to the case and make that the focus of a book he is writing for school.<br /><br />This is not quite the ordinary mystery novel. In the process we learn quite a bit about Christopher's mental life, his lack of understanding of human social skills, his mathematical capability, his unusual ways of categorizing days.  Christopher also knows a wealth of facts, and the book touches upon details of Sherlock Holmes stories, Sir Arthur Conan Doyle's being fooled about the Cottingley Fairies, astronomy, the Turing Test, and studies of children's awareness of and reasoning about the existence of other minds, among other things. As these are all topics of interest to me, I was entertained and amused to see Christopher use them in figuring out the world around him.<br /><br />Haddon does a great job of depicting Christopher's viewpoint and making a person empathy-deficient into a sympathetic character.
This book is a very entertaining fictionalized account of \\"John Malcolm\\" (apparently based on 1993 Princeton graduate Michael Lerch), a Princeton football player who moved to Japan to take a job as a derivatives trader under \\"Dean Carney\\" at Kidder Peabody in Osaka, but leaving after the scandal involving Joseph Jett. He then goes to work for Barings Securities of Singapore, only to see it collapse after the illicit trading of Nick Leeson, and goes to work at \\"Carney\\"'s own firm, called ASC. At ASC, he has run-ins with the Yakuza, falls in love with the daughter of the owner of a hostess bar in Tokyo, and ultimately makes the deal-of-all-deals to get out of the business.<br /><br />It is clear that there has been massive fictionalization in the book, apparently based on the author's visit(s) to Japan. One example of fiction is an anachronism on p. 21, which supposedly takes place in September 1992. Mezrich writes that Malcolm visits a Rappongi district bar in Tokyo \\"called Gas Panic and, like a lot of things in Japan, the name didn't make any sense unless you were there.\\" Mezrich misses the fact that this bar (a popular place for foreigners in Tokyo, there are actually several of them) is named after the Aum Shinrikyo sarin gas attack in the Tokyo subway on March 20, 1995.<br /><br />Mezrich was quoted in a Boston Globe profile (August 8, 2004) as saying that he is creating a new genre of \\"young people making tons of money at the edge of ethics and morality.\\" That profile described his works in this genre as \\"imaginatively enhanced nonfiction,\\" and quoted him as saying that he'd like to live like characters in his books (the seven-figure advance for this one, along with the movie options on this and Bringing Down the House couldn't hurt), and that he has trouble with/lacks interest in the fact-checking part of his work. The book includes a fair amount of description of the Japanese \\"Water Trade\\" (sex-related businesses), including hostess bars and \\"image clubs.\\"<br /><br />Regardless of the degree of accuracy, this is a fast-paced and entertaining book that reads like a novel.<br /> <br />Regardless of the degree of accuracy, this is a fast-paced and entertaining book that reads like a novel.
I attended the 2005 Skeptics Society conference on Brain, Mind, and Consciousness at Caltech, where Ramachandran had been scheduled to speak but was unable to do so because of a family emergency. Although I was not previously familiar with his work, the description led me to believe he was a speaker I would be interested in hearing, and this book, which I purchased at the conference, provides a strong case for that. I've long had an interest in philosophy of mind and cognitive science, and minored in cognitive science in my Ph.D. studies (never completed) at the University of Arizona. I've been out of academia for 11 years now, and apart from reading occasional works like Daniel Dennett's Consciousness Explained and Freedom Evolves, I've not been keeping close tabs on the field. The conference and this book were quite a pleasure--it is clear that there have been some significant developments over the last decade.<br /><br />It is hard to believe that there are still people who think the brain is little more than a radio receiver, a set of mechanical controls for a disembodied spirit to manipulate the body. Ramachandran's book--like the case studies of Oliver Sacks and A.N. Luria--shows how wrongheaded that view is.<br /><br />This is a thin (112 pages of text, 45 pages of notes), very accessible and entertaining book. If you enjoy the works of Sacks and Luria, you are likely to enjoy this as well. This is not a collection of case studies, though there are some descriptions of particular patients--it is written from a higher elevation, bringing together recent results, explaining unusual phenomena, and speculating about how those phenomena may tie in to a further understanding of the details of the brain's function.<br /><br />The book came from Ramachandran's BBC Reith lectures, so it is for a popular audience, with the notes providing some more underlying detail. There are five chapters, each dealing with a single topic. The first chapter is about amputees who experience pain in their \\"phantom limbs\\" and how the parts of the brain which had been devoted to the now-absent limbs can become mapped to still-present parts of the body which are handled by physically proximate parts of the brain. For example, a patient whose left arm had been amputated could feel contact to the nonexistent fingers of his left hand from touches to parts of his face or upper arm. Ramachandran then uses this remapping phenomenon to speculate about the causes of Capgras' syndrome (where a patient believes people he knows have been replaced with  impostors), synesthesia, and pain asymbolia, where a patient responds to pain stimulus with laughter.<br /><br />The second chapter is about vision, and specifically about the phenomena of blindsight (where a person has no experience of seeing, but at an unconscious level does see), hemisphere neglect, and mirror agnosia. In this chapter Ramachandran discusses \\"mirror neurons,\\" neurons found in monkeys which activate when a monkey performs some task, but also when the monkey sees another monkey perform the same task.<br /><br />The third chapter, \\"The Artful Brain,\\" is the most speculative, and provides Ramachandran's suggested ten \\"universal laws of art,\\" which he offers as features we find aesthetically pleasing in art, and discusses some reasons why those features might be pleasing to the brain.<br /><br />The fourth chapter deals in more detail with synesthesia, the perception of stimuli with multiple senses, such as experiencing colors corresponding with sounds or numbers. He links this to cross-activation of sites in the brain (similar to his discussion in the first chapter), points out some similar phenomena that most people share (such as a tendency to associate certain kinds of abstract shapes with certain sounds or names), and speculates that such associations may have paved the way for the evolution of language from non-verbal communication.<br /><br />The fifth and final chapter is titled \\"Neuroscience--The New Philosophy.\\" Ramachandran discusses how some of the phenomena of neuroscience might bear on questions from philosophy of mind about qualia, free will, and self-awareness. The chapter doesn't get very deep into any of these philosophical issues, but it's clear that more has been learned in the last few decades of neuroscience than in the last few millenia of philosophy.<br /><br />I highly recommend this book as an introduction to these topics.tled \\"Neuroscience--The New Philosophy.\\" Ramachandran discusses how some of the phenomena of neuroscience might bear on questions from philosophy of mind about qualia, free will, and self-awareness.

This is a fascinating tale about people who are completely nuts.  Unfortunately, many of these people who are completely nuts hold or have held senior positions in the United States military. Ronson rarely writes a judgmental word, but allows his subject to speak for themselves--and hang themselves with their own words. (At least, that's the impression--obviously Ronson has selected which of their words to present.)<br /><br />Ronson looks at ideas for a \\"First Earth Battallion\\" by soldier-turned-newage-marketing-guru Jim Channon, who proposed in 1979 that the military put greater emphasis on influencing people with alternative weapons such as paranormal abilities and music. Ronson traces the use of music in warfare to the use of loud music by the FBI at the Branch Davidian compound in Waco, Texas and as a torture technique used by the U.S. military at Guantanamo Bay and in Iraq.<br /><br />The book covers a wide-ranging territory of nuttiness, including Uri Geller (who is quoted in the book suggesting that he has been re-activated for use by the U.S. military), the remote viewers at Ft. Meade (Joe McMoneagle, Ingo Swann, Pat Price, Ed Dames, etc.), the non-lethal weaponry of UFO and paranormal investigator Col. John Alexander, the connections between the remote viewers and Courtney Brown--and then to Art Bell and Heaven's Gate, and the CIA's MKULTRA experiments and the death-by-LSD of Frank Olson and his son Eric's search for the facts about his death.<br /><br />The book is alternately amusing and horrifying. It would be funny if this craziness wasn't taken so seriously by high-ranking officials who have put it into practice, wasting tax dollars and occasionally producing horribly unethical outcomes.<br /><br />I highly recommend this book.
I found this to be an entertaining, exciting, optimism-generating book, but after reading it I'm afraid I can't be as optimistic as the authors are. On the one hand, a large component of the book is essentially just spelling out the laws of thermodynamics, and it can't be argued with. Of the myths they debunk, in several cases they make their case quite well--there is always going to be energy waste (that's part of the laws of thermodynamics), increases in efficiency do not result in reduced consumption of energy, and overall demand for energy is continually increasing. I think their suggested path of oil-independence not by continuing to expand the burning of coal (as the U.S. has been doing for the last few decades) but by building new nuclear capacity is sensible. They suggest some other technologies that may also turn out positively (including nuclear fusion). Their comments on the alternative energy production methods already in place (diesel generators and delivery trucks) are fascinating.<br /><br />Where I part ways with the authors is on their assumption that continued success in finding new sources of energy (or better ways at getting at current sources of energy) is inevitable. Yes, we've been successful so far, but this is one area where we can be certain that in a long enough run, the past will not predict the future. (Or, alternatively, they make the mistake of not looking at other relevant past records, like the records of both species extinctions and civilizations that collapse.) I was almost expecting the authors to cite Frank Tipler's The Physics of Immortality, as part of an argument for an infinite human future. They don't go quite as far as Tipler, arguing that we could upload ourselves into a computer simulation which would produce infinite computation and allow all possibilities to be  realized in a finite future--they limit the future to \\"as long as the sun continues to shine, and the planet rotates, and the depths of the cosmos stay cold\\" (p. 188).<br /><br />There is much of value in this book. Like a recent issue of The Economist (April 23-29, 2005), they present arguments for a rational environmentalism that accounts for costs and benefits, and show that steps to preserve a clean environment are a good and effective use of some of the increased energy consumption (at the cost of reduced efficiency).<br /><br />I recommend the book, with reservations. The parts that are founded on implications of the laws of thermodynamics and solid research support are sound, but there are also claims which run far beyond the support provided (like \\"we will never run out of energy\\").y cold\\" (p. 188). <br /> <br />There is much of value in this book.

I picked up this book on \\"a study of gurus\\" after reading about it in John Horgan's excellent book, Rational Mysticism. The book is composed of biographical sketches of a number of gurus--Gurdjieff, Rasjneesh, Rudolf Steiner, Carl Jung, Sigmund Freud, Ignatius Loyola, and Jesus, with occasional remarks about others such as Jim Jones and David Koresh. Storr attempts to identify commonalities among gurus--egocentric, experiencing some kind of personal crisis or madness, re-integrating their personality after the crisis, creating worldviews independent of what was socially accepted, seeking the approval of followers, etc. He distinguishes within the category of gurus between those who act ethically (the saints) from those who are corrupt and abuse their followers (the sinners and the madmen).<br /><br />The remaining chapters of the book examine some of the features identified in the biographical sections in more detail and concludes with a final chapter about those who follow gurus, and the benefits they receive from such a relationship.<br /><br />The book was quite readable, but I found it remarkably light-weight--it seems entirely like armchair theorizing, without the benefit of any kind of detailed scientific research. I learned about the specific gurus described, but I didn't feel like I learned anything solid about what the conditions are that create them, their effects on the world, or how to wean people away from them.
Mitnick's followup to his excellent Art of Deception is a collection of hacker stories, mostly attributed to pseudonyms, each followed up with a description of how the successful exploitation of vulnerabilities could have been prevented.<br /><br />The stories are mixed in quality and plausibility, but the defensive advice is generally quite good and on-target. The story from the l0pht is particularly amusing, the story of company that enters into negotiations to purchase them, only to make the mistake of agreeing to a no-holds-barred penetration test of their infrastructure as a preliminary.<br /><br />The initial story in the book, about hacking slot machines, seems rather implausible, especially given the apparent necessity of a plus-or-minus 5 ms accuracy in response time (p. 8), since human beings take 10-20 times that amount of time to perceive and respond to a stimulus.<br /><br />Particularly disappointing was that Mitnick gave so much space and sympathy to \\"Robert,\\" a seriously ethically challenged hacker in chapter 8. \\"Robert\\" is a hacker who worked for porn spammers by breaking into porn websites to collect email addresses, yet allegedly works in security for a \\"very religious and upstanding company\\" (p. 168).<br /><br />This book doesn't quite measure up to its predecessor, but it is an entertaining book. Most of the defensive advice is old hat for security professionals, but could prove useful to executives, small business owners, and novices interested in security.
The book is the story of Art, a member of the Eastern Standard Tribe living and working in London for Virgin/Deutsche Telekom, where he designs user interfaces for new products.  The book jumps back and forth between two timelines, a later one where Art is atop a mental institution to which he's been committed, and an earlier one where he's found a new girlfriend, Linda, after hitting her with his car.  The book progresses quickly until the timelines meet and everything is wrapped up.<br /><br />It's a very quick read, and I agree with reviewers who found it to be too short and superficial.  But despite its lightness, it is an extremely entertaining book, and contains numerous interesting ideas which are worthy of fuller development in both reality and fiction.
This was given to me for my birthday as a gag gift, but I had to read it anyway, which I did on an international plane flight. I was expecting more \\"nerd\\" given the title, but the title character, Mitchell J. Carruthers, Jr. was really a former nerd turned bodyguard, disguised as a nerd. His nerdhood was demonstrated in the book only through references to his skills at financial management and his ability to look up information on the Internet.<br /><br />I don't believe I've ever read another romance novel, but this seems like a rather stereotypical one, from what I've heard. The ultimate outcome (woman gets nerd) seems a foregone conclusion from the second or third chapter, but there's a lot of tease from there to the actual hookup.<br /><br />The narrative focus alternates between Mitchell and Ally Jarrett (the female protagonist, an heiress who wants to make it as a wildlife photographer without relying on her millions), and the very simple plot involves an Uncle who wants to obtain some or all of the inheritance for himself. There are some minor characters who are townspeople in Porcupine, Alaska, where all of the action takes place (apart from a brief scene in Anchorage) to introduce some minor subplots, conflicts, and comedy. By my reading, the only one who \\"goes wild\\" is Ally in chapters 2-3, though perhaps the inevitable hookup of the two main characters also is meant to count.<br /><br />This was a mildly enjoyable read, but those expecting more nerd content will be disappointed.
Richard Abanes has put together an extremely readable history of the Mormon church, which demonstrates that Mormonism is a bogus religion, founded on the fabrications of Joseph Smith. Abanes gives background on Smith and his family, his career as a \\"money-digger\\" who used \\"seeing stones\\" to bilk gullible people out of money by offering to find buried treasure for them. He describes the cultural background of upstate New York where Smith grew up, and shows that the notion that American Indians were from the Lost Tribe of Israel was in currency prior to Smith's writing that account into the Book of Mormon. He shows that Smith plagiarized parts of the Book of Mormon from works such as Ethan Smith's View of the Hebrews (1823) and Josiah Priest's The Wonders of Nature and Providence Revealed (1825), as well as how elements of Freemasonry were incorporated into the Mormon religion. He shows how Smith's accounts of his visions changed over time, and how the Mormon church has rewritten its history. He covers the controversies of the church--polygamy, the doctrine of blood atonement, the role of Brigham Young and church leaders in the murders at the Meadow Mountain Massacre, and racism in the church, all in historical context with extensive citations to original documentation.<br /><br />The book is well-documented (about a quarter of the text is end notes). The Mormon responses to Abanes book online at the FAIRLDS.org site appear to be designed for Mormons who haven't read the book--they are pathetic by comparison to the book, and even if all of their objections were effective, they leave the bulk of Abanes' book untouched.<br /><br />I think that Abanes makes his case very well up until chapter 17, \\"Is Mormonism Christian?\\", which is marred by some exceedingly poor argument and blindness to the failures of Abanes' own religious views--he seems not to recognize the syncretistic nature of Christianity and how it has evolved, and that fundamentalist Christianity didn't exist until the 20th century. On p. 390, Abanes writes \\"Rather than asking 'Are Mormons Christian?,' a better question would be 'Are Christians Mormon?' An affirmative answer to the first question would certainly mean an affirmative answer to the second one.\\" He writes that LDS members don't allow all Christians into their temples, therefore Mormons don't recognize all Christians as Mormons, therefore Mormons aren't Christians. This argument is as erroneous as saying that if baseball is a sport, then all sports must be baseball. Abanes also argues that Mormon is not Christian because when Mormons find conflicts between Smith's scripture (the Book of Mormon, the Doctrine and Covenants, and the Pearl of Great Price) and the Bible, the favor Smith's. He fails to recognize that the Mormon church stands in the same relation to Christianity that Christianity does to Judaism--when conflicts appear between the Old Testament and the New, Christians side with the latter (and attempt to explain them away). Mormons do the same.  Abanes seems not to recognize the enormous diversity within Christianity that has existed since the 1st century C.E., and his argument that Mormonism cannot be Christian could be paralleled by the Eastern Orthodox Church against the Roman Catholic Church, and by the Roman Catholic Church against Protestants.<br /><br />In the end, Abanes makes a rock-solid case that Mormonism is founded on myths and deception--but if he pursued his own religious views with as critical an eye, he'd be forced to the same conclusion about them.ist until the 20th century.

While having dinner with his parents, Teller learned that his father had drawn a series of cartoons which he had been unable publish in the Philadelphia Inquirer, and he realized that he did not know much about his parents' lives before his own. He spent time talking to them about their childhoods and how they met, the result of which is this book of reminiscences, quotes from correspondence, and cartoons, drawings, and paintings. While Teller's parents may feel that their son's celebrity has overshadowed their lives, this book shows that their lives are quite interesting in their own right. Teller's father traveled to all of the 48 (at the time) U.S. states, and to Alaska, mostly by rail as a hobo. This is a small, high-quality book printed on heavy paper with illustrations on nearly every page. It's a pleasant tribute from Teller to his father (and mother).
Penn argues for atheism, subtly promotes the Libertarian Party (pp. 96-97), argues against newage (p. 101), criticizes Buddhism (pp. 139, 186), explains cold reading (pp. 184-185), puts Scientology in its place (pp. 163, 210), and tells an entertaining story of a NYPD diver and murder from the point of  view of the diver's boyhood sock monkey.<br /><br />I enjoyed the book very much. The ending of many paragraphs with pop culture references was at first annoying, but it became more comfortable as the book progressed, and the lines were well selected. (There's a site on the Internet that lists them all and where they came from.)<br /><br />My only complaint is a very jarring change of voice that occurs in a paragraph on pp. 166-167 (\\"a friend of ours\\").
While I found much to dismay and horrify me within this book, I suspect I also often did not interpret things in the way the author intended. The author seems to hold a viewpoint in which if you avoid paying a tax--even legally--you have gained income, rather than merely avoided an expense. The author seems to hold the view there is a fixed amount of tax that is the right amount to collected, and if one person or entity reduces its tax burden, it thereby increases the burden on everyone else, cheating them. This is a judgment without any regard to the other side of the coin, government spending. While I agree that at the extremes (many of which are portrayed in this book), there is clear-cut cheating and not paying a fair share by any reasonable standard, I would not agree that all or even most legal tax avoidance falls into that category. Those who favor limited government and balanced budgets are likely to have a similar reaction to much of what the author writes.<br /><br />That said, however, he makes a very strong case that the U.S. tax system is unfair and corrupt, that the IRS is limited in its ability to go after tax cheats who are breaking the law, and that the net effect is to give tremendous benefits to the richest of the rich, while the burden on everyone else (regardless of whether those taxes are being collected for legitimate or frivolous purposes) has increased.<br /><br />He has chapters on how the alternative minimum tax (AMT) is completely broken and is now impacting a growing number of the middle class, how tax-exempt insurance companies are being exploited as a mechanism for storing hundreds of millions of dollars in investments and avoiding taxes on the gains, on those who simply refuse to file or pay income taxes at all, on<br /><br />the effects of Reagan-era payroll tax increases, on tax-evading partnership schemes and the IRS's complete inability to devote any resources to detecting them, on American companies moving their headquarters to Bermuda to avoid taxes, and on the destruction of pensions at many large companies. All are fascinating reading.<br /><br />I agree with the author that something should be done, and that something should include a complete overhaul and simplification of the U.S. tax code, to make it fair and enforceable. But I am not optimistic that anything will be done--I think the level of corruption in the federal government is so high, and that because the behavior of bureaucrats and legislators is more accurately described by public choice theory than by political science, that it is unlikely we'll see radical change in a positive direction.rmuda to avoid taxes, and on the destruction of pensions at many large companies.

I am surprised that one Amazon reviewer found the structure of this book to be inscrutable. I thought it was a well-structured book, which began and ended with the story of a disappearing donkey illusion, with the portion in between showing the history and development of the principles of illusion that made it possible. The elephant of the title is, in effect, a bit of illusion itself, since that trick as performed by Houdini turned out not to be very impressive to the audience, but a similar principle was used to greater effect for making a donkey disappear.<br /><br />The book's focus is on illusions that involve disappearance using optical effects, but it covers far more territory in order to set the stage and context. From \\"Pepper's Ghost\\" and the effects of early film (George Melies) to the optical effects of Charles Morritt and John Nevil Maskelyne, with side trips into the spirit cabinet of the Davenport brothers and the escapes of Houdini, the book includes a wealth of history of magic.<br /><br />Steinmeyer's book examines the nature of magic, and what makes an effective performance. He argues that a common implication of books of magic tricks is incorrect: \\"that executing and concealing the secret is always the ultimate goal of the exercise\\" (p. 93). Rather, he argues that \\"the deception in a magic show is a negative element, a hole in the middle of the performance. The performance is a sort of inadvertent dance around this hole, with the hope that each spectator will be coaxed to slip through it. ... The real art is in the subtle touches of reassurance that surround any deception and disguise it as a positive thing. With a gesture, a suggestion, ... the audience is convinced that they are watching a genuine wonder\\" (p. 94).<br /><br />Steinmeyer's book is a genuine wonder, and I highly recommend it along with the works of Ricky Jay.
I found this book to be an engrossing tale of the personalities and technologies that resided in Xerox's Palo Alto Research Center (PARC)--some invented there, some developed more fully there, and many only being produced by other companies due to Xerox's short-sightedness. The laser printer, the mouse, windowing systems and overlapping windows, bitmapped graphics, computer processing of video images, the personal computer, Ethernet, email.<br /><br />Hiltzik does a good job of presenting many faces in a large cast of characters and describing the alliances and clashes within Xerox PARC (and between PARC and the rest of Xerox). Of particular note is the greater detail on the story of Steve Jobs visits to PARC and how they occurred (Xerox was briefly an investor in Apple), in far more detail than has been given elsewhere (e.g., in Levy's Insanely Great).
This book tells the author's story of how he lost everything he had gambling, took a crappy job as shill--promoted to baccarat dealer--at the Four Queens in Las Vegas, and then had the opportunity to join a group of gambling cheaters and thieves. The cheating moves described in the book are mostly \\"pastposting\\"--placing high bets after the outcome is known by swapping in a new stack of chips for the ones previously bet. The trick is that high-value chips are concealed underneath low-value chips, and the cheater often has to issue a \\"claim\\" by pointing out to the dealer that he's been underpaid for the bet. The book begins and ends with a move he calls the \\"Savannah\\" which is an opposite maneuver--a high bet is placed, with the high-value chips concealed by lower-value chips, and if the bet loses, the high-value chips are pulled off. With that move, the winning bets are legitimate and surveillance tapes show that the high-value chips were there all along.<br /><br />The group also would occasionally make money with other scams, like \\"railing\\"--stealing directly out of the chip racks of their fellow players.  They also narrowly avoid getting involved in a card-marking scheme, violating their own rules of not using any specialized equipment that could be incriminating.<br /><br />The book is most interesting for the characters involved and how they dealt with \\"steam\\" from the casinos when they caught on to what was happening.<br /><br />The author appears to have no guilt or remorse for his actions on the grounds that casinos are regularly \\"stealing\\" from people every day (though that certainly doesn't justify the thefts directly from other gamblers, and ignores that gamblers are willing participants who know the odds are stacked against them).<br /><br />I read _Bringing Down the House_ about the MIT Blackjack Team about a year and a half ago, and the comparison between the teams is interesting--the MIT team's methodology was far more sophisticated (and wasn't technically cheating), but both had to use similar psychological techniques.<br /><br />It's surprising that the casinos didn't come up with better countermeasures quickly (a rule that there are no payouts for high-value chips not announced in advance, for example), but I find Marcus' overall tale quite plausible, in part because of the factors he points out in the last few pages of the book--\\"practically all casino jobs are monotonous\\" (p. 369).  The boredom results in lack of attention and the jobs' high turnover results in inexperienced people up against very experienced cheaters.technically cheating), but both had to use similar psychological techniques. <br /> <br />It's surprising that the casinos didn't come up with better countermeasures quickly (a rule that there are no payouts for high-value chips not announced in advance, for example), but I find Marcus' overall tale quite plausible, in part because of the factors he points out in the last few pages of the book--\\"practically all casino jobs are monotonous\\" (p. 369).

This is a compelling, novel-like story of the author's 12 years as a revenue officer in Collections for the Internal Revenue Service, from his initial recruitment by a classified ad that never mentioned who the employer was to being a hardened and efficient seizer of assets. Yancey tells a story of initiation into the IRS, office intrigues, taxpayer sob stories, and the shenanigans of tax protestors. Yancey took to his work, with which he had a love/hate relationship--mostly hate, at first, yet he kept with it and found motivation to stick with it and become the best revenue officer he could, for reasons he couldn't clearly identify. I found this book a surprisingly engaging read,  difficult to put down.
I picked up this book yesterday on the strength of Amazon.com reviews, and I finished it this morning.  I am very glad to have found Cory Doctorow's work, and am looking forward to reading Eastern Standard Tribe and anything else he writes.  If you enjoy the work of Rudy Rucker or Neal Stephenson (to whom homage is paid in a reference on p. 97), odds are you'll like this book.  Down and Out takes place in a time when death and scarcity have been defeated, money has been replaced with \\"Whuffie\\" which are credits based on reputation with others, and political power is managed by \\"ad hocracy.\\"  This is a light and very enjoyable quick read.
An extremely well-written detective story. The authors begin with a mystery to be solved -- what is causing the strange phenomenon of cattle mutilations in New Mexico? The story unfolds and the mystery deepens. The authors examine the claims with no ulterior motive or hidden agenda, looking at theories including UFOs, government conspiracy, and Satanic ritual killings. As they dig deeper, the evidence becomes clearer and clearer -- these are simply animals damaged by predation. The way this book is written, even a follower of Linda Moulton-Howe will be sucked into it and unable to refrain from reading through to the end. A great example of how skeptical investigations and reporting should be done.
A discussion of fraud in science that focuses on a few cases in detail, rather than surveying many. The funding process in particular is illuminating, and \\"following the money\\" exposes corruption. In the examples given, proposals are denied because of unsubstantiated rumors generated by research competitors, large money awards are made to institutions clearly less suitable because of bias and political reasons, and the NSF can actively try to cover these up. The topic of doctoring data is examined, particularly the David Baltimore and Stephen Breuning cases; the most disturbing aspect being the obstructionism of the institutions involved, to the extent of taking action against the whistleblowers. Fraud in drug and military research are also discussed. While some suggestions for dealing with these problems are included, this part is weak. This book is recommended, especially to those who think that science is always a self-correcting process.
An exposition of \\"the varieties of skeptical experience\\" as seen from the perspectives of skeptics, parapsychologists, and New Agers. The author presents an analysis of \\"the three cultures\\" with reference to the emergent \\"paraculture\\" as illustrated in the portrayals of the three types in current literature and especially in cinematic efforts to deal with the darker side of the paranormal, as in such movies as \\"Poltergeist\\", \\"Exorcist\\", etc. wherein the skeptic is usually the first to be killed off, resulting in some resolution between newage credulity and parapsychological wisdom. While the author's sentiments seem to lie with the parapsychological view, he does make a credible presentation of similar methodologies that are used by each camp to debunk/discredit the other, whether it be the \\"antagonistic\\" approaches of CSICOP or the \\"kinder gentler\\" methods of the parapsychologists. \\"... I see the New Age movement not as a new irrationalism but instead as a new expression of skepticism within a framework of religious or spiritual assumptions: a spiritual self-help movement or even a kind of religioscientific consumerism.\\"
Landsburg's book is entertaining and often witty, and written in a conversational, easy-to-read style. The book is very good at presenting often unintuitive and novel (to the non-economist) ways of looking at things. This is an invaluable book for pointing out common fallacies in arguments about deficits, inflation, unemployment, and other major political issues. At the same time, however, I can't help but think that Landsburg occasional misses significant relevant issues, most glaringly in the final chapter on environmentalism. For example, Landsburg describes a case where Jack wants a woodland at the expense of Jill's parking space and vice versa, and argues that the desires are exactly symmetrical. While environmentalists claim that the wilderness should take precedence \\"because a decision to pave is 'irrevocable'\\", Landsburg says \\"a decision _not_ to pave is _equally_ irrevocable\\" because \\"Unless we pave today, my opportunity to park tomorrow is lost as irretrievably as tomorrow itself will be lost\\" (p. 224). While this is correct, this misses the environmentalist's point that it is much easier to convert woodland to parking lot than to do the reverse. The environmentalist fears taking actions that are irrevocable in the sense that they cannot be undone in the future. Landsburg's perspective throughout the book seems to me to ignore the possibility of actions taken which may have consequences which may adversely effect the very existence of mankind (or economic institutions).<br /><br />Another example in the same chapter is when he suggests that the best way for environmentalists to support the existence of cattle is to eat beef: \\"If you want ranchers to keep a lot of cattle, you should eat a lot of beef\\" (p. 225). This presumes that environmentalists care about the number of cattle in existence, irrespective of their living conditions. Would Landsburg have told abolitionists during the Civil War to buy more cotton as a way of improving the plight of slaves?<br /><br />Yet a third example in the same chapter is about preservation of the Amazon rain forest, because a new species of monkey was discovered there in October 1992. Landsburg writes that this gives him reason _not_ to preserve the rain forest, since he \\"lived a long time without knowing about this monkey and never missed it\\" (p. 226). Would he make the same argument if it was a tribe of people whose existence depended on the rain forest rather than a species of monkey? If not, then he's missing the point of those who argue that animals (or the environment) have inherent value. It is clear from his writing that he disagrees, yet his own position does assign inherent value to the interests of people and so is not neutral. He seems to admit at the end of this chapter--in the letter he wrote to his child's teacher--that his view on environmentalism amounts to a religious view that is not subject to discussion (just as he thinks environmentalism itself amounts to a religion being inappropriately taught to his child).<br /><br />Despite my complaints, I found the book as a whole to be entertaining and informative, and would recommend it along with David Friedman's _Law's Order_ (I haven't read Friedman's _Hidden Order_) for insight into economic analysis of issues of the day.<br /> <br />Yet a third example in the same chapter is about preservation of the Amazon rain forest, because a new species of monkey was discovered there in October 1992.

I picked up this thin hardback as a remaindered item, and it was worth what I paid for it. The book is about corporate espionage (and the field of \\"competitive intelligence\\") by a journalist and a practitioner, respectively.  The bulk of the book tells the story of Victor Lee, an employee of the Avery Dennison company, who was the first person to be prosecuted under the U.S. Economic Espionage Act for selling company secrets to First Pillars, a company in his native Taiwan. The book's account of that case seems quite balanced, with due weight given to the defense (which ultimately failed, and apparently rightly so). This story is spread throughout the nine chapters (1, 3, 6, and 8 of the book's 9), in a somewhat disjointed fashion.<br /><br />The book also describes the founding of the Society for Competitive Intelligence Professionals and the competitive intelligence group at Motorola by former CIA analyst Jan Herring, a case where Schwann's obtained competitive intelligence via legitimate means to compete with Kraft in pizza manufacturing, another chapter on legitimate intelligence gathering by Teltech to find out about nanotechnology development of plastics for Dow, and a very different chapter on eEye \\"Chief Hacking Officer\\" Marc Maiffret.<br /><br />The book seems to have two voices about the ethics standards of SCIP, with co-author Barry thinking that the standards are hypocritical and rightly ignored, while it appears that Panenberg may be more sympathetic.<br /><br />There doesn't seem to be much in the book in the way of conclusions drawn in the book. It could have been more useful with a summary of methods to prevent espionage, more details on principles of legitimate intelligence gathering, or at least lessons learned from specific cases.
I had this book for several years, given to me as a birthday present by my wife along with Will Self's Great Apes (which I've also reviewed on Amazon.com), before finally getting around to reading it. I should have picked it up earlier. What starts out as a story of Matthew Chapman, great great grandson of Charles Darwin, traveling to Dayton, Tennessee to observe the annual re-enactment of the Scopes Trial becomes something more, the \\"accidental memoir\\" of the title. Chapman recounts some highlights and lowlights from his life, including \\"f-ing\\" himself out of an education and falling into a career as a Hollywood director and screenwriter, his relationship with his alcoholic mother. In the present, he interacts with a variety of interesting people in Dayton, Tennessee, who bend and in some instances break his stereotypes of backwoods fundamentalist Christians. An example of the latter is his \\"favorite creationist,\\" Bryan College creationist Kurt Wise, to whom Chapman devotes an entire chapter and part of another.<br /><br />Several chapters give a vivid account of the Scopes Trial itself, and Chapman gives references at the end for more comprehensive details. While the book does center around Dayton and the Scopes trial, the re-enactment doesn't become the planned centerpiece of the book when Chapman arrives too late to see it. He ends up speaking with the director of the play, and meeting some young Christians who are further examples of stereotype breaking, as he finds them to be quite cosmopolitan.<br /><br />In the end, Chapman doesn't end up too far from where he started from, but he indicates that he's willing to give up the term \\"atheist\\" for himself in favor of \\"agnostic,\\" and that his experiences in Dayton gave him a better appreciation for the multiple spiritual views endorsed by his Brazilian wife, Denise Texeiria.<br /><br />I found the book a quite enjoyable read, especially with my familiarity of creationism and the Scopes Trial. I recommend it.
Brian McWilliams has written an engaging behind-the-scenes look at the world of spammers and anti-spammers. The central focus is on an account of Davis Hawke, who went from running neo-Nazi websites from his college dorm room to running a major spam ring and becoming a fugitive from lawsuits. In parallel, he tells the story of anti-spammer Shiksaa and her attempts to get spammers to stop. Both are fascinating stories, and well chosen to represent the roles. Along the way, McWilliams tells us the story of Karen Hoffmann, an anti-spammer who ended up working for a spammer, of Scott Richter, well known from his appearance on The Daily Show as a \\"high-volume email deployer,\\" the Time Travel spammer, and others. There are brief appearances from top spammers Alan Ralsky and Eddy Marin, with the requisite and appropriate mentions of their criminal records.<br /><br />The accounts McWilliams presents show spammers to be essentially con artists, people who make a living openly flouting the law by selling products with deceptive and fraudulent claims, without a care for the damages they cause in the process. Some apparently deceive themselves, maintaining that they are helping people by giving them what they want, ignoring the costs they offload onto<br /><br />others in the process. Hawke comes across as an intelligent but sociopathic personality, manipulative of others and incapable of participating in any genuine human relationship.<br /><br />In the end, it's clear from the minimal penalties imposed by the law in the United States are not acting as a deterrent to this activity--the characters in this book appear, with only a couple of exceptions, to be undeterred. It remains to be seen if the criminal conviction of Jeremy Jaynes, who was sentenced to nine years of jail time, will be the first in a series of criminal prosecutions that will have some deterrent effect.
The difficulty with writing a book like this--a comprehensive look at security of applications, systems, and networks from the perspective of attacker and defender--is that it covers such a wide territory that it is impossible to touch on everything, let  alone go into great detail, and is almost instantly out-of-date.<br /><br />Peikari and Chuvakin have done quite well at presenting a book that offers something for beginner and expert alike, though it of course suffers from these flaws. The book is already out-of-date in a number of respects. The biggest such deficiency that I  noticed was in its coverage of denial of service attack tools,  which seemed to date circa 2001 (Trinoo, Tribal Flood Network, Stacheldraht), leaving out mention of the current scourge of bots and botnets.<br /><br />The book is unusual in its coverage of an issue that has not received the attention it deserves--application security--though it focuses only on reverse engineering and the writing of exploits such as buffer overflows. To be fair, the book's section of five chapters on software are under the heading \\"Software Cracking,\\" and aren't intended to be coverage of software flaws or secure coding (see Graff and van Wyk's book for an overview of that subject).<br /><br />The second section of the book is on \\"network stalking\\"--reconnaissance, scanning, fingerprinting, and includes  a thin and light chapter on social engineering (citing Cialdini's classic and highly recommended book Influence as well as Kevin  Mitnick's The Art of Deception, though the latter work is not  properly referenced).<br /><br />Part three is on \\"Platform Attacks\\" and covers Unix, Windows, SOAP XML, SQL Injection, and Wireless Security. This material isn't much different than what you'd find in the Hacking Exposed series.<br /><br />The final part is on \\"Advanced Defense\\" and includes chapters on analyzing logs, using IDS and honeypots, incident response, and forensics and anti-forensics. In some ways it seems like the authors were trying to do too much, and some of the chapters seem rather thin compared to more in-depth works on those particular subjects. The breadth, however, is quite impressive and unmatched by any other book on these subjects I'm aware of, while the depth is also greater than many security books. I recommend it as a good introduction and overview, to be supplemented by other works for further depth.nsics.

On a recent trip to Los Angeles, my girlfriend and I stopped by the Dianetics Testing Center on Hollywood Boulevard for a \\"free personality test\\" from the Church of Scientology. After spending about twenty minutes answering \\"yes,\\" \\"no,\\" and \\"don't know\\" to oddly worded questions about whether one enjoys inflicting pain on animals or frequently laughs at things no one else finds funny, we were both told that we had serious personality defects which Dianetics could correct. The brash, chain-smoking pregnant woman who did our post-test interviews was emphatic about that. We declined to spend any money, however, and left the Center to continue our walk down the star-studded sidewalks, where we observed a sign advertising the \\"L. Ron Hubbard Life Exhibition\\" on another Scientology building on the other side of the street. (Later on during our vacation, we noticed the Scientology Celebrity Center, which is presumably where such Church notables as John Travolta, Tom Cruise, and Kirstie Alley get their auditing done.)<br /><br />When I discussed our day's events with the friend I was visiting, he was reminded of a book he had recently read. He took it from his bookshelf for me, and I read it over the next couple of days.<br /><br />The book was Norman Spinrad's The Mind Game. It is the story of Jack Weller, director of a grade-B Saturday morning television show called Monkey Business (starring a chimpanzee) and his wife Annie, an aspiring actress. At the invitation of a friend they attend a social gathering at the Celebrity Center of a movement called Transformationalism. Jack hopes to schmooze and meet people he can use as stepping stones to an improved career, but Annie becomes more interested in Transformationalism and its founder, former science fiction writer John B. Steinhardt. At first Jack tolerates his wife's interest in Transformationalism and pays for her courses. But as she begins devoting more and more of her time to it, he becomes annoyed and pressures her to end her involvement with the group. Instead, the group issues Annie a \\"life directive\\" to either leave the movement or her husband, and she chooses the latter.<br /><br />Jack discovers that if he wants to see his wife again, he must successfully complete the Transformationalism education process and achieve \\"fully eptified consciousness.\\" Or, from his perspective, he must convince the Transformationalists that he has been completely converted to their way of thinking without actually becoming brainwashed in the process. To this end, he enlists the aid of a deprogrammer (or is he a reprogrammer?) named Garry Bailor.<br /><br />Jack undergoes \\"block auditing,\\" a process of diagnosis which creates a \\"psychomap\\" of the psychological blocks which prevent him from being Transformed; \\"meditative deconditioning,\\" a process which eliminates these blocks; and a \\"life analysis\\" by Gomez, a secretive and wily \\"Monitor,\\" a member of an elite class of Transformationalist overseers. Gomez knows that Jack is trying to fake the impression of conversion, but engages in tactics designed to make sure that in the process, Jack is genuinely changed. (The twists and turns of the psychological drama are somewhat reminiscent of The Prisoner TV series--Jack learns to manipulate lower level Transformationalists, who fear that he is a Monitor.) In the end, Jack's character does seem to be transformed, but not exactly in the way that Transformationalism intended.<br /><br />Spinrad's Transformationalism is clearly patterned after Scientology. Early in the book, Jack explicitly draws the comparison:<br /><br />  He had heard of Transformationalism, dimly. It was one of those consciousness-raising cults, like Arica, EST, or Scientology, of which he had a low and jaundiced opinion. (p. 5)<br /><br />Even descriptions of Transformationalism buildings are similar to Scientology's Hollywood centers:<br /><br />  The Los Angeles Transformation Center was a small converted hotel in Hollywood, just south of Sunset Boulevard and just west of Cahuenga, not too far from several studios. A fading tan stucco building eight stories high with a dirty red-tiled roof; a brand of cheap hotel common to the area. (p. 38)<br /><br />Spinrad's book offers a convincing description of social and psychological pressures that can lead people to conform to an unusual belief system. In the end, much is left unresolved, including whether there is anything really beneficial to Transformationalism or not. (For the most part, it seems clear that Spinrad's opinion of Scientology/Transformationalism is that expressed by Jack on p. 5. But there is also no question that Jack benefits from his exposure to the cult.) The book is an enjoyable and suspenseful journey into the world of Transformationalism, and could possibly also work as a vaccine against getting caught up in a group like Scientology.in Hollywood, just south of Sunset Boulevard and just west of Cahuenga, not too far from several studios.

James Mann's Rise of the Vulcans is a fascinating group history of six of the major players in the Bush administration's foreign policy: Dick Cheney, Donald Rumsfeld, Colin Powell, Condoleeza Rice, Paul Wolfowitz, and Richard Armitage.  Going to the back of the book, I see that Mann had first-hand input into his research from all of the above except Cheney and Rumsfeld, and the quality of the result is extremely high.  It is a sympathetic yet objective portrayal that gives no hint of its author's political views.  It points out arguments and evidence in support of Vulcans' views, as well as contradictions within them, such as Rice's published claim (in Foreign Affairs) that Iraq was no threat (p. 259) and the Bush administration's position on North Korea (p. 346).  It also points out conflicts between Vulcans' predictions and reality, such as Wolfowitz's prediction that America's allies from the Gulf War would all fall in line if the U.S. attacked Iraq alone (p. 237).  Mann also points out the clashes within the group, mainly between Powell/Armitage and the rest--with Powell going as far as to refer to them as \\"right-wing nuts\\" (p. 260, referring mainly to Cheney and Wolfowitz).<br /><br />The book is filled with fascinating details, such as Wolfowitz's prescient speech about a new Pearl Harbor, given as a commencement address at West Point in 2001 (p. 291), Bush's giving his OK to Pakistan's becoming a dictatorship (p. 300), the government's plan in the annual Nuclear Posture Review to use small nuclear devices to combat terrorism (p. 314)--which would seem to me to create more and bigger problems than it would solve, and Bush's nickname \\"Pootie Poot\\" for Vladimir Putin (p. 288).<br /><br />The book was published in 2004 and is quite up-to-date, only missing some minor recently uncovered details such as Rumsfeld's calling for an attack on Iraq on September 11, 2001.
John Horgan has written a wonderfully entertaining and informative account of his attempt to find who is productively applying science to the field of mysticism. One other Amazon.com reviewer said that they do not like this sort of book, which is based on interviewing individuals and commenting on their personalities as well as their ideas, but I personally prefer this approach as an introduction to the lives and works of others. I found the book to be very insightful, as Horgan always seemed to ask the questions and raise the issues that I was interested in hearing about. His open-minded yet skeptical approach is one I find refreshing.<br /><br />Horgan's subjects--Huston Smith, Steven Katz, Bernard McGinn, Ken Wilber, Andrew Newberg, Michael Persinger, Susan Blackmore, James Austin, Albert Hofmann, Stanislov Grof, Terence McKenna, Alexander \\"Sasha\\" and Ann Shulgin--are all quite interesting people. Horgan seemed most sympathetic to Blackmore, Austin, Wilber, McKenna (personality-wise more than idea-wise), and the Shulgins. He was--correctly, I believe--skeptical of Persinger after finding his pro-psi views. My own view of Persinger is that he attempts to fit everything into his temporal lobe epilepsy/tectonic strain theory views, but has often been unskeptical about the data he's pushing into the theory; I've never understood why skeptics like Blackmore and Michael Shermer have thought him to be plausible. (I've authored a critical review of Persinger's Space-Time Transients and Unusual Events for including bogus debunked events as items to be explained by his theory, and The Arizona Skeptic published an extensive bibliography of critiques of his TST assembled by Chris Rutkowski of the University of Manitoba in the July 1992 issue).<br /><br />In the end, Horgan is skeptical of all of his subjects, and thinks that they've missed out on the  importance of a sense of awe and wonder, as well as playfulness and fun (though McKenna seems to have had that down). I'm not sure I agree with Horgan on that--I thought that what most of these people seemed to have in common was being very comfortable (most seem to be wealthy, famous, respected, and living well) and being advocates of a quietistic conservatism that advocates being content with the way the world is. That's an easy position for someone who is comfortable to take. Horgan does touch on this subject briefly a few times, such as when he writes about \\"the nature does-not-care principle\\" and the problem of natural evil (pp. 192-194) and when he raises the issue of suffering with Austin (p. 131).<br /><br />Horgan seemed most at odds with Katz, a view I shared--Katz's views seem sheer unsubstantiated dogmatism, when he insists that drug experiences have absolutely nothing to do with mystical experiences, and in his insistence on a commonality between all forms of mysticism, which reminded me of the Bahai faith--a religion that disagrees with all other religions in arguing for the compatibility of all religions.<br /><br />In the end, I found myself scrawling notes of other books I'd like to read as a result of the references in this book: Austin's Zen and the Brain, Georg Feuerstein's Holy Madness, V.S. Ramachandran's Phantoms in the Brain, Francisco Varela's Sleeping, Dreaming, and Dying, Anthony Storr's Feet of Clay, and Rudolf Otto's The Idea of the Holy, as well as finding numerous references to other works that seem to me to be likely to be \\"on the right track\\" (Stephen Batchelor's Buddhism without Beliefs, Ronald Siegel's books on hallucinations and drug experiences).

Kenneth Bucchi has written a rather entertaining, though not entirely believable story of his work as an undercover investigator looking for drug dealers and other criminal activity among the employees of Boise Cascade's sawmill in Medford, Oregon. The book is written with a rather arrogant, know-it-all, morally superior attitude which is probably reflective both of the character Bucchi was trying to portray as well as his own ego. The book ends on a disappointingly preachy note as Bucchi tells one of the workers who he helped avoid legal consequences of his drug involvement to \\"Read your Bible and go to church ...\\" and goes on to talk about how he gave up his undercover career because of the non-Christian way it made him live. The evident pleasure he took in writing about the events of the book, however, reminds me of books by alleged ex-Satanists and CIA mind control victims, written for nominally religious audiences, but filled with tittilating details.<br /><br />  Bucchi's previous book, CIA: Cocaine in America, is allegedly based on Bucchi's experiences working for the CIA, but the CIA has denied that he ever worked for them, stating (as Bucchi also says in this book) that he was an aircraft mechanic for the Air Force, and also (as Bucchi does not say in this book) was discharged from the Air Force for being \\"delusional\\" (which Bucchi now says was essentially a frame up--though one for which he collects disability payments).<br /><br />  It would be interesting to see the result of a fact check against this book as a way of checking Bucchi's trustworthiness on his CIA book--my attempts to find out anything about 1980s or 1990s drug busts at Boise Cascade in Medford, Oregon via the Internet were unsuccessful, though I did find stories about the 1998 fire that burned it to the ground which Bucchi mentions in his Epilogue.<br /><br />  Script writers Douglas Cook and David Weisberg (\\"The Rock\\", \\"Double Jeopardy\\") sold a pitch based on Bucchi's book Operation Pseudo-Miranda (a revised and expanded version of his CIA book) under the title \\"Dixie Cups\\" in July 1999 to Atlas Entertainment, but no movie has yet come of it.tion Pseudo-Miranda (a revised and expanded version of his CIA book) under the title \\"Dixie Cups\\" in July 1999 to Atlas Entertainment, but no movie has yet come of it.
Like the previous reviewer, I am a fan of Fort who greatly enjoyed Damon Knight's biography as well as Fort's work.  I also found this book to be a wretched, worthless, and unreadable book of post-modern gibberish--I couldn't get past about the first 30 pages, though I did skim the rest, which appeared to have little to do with Fort.  If you would like more insight on Fort, I recommend Knight's book and the pieces that have been published on him throughout the years in magazines such as Fortean Times by authors such as John Michell, Mark Chorvinsky, and Mike Dash, which I cited in my entry on Fort in Gordon Stein's Encyclopedia of the Paranormal.
The common comparisons to The Da Vinci Code are apt only in that this is a mystery story regarding codes and a real-life document (in this case, Hypnerotomachia Poliphili; in the case of Dan Brown's book it's hoaxed documents about the Priory of Sion which were fabricated by Pierre Plantard and planted in the Biblioteque Nationale).  This book is a somewhat better novel with more substantial characters, but it's not a great book.  I bought it at an airport and read it during an international flight, and found myself with many extra hours to spare. I don't think it's worth buying in hardback--and unfortunately the British trade paperback edition I bought cost as much as Amazon sells the hardback for.
While books on this subject are now proliferating and this one doesn't bring much new information that isn't already circulating on the Internet, what Bamford does bring to the picture is his extensive knowledge of the U.S. National Security Agency.  Bamford makes the case that Bush's advisors had long wanted a war against Iraq, had previously tried to change Israel's political policy via consultation with Benjamin Netanyahu (who rebuffed them), but found a willing participant in Bush.  Bamford presents the case that Douglas Feith's secret intelligence group operated to politically manipulate intelligence information to make the case for war, and that the CIA was pressured to produce the desired results (\\"If President Bush wants to go to war, ladies and gentlemen, your job's to give him a reason to do so,\\" p. 334).  He reports on the Rendon Group, which may have illegally used government funds to propagandize the U.S. public.<br /><br />  Unfortunately, the book appears to have been something of a rush job and is poorly edited, with several duplications of text (e.g., NSA's \\"Mahogany Row\\" on pp. 19 and 103; a \\"whole different ballgame\\" quote on pp. 156 and 189).  I've seen some reviews that tout the fact that bin Ladin's satellite phone number is in the book--Bamford already published that information in the paperback epilogue of Body of Secrets, which also had an account of 9/11 as it pertained to the NSA. This book falls short of the quality of Bamford's previous books.
This is Krassner's third collection of drug stories, to go along with his collection of marijuana stories (Pot Stories for the Soul) and LSD stories (Psychedelic Trips for the Mind). This is a good collection of tales about experiences with magic mushrooms, ecstasy, peyote, mescaline, THC, opium, cocaine, ayahuasca, belladonna, ketamine, PCP, STP, &quot;toad slime,&quot; and others. The chapters on magic mushrooms and ayahuasca are pretty good-sized collections of interesting stories; many of the others are quite small. There are only a few that have quite the humor value of many of the stories in Pot Stories for the Soul, but I think this volume is a better collection than Psychedelic Trips for the Mind.
Coupland continues to impress me with his work, and I think this is quite possibly his best novel to date (I consider Girlfriend in a Coma the other contender).  It evokes some of the same emotions as All Families Are Psychotic, but without the implausible absurdities that occur in that story.  It all falls together in the end in some somewhat unexpected, but quite realistic ways--not so much in story as in character development.  This book is told in first person from the perspectives of four major characters, from 1988 to 2003, beginning with Cheryl, who is killed in a Columbine-style high school cafeteria massacre, then moving on to her boyfriend Jason, eleven years later. Jason's character is the most richly developed, and his section of the book accounts for over 100 pages of the book's 244, though the characters of previous chapters continue to echo through the later ones.  I very highly recommend this book.
This is not just a book about rats, but a book about exterminators, about diseases spread by rats and fleas, and about the history of New York City and some of its colorful characters, and even about the American Revolution.  It's a fascinating account of the author's project, inspired by an Audubon painting, to study rats in an alley near the World Trade Center, and how that project led him to learn about that alley, the hill it stands on, the surrounding buildings and the people who lived and worked there, and how the lives of rats and humans have intersected, there and elsewhere and elsewhen.  In some ways this book reminded me of Mary Roach's Stiff: The Curious Lives of Human Cadavers--it's a light and entertaining look at unpleasant subjects, made engaging through the author's skill at connecting the subject to others.
This is a marvelous book about the Professor, James Murray, the primary editor of the Oxford English Dictionary, and the Madman, Dr. William C. Minor, one of the Dictionary's most prolific contributors, despite his incarceration in an asylum for the criminally insane after committing a senseless murder provoked by his delusions.  The book tells the stories of each of these protagonists as well as the making of the OED itself, and nicely wraps up all of the connections, even to the point of showing what happened to the murdered man's family (whose widow visited Minor regularly<br />for months).
I agree with other reviewers who have suggested this not be the first Robbins book you read--start with Skinny Legs and All (my personal favorite), Jitterbug Perfume, or Still Life with Woodpecker.  This is a short and light book which I found to be entertaining airplane reading; it occupied me for about half of a Boston-to-Phoenix flight.  I agree with others who found Stubblefield's character and the ending to be somewhat of a let-down.  I enjoyed the tanuki parts the most--and have enjoyed myself perusing other information about tanukis on the web as a result.
A fascinating account of the spread of hysterical fears of being buried alive at multiple times and places in human history, with a common origin in both fact and legend.  What I found most interesting was the clash between the purveyors of irrational fears and the attempted refutations by incredibly poor skeptical critics (e.g., proponent Bruhier was more scientific than critic Louis), but the movement died out seemingly of its own accord. Bondeson does an excellent job of bringing together the relevant data from history, legend, medicine, art, and literature, into an entertaining and informative book, in some ways similar to Mary Roach's &lt;EM&gt;Stiff&lt;/EM&gt; but without quite that level of irreverence.
Randy Barnett has written a fascinating and well-argued book.  The book is composed of four parts:  &quot;Constitutional Legitimacy,&quot; &quot;Constitutional Method,&quot; &quot;Constitutional Limits,&quot; and &quot;Constitutional Powers.&quot;  The first part takes seriously Lysander Spooner's arguments in &quot;No Treason: The Constitution of No Authority&quot; that the Constitution is not and cannot be binding on people who did not explicitly consent to it- the &quot;we the people&quot; in the preamble is a fiction.  Barnett argues for a view that a Constitution can be legitimate and binding in the absence of explicit consent only if it incorporates appropriate limitations on government to safeguard individual rights.  This is the most philosophical section of the book, and I found it the weakest--while I think Barnett had good arguments against tacit or implied consent, I'm not sure his alternative really provides the legitimacy it purports to, nor am I particularly persuaded by his account of natural rights. (I am a strong proponent of individual rights, but I am unconvinced that they are grounded in nature, as opposed to being justified by a combination of empirical fact and subjective values.)<br />  In Part 2, &quot;Constitutional Method,&quot; Barnett argues that the Constitution is properly interpreted by a form of originalism based on original meaning, as opposed to original intent.  He argues persuasively that the arguments against originalism which target original intent do not work against original meaning.  I found this part much more persuasive than Part 1, and I think he has formulated a consistent and rational methodology of Constitutional interpretation that takes seriously what is written in the text.<br />  Part 3, &quot;Constitutional Limits,&quot; is where things start to get really interesting.  Barnett examines the judicial history of the &quot;necessary and proper&quot; clause of Article I, Section 8, and argues that the Supreme Court made a wrong turn way back in 1819 in McCulloch v. Maryland by adopting an expansive interpretation of this clause where &quot;necessary&quot; meant &quot;convenient&quot; and &quot;proper&quot; was virtually ignored.  He extensively reviews contemporary sources to argue for the meaning of this clause and that it requires judicial review of laws to make sure they are grounded in specific powers granted in the Constitution.  Barnett begins this section with a quote from Justice Clarence Thomas in FCC v. Beach Communications, showing that Thomas has bought completely into the view that there is a &quot;presumption of constitutionality&quot; for acts of the legislature, whereas Barnett favorably cites Justice Stevens' response to Thomas that &quot;judicial review under the 'conceivable set of facts' test is tantamount to no review at all.&quot;<br />  Barnett also argues that the &quot;privileges and immunities&quot; clause of the 14th Amendment was used incorrectly (too narrowly) in the 1873 Slaughter House cases, but the &quot;due process&quot; clause of the same Amendment was used correctly in Lochner v. New York in 1905.  He argues that both federal and state legislatures which act to limit the liberties of the people need to show that it is within the enumerated powers of Congress or within the police powers of a state, respectively, and otherwise overturned by the courts.<br />  Finally in this section, Barnett turns to the meaning of the Ninth Amendment, which reserves unenumerated rights to the people, and takes issue with Footnote 4 of the 1938 case United States v. Carolene Products.  The current methodology of the courts under Footnote 4, according to Barnett, is to begin with a presumption of constitutionality for acts of the legislature, unless there is a specific enumerated right in the Constitution that is violated, in which case the legislature must justify that violation.  The requirement of a specific enumerated right was then expanded in Griswold v. Connecticut by allowing additional rights not specifically enumerated, but found in &quot;emanations and penumbras&quot; from the other rights.  Barnett argues, by contrast, that the proper presumption is one of liberty, which can only be limited or regulated by justification from a specific power granted to Congress, or a police power granted to the states which does not eliminate any liberties or natural rights.  (E.g., a regulation can restrict time/manner/place of speech, but not content; speech itself cannot be prohibited on the basis of content without improperly infringing the right.)  Barnett gives an entire chapter on the presumption of liberty, and how to identify rights that have not specifically been enumerated.<br />  In Section 4, &quot;Constitutional Powers,&quot; Barnett looks at the commerce clause of Article I, Section 8, and argues that the Supreme Court went wrong with Gibbons v. Ogden in 1824 by equating &quot;commerce&quot; with &quot;intercourse&quot; and allowing Congress to regulate that in every case where it merely affects more than one state.  Barnett argues, again by citing a wide variety of contemporary sources, that &quot;commerce&quot; was distinguished from &quot;manufactures&quot; and &quot;agriculture,&quot; and was synonymous with &quot;trade.&quot;  Thus, Congress has no legitimate power to legislate regarding manufacturing and agriculture, only regarding trade between states, with foreign nations, and with the Indian tribes.<br />  He also includes a chapter on the police powers of states and what they can constitutionally do on his account, and another on the application of his view to judicial doctrines and cases. He argues that this yields something which is rather libertarian, but not entirely so.<br />  Barnett puts forth a position which takes the language of the Constitution seriously, and which would require us to be explicit about making changes to it when we find that it has become out of date, rather than allowing a flexibility to the language to such an extent that the original wording no longer has any meaning at all.  He spells out a view in which there is real content to judicial review, justified directly by the language of the Constitution, and in which the court has strong checks and balances against the legislature and the executive (and vice versa).<br />  This book deserves to be widely read and taken seriously by those in the judiciary.ticut by allowing additional rights not specifically enumerated, but found in &quot;emanations and penumbras&quot; from the other rights.

This book is an examination of the &quot;Wedge&quot; strategy of the Intelligent Design Creationists of the Discovery Institute, and how these creationists have substituted political maneuvering and propaganda for science.  While the Wedge strategy originally put forth specifically called for Phase I to produce &quot;scientific research, writing, and publicity,&quot; and the Fellows of the Discovery Institute claimed publicly that the scientific work was a prerequisite for the other phases of the plan, it is the scientific work that has still not even been begun, despite the passage of over a decade of time.  The other parts of the plan, however, have proceeded without the scientific prerequisites, and the creationists of intelligent design have taken their case (despite lack of any scientific ground) directly to the general public, to school boards, and to state legislatures.<br /><br />The book's chapters cover the history of the Wedge strategy, the content of the leaked Wedge document which set out that strategy, the results of scouring the scientific literature for any publications by Wedge advocates supporting &quot;intelligent design&quot; (none found), an examination of the intelligent design work of Paul Chien and Michael Behe, an examination of the work of Jonathan Wells and William Dembski, documentation of what the Discovery Institute has actually been up to (two chapters, and &quot;doing scientific research&quot; is conspicuously absent from the list), a look at the political efforts of the Wedge, and finally, documentation of the religious grounds and goals of the Wedge.<br /><br />This book shows the dishonesty and hypocrisy of the intelligent design theorists, using their own words to convict them.  This book should be read by anyone who advocates intelligent design creationism, or who thinks that it may belong in the school science curriculum (as opposed to university-level philosophy or social studies of science curricula).
Coupland's books are not for all tastes, and based on some of the other reviews here I see that some people's rankings of his books are almost exactly the opposite of mine.  I thought Girlfriend in a Coma was one of his most mature books, and quite possibly his best.  I preferred Shampoo Planet to Generation X, and found Microserfs slow and not up to the quality of his other books.  With that reflection of my tastes in mind, I thought All Families are Psychotic was of very high quality, almost as good as Girlfriend in a Coma.  Contrary to another reviewer, I did find significant character development in this book (especially on the part of Wade and Janet, whose relationships with the other characters changed from beginning to end).  Sure, there were some MacGuffins and deus ex machina, but it appears to me he's moving more into the Tom Robbins style--and he has always had a strong element of absurdity in his works.  I found this to be a very enjoyable quick read.
This is the single-best short introduction to atheism I've ever read.  Not only does it put together a very nice defense of positive atheism, it refutes most of the major misconceptions about atheism and lays the groundwork for atheist morality and meaning of life.  Extremely highly recommended.
Ronson, a British journalist and documentary filmmaker, has written a book that is hilarious and entertaining.  It's a sympathetic yet critical portrait of extremists ranging from crackpots like David Icke to Dr. Ian Paisley and Randy Weaver.  He spends time with the Ku Klux Klan, the ADL, \\"bin Laden's man in London\\" Omar Bakri Mohammed, and lets them speak for themselves.  What they all seem to have in common (except Weaver, who seems to have largely abandoned his conspiratorial views) is the belief that the world is run by a secret cabal that meets in a secret room.  Ronson takes their claims seriously, and tries to track down this cabal--and succeeds in infiltrating the Bohemian Grove accompanied by right-wing nutter Alex Jones (comparing Ronson's account to Jones' is quite hilarious), as well as scoring an interview with one of the founders of the Bilderberg Group and getting an account of what goes on at their meetings.  This book is highly recommended.
Honeypots is an excellent introduction to the subject of honeypots, useful as a reference for experts as well as for beginners to the subject.  It is written very clearly and provides step-by-step instructions with plenty of examples and screenshots.  It covers commercial, open source, and do-it-yourself solutions, from very simple low-interaction detection honeypots to very high-interaction research honeypots.  A CD-ROM is included with software and example data collected by honeypots.  One defect is a fairly large number of typos.
This is an excellent book that should be read by all software developers, script writers, system administrators, application designers, and system maintainers.  The book is short, to-the-point, and hits the important points as well as giving numerous real-world examples. It is easy to read, and not dependent on any specific software life cycle model or methodology--though it brings home the point that if you aren't following such a process, you'd do well to implement one.  This is a must-read and must-refer-to book that no organization that uses customized software or develops software in-house should be<br />without.
It is refreshing to see someone like Stossel with a large public audience take on the nonsensical policies and positions of both the right and the left, as well as to admit when he makes mistakes (unlike most of his targets).  He goes after corporate freeloaders like Archer Daniel Midlands that politicians of both major parties support; he points out the absurdity of regulations and lawsuits in the name of safety that cost more lives than they save.  I highly recommend this book.
A fascinating collection of photographs by Charles Eisenmann, a Bowery-based photographer of unusual performers. Mitchell purchased a large collection of the photographs knowing nothing of the photographer of his history, then did research for an initial version of this book in the late 1970s, which was published by a Canadian publisher. With the Internet, Mitchell was able to find out much more about the subjects of these photographs, and so this new edition has been published. Included are some relatively famous freaks such as Jo Jo the Dog Faced Boy (who is on the cover) and the &quot;Aztecs of Ancient Mexico&quot; Maximo and Bartola (exhibited by P.T. Barnum), but most are more obscure. They include a number of pinheads, fat men and women, bearded women, dwarfs and midgets, tattooed ladies, &quot;rubber skin&quot; men, human skeletons, and people with missing or deformed limbs. Mitchell includes a brief biography of Eisenmann, biographical information about the subjects where possible, and a histories of this type of photography and the Bowery area. I found the book to be well worth the rather inexpensive purchase price.
This is a very entertaining and interesting book about human cadavers--what happens when you die, the history of dissection, the University of Tennessee &quot;body farm,&quot; what dead bodies can tell you about airline crashes, how bodies are used for impact testing, flaws in Dr. Pierre Barbet's studies of crucifixion found by Frederick Zugibe, the process of &quot;organ recovery&quot; from &quot;beating-heart cadavers&quot; for transplants, the survival of severed heads (guillotine and transplantation), mummies and cannibalism, etc. Roach writes in a somewhat flippant style that somehow seems appropriate for the topic, it's never quite irreverent.<br />  My only complaint: p. 126: Roach seems to think that the FAA should force the implementation of safety measures that come out negative on a cost-benefit analysis (given the value of human life at $2.7 million, if shoulder harnesses save 15 lives over 20 years, that's not enough if it costs $669 million to implement). What she fails to recognize is the opportunity cost of such spending--$669 million spent to save 15 lives over 20 years could save thousands of lives if spent elsewhere instead. There is no infinite fund of money available to save lives at any cost.
This is a very easy-to-read and useful compendium of information about common forms of fraud<br />and how to protect yourself from them.  I've read numerous books of this type, and this is<br />the one I would recommend most highly today for being up-to-date and comprehensive.  Abagnale<br />often gives unsourced anecdotes, but there are several that I recognize from newspaper or<br />other accounts I've read.  My only real complaints with the book were that Abagnale says he uses<br />his children's birthdays for his PIN numbers (p. 149) which is bad advice given the ease<br />of obtaining birth certificates, his account of being the victim of credit card theft<br />over the Internet (pp. 151-153) doesn't seem entirely accurate unless he really did submit<br />his credit card number, and his statement about viruses arising from mere copying of legitimate<br />software (p. 176) is incorrect.  He also missed an opportunity to warn about fake escrow<br />sites (p. 162).  Apart from this, however, I think the book contains very valuable warnings<br />and advice.
I purchased and read this entertaining romp despite having skimmed it at the bookstore and reading this poor ad hominem argument:<br />&quot;After watching the way the worldwide media and the international community reacted to the question of Iraq's weapons of mass destruction, I don't think they'd see a smoking gun if you stuck it right against their foreheads.&quot; (p. 220)<br />I purchased it anyway, because although I think that's an incredible feeble aside (Mr. Ranum doesn't bother to say what smoking guns he thinks have been established, and it seems clear as of this writing that there are no WMDs in Iraq, and no good evidence that there were any post-1994), elsewhere in my initial skimming I saw what looked to be very interesting information about the Homeland Security Act and the USA PATRIOT Act.  Largely because of this material, I did find the book to be worth my time (if not quite worth the dollars I spent on it--I should have waited for a paperback edition).<br />The book is definitely a polemic, not a researched and referenced scholarly tome--there are no references or footnotes, beyond the suggested further reading material on pp. xvi-xvii.  There is much to disagree with besides the above example, as other reviewers here have noted.  It's short on conclusions and suggested remedies, though there are a few radical (i.e., politically impossible) suggestions, such as abolishing the INS and starting over from scratch (probably not a bad idea at all).<br />I recommend it for those interested in a lightweight, quick read to get a quick overview of the problems of securing an entire nation and the means that are being adopted with that alleged goal, but if you are looking for depth and detail, with solidly argued conclusions and recommendations, you'll need to look elsewhere.
This is the second fiction book in a row I've read in which Opus Dei and their practice of mortification of the flesh through a cilice has played a role (Tom Flynn's Galactic Rapture is the other). Dan Brown has taken the claims of Baigent, Leigh, and Lincoln's Holy Blood, Holy Grail and made them into a murder mystery novel, full of codes, enigmatic verse, and tales of the Priory of Sion, Knights Templar, and the bloodline of Jesus. It's an entertaining quick read which may also stimulate further research into some of these claims. (For the record, I think the notion that Jesus was married is somewhat plausible, but not substantiated; the stories of the Priory of Sion being carriers of Jesus' bloodline almost certainly false; the stories of an ancient time of peaceful pagan goddess worship are probably bogus--Brown seems to be relying on Riane Eisler's The Chalice and the Blade, a work of pseudohistory.)
This 1992 book by Kessler is quite similar to his more recent book on the FBI, but without the quantity or quality of interesting inside stories.  Not surprisingly, despite having excellent access to the CIA, there are fewer details.  Again, however, he comes across as remarkably fair-minded--quite critical of failings of the agency, and not afraid to point out flaws and foibles of its leadership--but also sympathetic, refuting some inaccurate charges that have been made.  The book has a very amusing and horrible typo in the title of Chapter 24: it is given as \\"X-Rated Chowder\\" in the table of contents, at the beginning of the chapter, and at the top of every page in the chapter.  In fact, it was supposed to be (as you learn when you read the chapter) \\"X-Rayed Chowder.\\"  A good introduction to the CIA, but it's now over a decade out-of-date.
I find it amazing that Amazon.com would give the spotlighted review position to a crackpot creationist who fails to substantiate his criticisms of this book.  This is quite unfair to the author of this book.
_Beyond Fear_ is a good book, and I'd put it into the &quot;should read&quot; but not &quot;must read&quot; category for people working in security (as opposed to _Secrets and Lies_, which I put into the &quot;must read&quot; category).  There's little new or profound in the book, which is essentially an elaboration with examples on the five-step process of analyzing and evaluating security systems given on pp. 14-15 of the book:<br />  1.  What assets are you trying to protect?<br />  2.  What are the risks to these assets?<br />  3.  How well does the security system mitigate those risks?<br />  4.  What other risks does the security system cause?<br />  5.  What costs and trade-offs does the security solution impose?<br />In the process, Schneier provides many interesting examples.  This is an excellent book on security for the layman.  But it is definitely a book targeted at a popular audience.  There are no footnotes or references, and Schneier occasionally tosses off remarks or asides that are questionable, if not false.<br />There are two significant flaws in the book:<br />1.  It exaggerates the subjectivity of a security evaluation.  On p. 17, chapter two is titled &quot;Security Trade-offs are Subjective.&quot;  But it's not the trade-off itself that is subjective.  It's not the risk assessment that is subjective.  It is people's non-instrumental desires (basic desires) or<br />values that are subjective.<br />Schneier writes (p. 17) that &quot;Different people have different senses of what constitutes a threat&quot;--but some are right and some are wrong. His distinction between perceived and actual risk shows that the important one is actual risk, not perceived risk.  Actual risk is objective, not subjective.  Schneier continues &quot;or what level of risk is acceptable.&quot;  That can certainly have a subjective component, but even subjective components can conflict with each other and be internally inconsistent, indicating a problem in the evaluation.<br />The final sentence of the chapter contradicts the chapter title: &quot;Because we do not understand the risks, we make bad security trade-offs.&quot; (p. 31) If the trade-offs were subjective, there would be no such thing as a bad trade-off, only a trade-off perceived to be bad by someone.<br />Later in the book Schneier contradicts the strong subjectivity claim (e.g., p. 249: &quot;Massive surveillance systems are *never* worth it.&quot; (emphasis added)) I don't think he seriously meant to make the strong claim--I think it's just careless/imprecise writing.  p. 259 seems to get it pretty much right, but he should really have found a philosopher to review this book--that a problem is intractable doesn't mean that the answer is subjective, nor does the fact that subjective interests enter into the picture mean that the answer, given those interests, is subjective.<br />2.  The book argues for an exaggerated egalitarianism--that anybody, regardless of background, training, or intelligence, can do security analysis.  At the same time, the book touches on some of the evidence that ordinary judgments are inaccurate, and that people are notoriously bad at estimating and comparing risks due to the natural use of heuristics like vividness, recency, etc. (the classic Kahnemann and Tversy book, _Judgment Under Uncertainty_, summarizes some of this evidence).<br />  It would be grossly mistaken to think that Joe Schmoe off the street is going to be capable of designing (or evaluating) the effectiveness of a complex security system, versus people with appropriate training and experience--just as mistaken as hiring people with no computer knowledge to build and maintain your IT infrastructure.<br />  Again, like in point 1, Schneier says things which contradict the strong hypothesis he seems to argue for, for example when he writes that wealthy people want doctors who treat others, not just standing by on 24/7 on-call for those wealthy people, because they want doctors who are experienced.<br />  And I think this is a good comparison--the position Schneier *should* be arguing for is that we should take responsibility for our own security in the same way that we should take responsibility for our own health.  We still need to rely on experts, but we should take an active role in consulting with them and evaluating what they tell us, especially since (just as in health care and medicine) there are people who know what they are talking about and those who are snake oil salesmen.xperienced.<BR>   And I think this is a good comparison--the position Schneier *should* be arguing for is that we should take responsibility for our own security in the same way that we should take responsibility for our own health.

Sullum addresses myths and misconceptions about drug use and abuse, compares the facts about illegal and legal drugs, and makes the case that there is such a thing as responsible use of illegal, as well as legal, drugs. This is a well-written and interesting book that covers the history of drug and alcohol prohibition, addiction and the consequences of drug use and abuse, and argues for moving to a more sane policy on drugs in the United States.  This would be an excellent first book to read on drug prohibition and why the &quot;war on drugs&quot; is foolhardy, after which the reader could move on to books like Hamowy's _Dealing with Drugs_.
This book depicts a future in which the Vatican has its own planet and has recognized the existence of Christs on other planets, reality television has evolved to three-dimensional, recordings of experience called &quot;senso,&quot; and a con man native to a backward planet is passing himself off as a divine figure. The story follows multiple convoluted threads which ultimately connect back in a cohesive whole; along the way are some historical details of Christianity, Catholicism, and Mormonism, and amusing and interesting extrapolations.  I'm looking forward to the sequel.
Al Franken has done it again!  What \\"Rush Limbaugh is a Big Fat Idiot\\" did to dissect Rush Limbaugh, \\"Lies\\" does, with far more devastating effect, to conservative pundits Ann Coulter, Bill O'Reilly, Sean Hannity, and Fox News, among others.  Franken exposes these pundits for their dishonesty and lies, and does so in a hilariously witty and irrefutable way.  This book urgently needs to be widely read, and the facts exposed by Franken spread far and wide.  We need more Al Frankens.
This is the second in a series of three books edited by Krassner collecting people's stories of their experiences with various drugs. The first, Pot Stories for the Soul, was about marijuana. This book was originally going to be called Psychedelic Stories for the Soul and the third to be called Magic Mushroom Stories for the Soul, but the humorless creators of the insipid Chicken Soup for the Soul series threatened legal action, and this book became Psychedelic Trips for the Mind and the third book will be titled Magic Mushrooms and Other Highs: From Toad Slime to Ecstasy. <BR>Of the first two books, the first is the most entertaining--it has the widest variety of stories and many of them are quite amusing, horrifying, or otherwise entertaining. This book contains more stories of countercultural figures--the first three chapters are on countercultural history, Timothy Leary, and the Grateful Dead. Krassner's contributions to this book have all previously been published elsewhere. <br />Other chapters include a whole set of people's stories about tripping at Disneyland, the obligatory chapter of bad trips (\\"Bummers\\"), which are often the most entertaining, and a chapter by prisoners.

This is a great collection of Paul Krassner writings, some of which have been turned into standup material on his recent CDs. While a number of the pieces in this book have been published elsewhere, this collecton is quite distinct from most of Krassner's other books, with the exception of a few stories that appear in different form in his autobiography (one of my favorite books of all time). I recently read Ronald Kessler's book on the &quot;secret history of the FBI,&quot; and was disappointed that he missed some of the FBI dirty tricks recounted in the first section of Krassner's book, &quot;The Federal Bureau of Intimidation.&quot; Other highlights of this book include the sections on Krassner's friends who have died (Jean Shepherd, Robert Spencer, Timothy Leary, Allen Ginsburg, Anita Hoffman, Terence McKenna, and John Lilly), a section of articles on the &quot;war on some drugs&quot; and the section on &quot;countercultural icons&quot; (Lenny Bruce, Abbie Hoffman, Jerry Garcia, Ram Dass, and Ken Kesey). Highly recommended.<br />On a side note, this book recounts a prank by Jean Shepherd that may have been the first instance of a &quot;flash mob&quot; (pp. 78-79).
This is a sympathetic yet hard-hitting account of the dirty underbelly of the FBI, which from its very founding has had corrupt leaders, dishonest dealings, worked as a secret police force similar to those of Russia and East Germany, engaged in dirty tricks campaigns, broken the law, and looked the other way while crimes--including murder--have been committed. Kessler has had remarkable access into the FBI and support in his research from many principals involved, and the book makes it clear that there have been some attempts--partially if not completely successful--to clean up the organization and make it respectable. FBI Directors Clarence Kelley, William Webster, and Robert Mueller come in for praise, but the other directors all come across as venal, corrupt, idiotic, or incompetent (the worst offenders being J. Edgar Hoover, William Sessions, Louis Freeh, and L. Patrick Gray). I highly recommend this book.<br />  One omission:  There were a number of dirty tricks by the FBI against the Yippies, including fabricating a \\"wanted\\" poster with a swastika and photographs of Abbie Hoffman, Jerry Rubin, Paul Krassner, and Mark Rudd, under the headline \\"Lampshades! Lampshades!\\", stating that \\"the only solution to Negro problems in America would be the elimination of the Jews.\\"  This poster was intended to create dissent between black radicals and the Yippies (and perhaps to result in assassinations of those pictured).  Also omitted was the approval by senior FBI officials under Hoover (Katha DeLoach and William Sullivan) to send a fake letter to Life magazine (under the name \\"Howard Rasmussen, Brooklyn College, School of General Studies\\") railing against Krassner, at that time editor of The Realist, calling him \\"a raving, unconfined nut\\" (which Krassner then used for the title of his autobiography).<br />I also thought that Kessler was a bit TOO sympathetic to the FBI at the end, when he unreservedly endorses the U.S. PATRIOT Act and gives short shrift to concerns by civil libertarians.libertarians.
This is an entertaining book, that provides useful and informative analogies for thinking about higher dimensions.  Unfortunately, Rucker has already written this book before, multiple times (e.g., _White Light_ and _The Sex Sphere_).  But fortunately, it's just as entertaining as ever, and perhaps a bit more polished.  If you want to *really* get into the higher mathematics, get _White Light_, which goes into more detail and looks at more philosophical puzzles regarding infinity as well as higher dimensions, and in which the main character has more of a mathematical background than Joe Cube in this book.
Actually, Tom--Barry and Dale are brothers, not husband and wife.
This is a thin hardbound volume, a collection of photographs and short<br />discourses about various aspects of dice, gambling, and fraud.  Each<br />chapter is very short (just a few pages) and the entire book can be<br />read in less than thirty minutes.  Both the photographs and the text<br />are fascinating, and left this reader wanting more.  I hope that Mr.<br />Jay will be writing more books to share his voluminous and interesting<br />knowledge of magic, gaming, and cons with the world.  (Jay's other<br />books: Learned Pigs and Fireproof Women and Jay's<br />Journal of Anomalies are also highly recommended.)
This book, while purporting in its subtitle to be a story of the argument that<br />ensued during the one and only meeting between Karl Popper and Ludwig Wittgenstein,<br />is much more than that.  It is an account of those philosophers' lives, the<br />major events in the world that affected them, and some of the details of their<br />views of the world and of philosophy and its significance.  I recommend this<br />book highly--it is a good introduction to these figures and their philosophical<br />views, which also touches upon the main views of the Vienna Circle and Bertrand<br />Russell.  It is written in an engaging way, and its descriptions of the philosophical<br />issues should be easily understandable even by those without a background in<br />the study of philosophy.
A pity this book is out of print.  I recently obtained a copy at a local thrift store, and it was more than worth what I paid for it.  In many ways Robin Quivers' book is more interesting than Howard Stern's two biographies--her path to the Howard Stern show was not the straight path that Stern himself took.  She worked in nursing, she went into the military, and she got involved with Werner Erhard-inspired self-help groups.  Her upbringing was in a lower or lower-middle class home where she was subjected to abuse.
Murray has written an immensely entertaining view of the development<br />of cellular telephone, the wrangling over FCC spectrum, the con artists<br />and hucksters, the visionary businessmen, the unprecedented methods<br />of haggling used to settle license ownership.  My own background gives<br />me familiarity with the Internet revolution; it was quite interesting<br />to compare and contrast the cellular revolution with it.  Those who<br />studied the cellular revolution were probably better able to understand<br />what was going to happen with the Internet than those who didn't.
I picked this up as airplane reading for my next trip, but ended up reading it beforehand.  I thought this was one of Grisham's better recent efforts.  Although one reviewer here thought the ending was poor, I thought it was well done and wrapped up nicely, though it was perhaps a bit abrupt.  (Nowhere near as abrupt as, say, Neal Stephenson's endings, however.)  If you liked The Partner (probably my favorite Grisham), you'll probably like this one,
What I find entertaining about stories of con-men are the cleverness or detail in their frauds.  Abagnale's scams are all the same--passing bad checks.  He occasionally does something a little clever--his printing of checks, his social engineering, his narrow escapes, and his escapade with the UofA coeds--but for the most part it's the same routine, over and over.  I was hoping to see some more variety.  Kevin Mitnick's book _The Art of Deception_ is more entertaining than this, as well as having much more practical value.  I also recommend the David Mamet film _House of Games_, _The Spanish Prisoner_, and the books on con games by Victor Santoro, Chuck Whitlock, and M. Allen Henderson over this one.
This is an entertaining collection of the \\"accidental wit and wisdom of our 43rd president,\\" but it is too lightweight to make a book.  This and its predecessor combined are perhaps worth a full book, but 87 pages with only a quote or two on each page is pretty much a ripoff at $ list price.  The whole book can easily be read while browsing at a bookstore.<br />In my opinion, if the cost of a book new is greater than the cost of photocopying it at a public copy machine ($/page), it's overpriced.  My suggestion is to read it at a library or bookstore, or purchase it used.
I picked up an autographed copy at Reagan Airport along with More George W. Bushisms; I finished both before my plane had taken off.  This book is somewhat meatier than the Bushisms book, and funnier as well, but doesn't compare to Franken's Limbaugh book.  The laughs don't come as often, and I can't really recommend it to anyone but a die-hard fan.  A much funnier book along the same lines is Ben Stiller and Janeane Garofalo's _Feel This Book_ (the audio version of which is better than the written).
Despite the length of this book (565 pages not counting the cast lists and index), I read it in just a few sittings over a few days.  The format is excerpts from interviews with the key participants, chopped up and arranged in chronological order, in most cases with the same events described from different perspectives placed next to each other.  This style allows the distortion of memory (or flat out dissembling) to become blatantly obvious (e.g., Fred Silverman's account of his response to Al Franken's \\"Limo for a Lame-O\\" sketch on p. 182 contrasted with Lorne Michaels' account immediately preceding it and Warren Littlefield's account immediately following it).  The personal filters are obvious as well in the accounts of Harry Shearer and Janeane Garofalo versus those of the others who were on the show with them.<br />  I highly recommend this book to anyone who's a fan of SNL or its writers or stars.  Seinfeld fans will want to check out the stories about Larry David's season as a writer on the show.
If you're looking for famous movie locations in the Los Angeles area that have been used in popular films of the last forty years or so, this is NOT the book to get.  The book does have lots of good photographs, but there is a strong emphasis on fairly obscure old films--Keystone Cops, Laurel and Hardy--and very old TV shows.  There are certainly some more contemporary films listed (e.g., the Bradford building interior used in Blade Runner; some Griffith Park locations used in many films, etc.), but I found it to be quite a disappointment, especially considering the high price for such a small book (no doubt because of the large number of photographs).  I found Tony Reeves' Worldwide Guide to Movie Locations and William A. Gordon's Shot on This Site to be more like what I was looking for, and at a better price.
Kevin Mitnick has put together an excellent book, that fills a major gap in the computer and network security literature.  The examples are realistic (I suspect more than one is a thinly-veiled example from real life) and clear depictions of the principles they illustrate.  The book is well-organized, and most importantly, it gives sound advice on how to defeat the social engineer.  The suggested information security policies at the end of the book are worth the price of the book all by themselves.  This is a must-read for information security professionals and corporate executives.  It is nice to see that Kevin Mitnick has returned something of value to the world.

My wife bought this book for me because she liked the cover.  I like it too, and think it looks rather like a simian Duane Gish (of the Institute for Creation Research)--do a Google image search and you'll see what I mean.<br />I don't think, as one reviewer wrote here, that the Zack Busner character is particularly based on Freud.  There is evidence early on that he is at least partially based on Oliver Sacks (his list of publications in the world of chimps has titles very much like those of Sacks' books, and his intimate relationships with his patients are similar to Sacks' style).
This book, published in 1988, was shown to be almost entirely fabrication by an investigative report published in 1990 in the Christian magazine Cornerstone (copies of this article have circulated the net). The book was reissued in July 1991 by a different publisher: Pelican Publishing Co., a small Louisiana publisher. This new edition features cover blurbs from such people as Hal Lindsey and Johanna Michaelson (who helped get the book published in the first place, but who I thought accepted the Cornerstone criticisms) and Mike Warnke (whose claims of being a &quot;former Satanist High Priest&quot; have also been shown to be false by Cornerstone).<br />What is most galling about the new edition of the book, however, is its afterword, by three Los Angeles clinical psychologists, all women sporting either an M.D. or Ph.D. after their names. The two-page afterword does not address *any* of the Cornerstone criticisms, but alludes to them by saying that (paraphrase) &quot;some critics state that this book should not have been published unless every single fact within it could be verified and documented.&quot; It goes on to say how unreasonable these critics are, and that numerous other people have reported stories &quot;like&quot; Lauren Stratford's. I suspect that the &quot;some critics&quot; referred to do not exist; that no one has made any such claim about Stratford's book. The Cornerstone criticism thoroughly documented the fact that the book is almost entirely a fabrication by Laurel Wilson (the real name of &quot;Lauren Stratford&quot;), a very disturbed young woman whose story has changed radically over time.<br />Surely both the publisher and these clinical psychologists must be aware of the details of these criticisms. To go ahead and republish the book is the height of irresponsibility.
While short and fairly entertaining, the author seems to be more impressed with himself than he should be.  Many claims are totally unsupported generalizations; the perspective is similar to that given in The Satanic Bible, but I'd say that LaVey said it better and more explicitly.  Other similar perspectives may be found in Colin Wilson's writings on crime and the criminal mind.
I read this or another Mary Relfe book with the same premise--that UPC codes are the Mark of the Beast and contain a hidden &quot;666&quot;.  Her analysis fails to actually comprehend how UPC codes work, and misconstrues the start, stop, and middle separator bars as encodings of 6, which they aren't.  An article in the Skeptical Inquirer many years ago covered this issue and accurately explained how the UPC codes work.
Highly entertaining, absurd rubbish.  You can read summaries of both this book and &quot;Brice Taylor&quot;'s (Susan Ford) _Thanks for the Memories_ (omigosh!  They corroborate each other!) in Adam Parfrey's _Apocalypse Culture II_.  If you thought the Meese Commission report was hilarious, if you think Texe Marrs and David Icke are absurd to the point of humor, then you might like these, too.<br />If you believe these tales, though, I suggest you seek professional help in the form of a critical thinking class at your local college or university.
A remarkable collection of stories of abuse, betrayal, rape, dishonesty, egos in collision, ridiculous dogmatism, and mindless cultism that people have experiences within Alcoholics Anonymous and other twelve-step groups.  It is clear from these stories that while AA may help some people, it also can promote considerable harm.  Story after story recounts cases o counselors and sponsors who abuse their position to their own advantage or to cause harm.  Highly recommended.  (I also recommend Charles Bufe's _Alcoholics Anonymous: Cult or Cure?_, now in a 2nd revised edition.)
McWilliams states up front that &quot;This book is based on a single idea: You should be allowed to do whatever you want with your own person and property, as long as you don't physically harm the person or property of a  nonconsenting other.&quot;  While it follows from this principle that there  should be no prosecution of &quot;consensual crimes,&quot; this principle  itself is badly flawed.  First, it is a consequence of this principle that  there can be no laws against attempted but failed crimes so long as no harm  is done in the attempt.  If I shoot a gun at your head and miss, and the  bullet hits my own house, then I have neither physically harmed your person  or property, and thus done nothing that I should be disallowed from doing  under this principle.  Likewise, various kinds of negligent and reckless  behavior with a high likelihood of causing physical harm cannot be  prohibited, only that which actually causes harm.  Drunk driving is fine,  so long as you don't physically hurt anyone or their property in the  process.  Building a nuclear warhead in your basement is fine, so long as  it doesn't detonate or irradiate the neighbors.  The principle also would  entail the invalidity of intellectual property.  If I take a copy of  McWilliams' copyrighted book and make a photocopy with my own materials, I  have not physically harmed his person or property, though I have diminished  the value of his intellectual property.  While I agree with McWilliams  that many, if not all, &quot;consensual crimes&quot; should not be illegal,  the foundation for that position is not to be found in quite the principle  he gives.
This book is certainly worthy of its title.  It is a book by an English professor that completely dismisses everything in 20th Century Anglo-American philosophy in a single sentence in order to focus on  post-modernism and New Age thought as the culmination of philosophy.  Complete rubbish, worse even than the cartoon book &quot;Philosophy for  Beginners&quot; (which at least gets right most of what it does say, but  has the same blindness towards analytic philosophy as &quot;The Complete  Idiot's Guide&quot;).  Get something else, like Joel Feinberg's  &quot;Reason and Responsibility&quot;, Robert Nozick's &quot;Philosophical  Explanations&quot; or &quot;The Examined Life&quot;, or Keith Lehrer's  &quot;Philosophical Problems and Arguments&quot; (primary author James  Cornman).
Jerry Clark has demonstrated himself to be the leading historian of  UFOlogy with the two editions of his UFO Encyclopedia.  These hefty volumes  pretty much cover the bases, with plenty of documentation for further  study, and are a useful resource for those who have already taken a  position (no matter what it might be) on the UFO issue as well as those who  are undecided.
Contrary to the previous reviewer, the book is extensively documented with  references to the work of leading hypnosis researchers (especially ch. 3,  &quot;Hypnosis: Recent and Contemporary Views&quot;).  The book has its  flaws (search for &quot;Robert Baker&quot; on the web to find some of  them), but this is an excellent introduction to the subject.
Brown's book is superficially more scientific than most creationist works, but closer inspection shows that he routinely ignores contrary data and repeats creationist claims that have been thoroughly debunked even within the creationist literature (such as the moon dust and shrinking sun arguments for a young earth).  Brown is a skillful debater and good at preaching to the choir, but often ignores criticisms that refute his claims while continuing to repeat them.  His work has been critiqued in the _Creation/Evolution_ journal, the _Creation Ex Nihilo Technical Journal_ (creationist publication).
I wish I had read this book a year (or more!) ago.<br />The methods are quite simple, yet effective in<br />stopping emotional manipulation and making others<br /> be more assertive with you as well as improving your own ability to assert yourself.
This book is an excellent summary of theories of hypnosis<br />with an emphasis on criticisms of state theories.  The<br />author argues for social/cognitive non-state theories.<br /> The book is marred only by the fact that many passages<br /> are lifted directly from the authors being summarized,<br /> without being noted as such.
