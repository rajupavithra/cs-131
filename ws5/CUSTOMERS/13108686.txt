I wrote the 2-star review below but it was for another book. Somehow, since I was writing a review for a couple infertility both books (I read them all!), a review I wrote for another book ended up here... the wrong one ended up here! (see below)  <br /> <br />So let me try again!  <br /> <br />I love this book -- What to Do When You Can't Get Pregnant IS THE infertility book, at least for me. I like the easy to understand quality of writing and the way it breaks information down in understandable terms. I like all the tips and the questions to ask a doctor or your partner. And I wish I had known about cervical mucous and old eggs before I had read about it in this book. I would recommend anyone trying to conceive check out this book! <br />
After reading all these reviews, I bought the book thinking I was buying THE infertility book must-have. It's OK. Not great, not bad, but not what the hype here led me to believe. I'll keep it in the library, but I'll be more careful about buying based on reviews here.
