Listening to this very well done audio book I immediately wrote a letter to Vice President Al Gore. Warning: This book will horrify you with regards to the maliciousness of the Republican Department of Justice in the early 1990's.<br />Vice President Gore  I have just been listening to a very disturbing audio book called, Tyrannosaurus Sue : The Extraordinary Saga of the Largest, Most Fought over T-Rex Ever Found.  The book is about a real story which involved some palentologists who unearthed a T-Rex and the malicious attempts of a manipulated Republican Justice Government division to destroy not only the palentogists livelyhood but their company which endevoured to save and restore dinosaur fossils.<br />I would like the United States to pass a policy which would allow the collection of dinosaur bones for both profit and non-profit enterprises from Federal and State lands for the intended purpose of science, preservation and display.<br />I have never been so angered by the abuse of perceived justice by the United States as I have heard in this case.  It made me sick to hear how manipulated Republican Justice Government officials (Kevin Schaffer) could use the cloak of the law in such a malicious, vendictive way.<br />By passing a policy which would allow for the collection of dinosaur bones for both profit and non-profit enterprises from Federal and State lands for the intended purpose of science, preservation and display, the above injustice in the Tyrannosaurus Sue will not happen again.<br />It should not be a crime in this country to make a profit from earning a livelyhood and it definitely shouldn't be so in the case of palentogists, especially if they find the fossils on Federal or State owned/controlled Government land.<br />Arnold D Yoshida-Veness
This is an interesting story about the youngest astronaut Gordon Cooper whom I really wasn't aware of until his audio novel. I love reading about astronauts and their adventures. I was equally intrigued about his candid UFO experiences and those of other pilots who had confided in him, sharing their own experiences.  The space connection with Valerie Ranson and her interest in Nikola Telsa's work was a surprise when I got to it. The description of the UFO and how it uses the force around it to produce a Gravitational force drive was great! I mean why not. The solution to funding the Advanced Technology Center is really quite straight forward, write books about your work, findings, connections, just like this book and audio tape.  The Tesla tower and how to finance it is a no brainer. Incorporate cell phone technology into the chips which receive the power.  No company will build something for free, but they will love to make money off something which is very affordable to produce. Bill the user on per use basis. Imagine electric cars of the future not requiring batteries at all. Instead the automobile industry bills the user on their power consumption received from the Tesla towers they have erected around the country. Power shifts from the Oil industry to the Automobile industry. Automobile profits go through the roof! Result - no more vehicle air pollution in twenty years. Don't be sad about the length of time to introduce new technologies. It takes one complete generation to effect change. In order to make the change though the young must be educated with it. For instance I've been raised on the notion of UFO's and extraterrestial life since I was born (Star Trek etc). They could fly in tomorrow and I wouldn't be surprised in the least. To encourage people to learn about your ideas, write about them constantly.  Challenge people to learn new and wonderful ideas. If it can be imagined humans will eventually create it.<br />Please remember if you write a book makean audio edition too.<br />This is a great book and I recommend it 100%. Keep an open mind though.
Congradulations to the Star Trek team and William Shatner for putting  together a really fun and interesting Star Trek adventure. In the past I  have been highly critical of the Star Trek books coming out because they  have been very dark adventures. They were not much fun and there was a lot  of unnecessary violence. Simon and Schuster listened to the feedback and  the results are in. THIS IS A GREAT STORY that leaves you continuously  guessing. Where is the story going to go next?  Unnecessary violence is  gone, positive story line, great heros and lots of adventure. It doesn't  get any better! I highly recommend the audio novel.  William Shatner does a  fantastic job of narration and the audio team does a great job bringing it  to life.  Excellant work all around!  I'm really looking forward to William  Shatner's next Star Trek novel.
I would like to thank Patrick Moore and his artist Tom Doherty for bringing the stars to life in this excellant childrens book. Since my son was born I have taken a picture of him and his Dad reading it each and every month on the 12th.
What better way to share your enthusiasm of science and physics with your kids than with Richard Feynman's audio physics lectures. Since I started playing them for my six month old son, we have gradually gone through each  of the series. In the beginning I had been a little critcal of Richard  Feynman. Who was this gravelly voiced man? It's kind of like saying who's  Albert Einstein? Well my knowledge grew as both my son and I listened to  Richard Feynman and learned not only about this amazing man but also about  his love of learning.<br />I can't thank the team enough who has taken the  time to put this series together. It is so valuable! So predominate is  Richard Feynman at bedtime now that the physics audio lectures are now  referred to as Grandpa Feynman's bedtime stories. My son is now 25  months.<br />I highly recommend these audio physics lectures and  enthusiastically encourage more physics, science, geology, astrophysics and  biology.<br />Edutainment does not get any better than this. Discover Richard  Feynman and discover the amazing world around you!<br />Thank you Arnie and  Reid

I thoroughly enjoyed this unabridged audio novel about Jim Clark and his eccentric personality. As a programmer in the Valley and living only five minutes away from SGI and Netscape it was really interesting to learn more about the founder and Venture Capital of the Valley.<br />I really enjoyed how  Brillance Audio did the unabridged novel. Dubbed to six tapes it was really  fun to listen to the whole story, while I programmed at home. As a  developer I don't have any free time to read but I have hundreds of hours  to listen to audio novels, especially good ones like this.<br />I really feel  for Jim Clark though, being the conceptulist of the new new thing is tough  work and frustrating. I'm looking forward to the day when he gets so upset  with the local TV that he creates five 24 hour education channels, One for  math, physics, science, biology and geography that air the  videos and some new ones. (I'm a little eccentric  too)<br />I look forward to Michael Lewis's next novel and hope it is as  enjoyable as this one. Great narration by Bruce Reizen.
This feedback is for the publisher.<br />I would like to see this book converted to an unabridged audio version. I do not have much time in my busy schedule to read but would love to listen to it while in my car. <br />(I  have recently purchased the unabridged version Michael Crichton's novel  Timeline on 9 cassettes and thoroughly enjoyed it.)<br />If the story, Genesis  : The Story of Apollo 8 : The First Manned Flight to Another World, could  be narrated to audio it would be greatly appreciated. Cassettes or CD
There is nothing more I love to share with my young son, than a bedtime story about a real American hero. I'm so happy that John Glenn took the time to write down and narrate his story for his grand kids. My young son  now 23 months is enjoying his tapes as a bedtime story too. Hard work,  honesty, love, patriotism, sacrifice and dedication to do a job well, what  more could you ask for in a story. When John Glenn flew into space in Oct  1998 I couldn't wait to get my son the NASA Mission Patches from Mercury 7  and the Shuttle Flight for his jumpers. He wears them proudly today. I hope  more astronauts take John Glenn's lead to tell their stories. They may or  may not be big sellers but they are very important stories which a special  group of people would love to hear.
This is the kind of novel that you seriously wonder why it was ever printed and wonder even more why they wasted the money to move it to audio other than to scam the general public. By the end of side two of tape one I  ejected the story and threw it away. <br />It's work like this that will  destroy the Star Trek Franchise. Peter David and John Delancie should never  have been allowed to publish this work and its a serious crime that Simon  and Schuster did.<br />The Star Trek franchise needs a new breed of young  exciting authors to carry on the dynamic adventures of Star Trek and the  heroic adventures of Jean Luc Picard and Captain James T Kirk.<br />It's  apparent from this book that the authors are going through some pretty  serious personal problems and I for one don't want to listen to it.
What is it with Star Trek writers, that they feel a need or maybe its a secret urge to have to include some graphic violence into their story line for it to be successful. As a long time fan this is the last Star Trek  novel and audio novel I will ever purchase. I would like to send a loud  clear message to Simon and Schuster and especially to the current Star Trek  writers that this type of writing will not be tolerated. That's the bad  news. The good news is that the audio engineering is superb and has  increased considerably since Star Trek Pathways. John Delancie does an  excellant job with this script! He is extremely enjoyable to listen too.   So with regards to audio engineering, the team is now easily on par with  Star Wars X-Wing. Unfortunately stricker guide lines need to be set down  for the writing team. I will no longer support your work.
After a scathing review on the Pathways audio novel I would like to commend the audio engineers for their outstanding work on this Star Trek audio novel. The space battles are fantastic! But it is also all the other  small nuances which add to the realism of this book. I really enjoyed the  extra detail. That's the good news. The bad news is that this Star Trek  audio novel continues on the trend towards more and more violence, and I  don't like it. It has gotten so bad that I would prefer not to support the  Star Trek series anymore. Star Trek is about adventure, solving problems,  doing good, pushing the envelope of danger. The graphic scenes of suicide  and cutting open ones neck leaves me cold. I would love to have shared this  novel with my young son, but those elements of the story line are horrific.  My message to the current writing team is simply this, clean up your act  and reduce the graphic violence or find yourself out of business. These are  not the elements I want in a story and I want them removed! The story line  is great but is ruined by the violence.
Sept 23, 1999<br />First and foremost I would like to thank Homer and Simon Schuster books for abridging this book to audio.  It has allowed me to share this fun shuttle space adventure with my young son (now 21 months  old) as one of his betime stories.  Four tapes was the perfect length! (One  tape per night for a week.)<br />I became aware of Homer and his work after  thoroughly enjoying the movie October Sky.  When he released &quot;Back to  the Moon&quot; I immediately picked up the audio novel so I could enjoy  another great space adventure with my son.<br />Homer Hickam didn't disappoint  and now our family looks forward to his next shuttle adventure!<br />(I would  really like to see each of the shuttle adventures narrated into a story  line, especially the new ISS ones. I'm interested in hearing about the hard  work, triumphs, letdowns, and the hurdles that shuttle crews go through in  order to succeed. Narrating to audio is a must so my young kids can enjoy  them too. I'd like them to learn that hard work and perservance really does  pay off, through the vehicle of shuttle adventures.  A little science  thrown in for good measure wouldn't be so bad either!)<br />Thanks Homer
August 18, 1999<br />After spending a good part of the last month listening to Richard Feynman's Physics lectures 1,3 and 4 I would like to raise my rating for these tapes to 5 (the highest possible).<br />Richard Feynman can  really grow on you as you become part of his Physics class of 1961 - 1962.  The audio level is well maintained throughout the series which was a  problem in some of his earlier audio books.<br />I look forward to the  University of Berkley California extending this Physics series continuously  into new exciting topics.<br />For the Physics faculty who may be following  these notes the tapes are used nightly for my 19 month old sons bedtime  stories. Two hours a night, every night. <br />If your going to listen to  something you might as well learn something interesting.<br />Thank you for  creating this valuable series.<br />Arnold D Veness
August 2, 1999 I would like to take a minute to thank Timothy Ferris for abridging, Coming of Age in the Milky Way, to audio. Shortly after my son was born I began looking for audio novels which would allow me to share my  passion of astronomy, physics and astrophysics with my then six month old  son, The Coming of Age in the Milky Way, was perfect meeting all the  criteria. Timothy Ferris also gets top marks for announciation, his  speaking is very clear and easy to understand. It is because of his  outstanding work that I decided to purchase his other audio novels, The  Whole Shebang and The Red Limit: The Search for the Edge of the  Universe.<br />That was 11 months ago. All of Timothy Ferris audio novels  turned out to be excellent with a high standard of quality in production.  What started off as a casual experiment with audio bedtime stories for my  son has now become firmly entrenched as a nightly event. My son now 18  months old, has moved onto the Richard Feyman Physics audio lectures which  are also carried by Amazon.<br />I would like to encourage Timothy Ferris to  continue produce more of these types of edutainment audio programs on tape  or CD. I love listening to scientific books on my way to work and also love  to share them with my 18 month old son as his bedtime stories. In addition  to the content, the high level of clear announciation in the Timothy Ferris  work is great, it really helps my son to learn new words, concepts and the  organization of the english language. More than he would ever obtain in  normal everyday speech.<br />I would love to see the following subjects  abrigded to audio for distribution through Amazon.com. Maths, sciences,  physics, astrophysics, geology, any and all space related topics, gravity,  unified field theory, electromagnetics, electronics, microproccessor  design, optics, micro-optics, electro-optics, light and the theory there  of, satellites, satellite orbital mechanics and related theory,  engineering, chemical engineering, civil engineering, electrical  engineering.<br />I do not have time in my busy daily schedule to read very  much, but do I have five hours a day to listen and learn.<br />If you make it  I will support it.<br />Arnold D Veness

July 16, 1999<br />I first became aware of James Burke work through the Discovery/TLC channels and when I stumbled across his audio novel Connections I had to try it out. Connections was great and so I was  encouraged to try out his other audio novels, The PinBall Effect which were  just as ingenious and entertaining.<br />The quality of James Burke's work set  the stage for what has become a new age in bedtime stories.  My new born  son then 3 months was quickly introduced to the art of the audio novel as  his new bedtime stories.<br />Its been well over a year now after several  dozen audio novels the little guy has now turned 18 months old.  The very  creative story of The Pinball Effect still gets a replay every few months  and he enjoys it every time.<br />The only sad part about the James Burke  audio novels is that I haven't seen a new one in a very long time.<br />I  highly recommend this creative story about history and the connections  which brought us to where we are!<br />Arnold D Veness

July 12, 1999<br />First and foremost thank you for producing this initial release of Richard Feynman's Physics lectures.<br />I am a total fan of Richard Feynman's series of Physics lectures and enjoy them both for their  knowledge and historic value but ...<br />I would really like to see a  transcript made of this audio lecture and have it reproduced by a  professional narrator like Jeff Riggenbach who has done work for audio  scholar. Jeff Riggenbach's work is excellant! Listen to T-Rex and The  Crater of Doom as one example.<br />I would repurchase all of the Richard  Feynman Physics lectures done to date if this could please be done.  The  current tapes are OK but the sound quality and announciation could be so  much better.<br />Please work with Audio Scholar if necessary to realise this  new release and please continue producing advanced audio physics lectures.  I would like your company to continue where Richard Feynman left off.<br />I  use the tapes as audio edutainment on my way to work and as bedtime stories  for my 18 month old son who has been listening to Richard since birth. I  have allocated a budget of $1,000 a year for advanced audio edutainment  like this.  If you create it I will support it.<br />Arnold Veness

July 8, 1999 I would like to take a minute to thank Audio Scholar for abridging this novel to audio.  I much prefered having a professional speaker narrate the book as previous Richard Feyman products I have  purchased have really lacked in sound quality (they were not Audio Scholar  products).  I thoroughly enjoyed the abridged audio novel as did my 18  month old son who gets to listen to them to as his bedtime stories.  I  would like to encourage Audio Scholar to produce more of these types of  edutainment audio programs on tape or CD.  In many instances I wouldn't  mind seeing the programs extend to 4 tapes or CD's. I love listening to  scientific books on my way to work and also love to share them with my 18  month old son as his bedtime stories.  Actually I initially started buying  them for my son and then got hooked on them myself.  Why should my 18 month  old son get all the good stuff to listen too! My budget for this type of  audio edutainment has sky rocketed from $100 a year to $1,000 a year due to  the high level of quality of the Audio Scholar work.  The more science and  physics books abridged the better. I would love to see the following  subjects abrigded to audio for distribution through Amazon.com.  Maths,  sciences, physics, astrophysics, geology, any and all space related topics,  gravity, unified field theory, electromagnetics, electronics,  microproccessor design, optics, micro-optics, electro-optics, light and the  theory there of, satellites, satellite orbital mechanics and related  theory, engineering, chemical engineering, civil engineering, electrical  engineering. I would also like to encourage Audio Scholar to pursue the  rights to abridge Michio Kaku's books to audio as well. I do not have time  in my busy daily schedule to read very much, but do I have five hours a day  to listen and learn. If you make it I will support it. Arnold D Veness
I would like to take a minute to thank Audio Scholar for abridging Relativity to audio.

I would like to  encourage Audio Scholar to produce more of these types of edutainment audio  programs on tape or CD. I love listening to scientific books on  my way to work and also love to share them with my 18 month old son as his  bedtime stories.

In addition the high level of clear  announciation in the Audio Scholar work is fantastic, it really helps my  son to learn new words, concepts and the organization of the english  language.

July 7, 1999 I would like to take a minute to thank Audio Scholar for putting together this audio novel which consists of 4 essays on the theories of the Universe.  I thoroughly enjoyed it as did my 17 month old  son who gets to listen to them to as his bedtime stories.  One night he  kept me up until 2am until I turned the tape back on!  Normally he just  gets to listen from 8 - 10pm. I would like to encourage Audio Scholar to  produce more of these types of edutainment audio programs on tape or CD.   In many instances I wouldn't mind seeing the programs extend to 4 tapes or  CD's. I love listening to scientific books on my way to work and also love  to share them with my 17 month old son as his bedtime stories.

What is creativity? I owe an apology to Audio Scholar for my first review.  I should have finished listening to the whole whole audio novel before saying anything the whole work.  My first review only pertains to essay 1  on tape 1. After abandoning the first tape because of unpredicted content I  continued with tape 2 and was pleasently surprised with an engaging  discussion on the philisophical nature of creativity and the human  condition.  One of my favorite readers, Jeff Riggenbach, read the last of  the four essays. I would still like the audio book redeveloped to have more  emphasis like the content contained in essay's 3 and 4. Arnold D Veness
June 30, 1999 What is creativity, is an audio lecture which needs either better focus or a better title.  In short it needs to be redevloped to be somewhat more creatively entertaining. When I purchased this audio book I  thought I was going to be getting an imaginative fun philosiphical look at  the human condition for being able to be creative.  What I received was a  series of four essays which sounded like they were read by a robot. Too  analytical and definitely NOT VERY CREATIVE or interesting. (Special note  I've only made it through the first one.) By looking at the copy right date  its easy to tell that this is one of Audio Scholars first audio novels so I  can't be too critical.  They're later ones are much much better especially,  T-Rex and the Crater of Doom, which takes a palentology scientific  discovery and turns into a really fun adventure of science and discovery. I  would really like to see this particular product redeveloped into a fun  imaginative philosiphical look at the human condition for being able to be  creative, similar to the T-Rex mention above. Leave the analytical  discussions of paintings out as they are too specific and I found them oh  so boring.  It's alright to create an audio lecture on the history of art,  but that's the history of art and not creativity and the human condition  per say. I would tell listeners to avoid this audio novel and wait for it  to be redeveloped properly. Arnold D Veness
To the publisher I would appreciate it if the publisher could produce an audio adaptation of this book. I would love to listen to this while I drive to work and to let my 16 month old son listen to it as a bedtime story.  My  goal is to expose him to some of my favorite passions, maths, sciences,  physics, geophysics, paleontology, astronomy, electronics, photonics, new  science and discoveries etc. The more audio books you can produce of the  above genre the more I will support you.

June 16, 1999 I would first like to thank Walter Alvarez, Jeff Riggenbach for taking the time to write this book and especially for creating an audio abridged version of it.  I would really like to see more of these types of  books adapted to audio format so that I may enjoy them. Orignally purchased  for my 16 month old son as a bedtime story, I have been trying to find all  the audio novels I can which share my passion for the maths, sciences,  physics, geophysics and astronomy. When I orginally this audio tape I  really didn't know what I was investing in but after letting my son listen  to it once, I decided to see what I was letting the little guy listen too.  What I discovered was a amazing story which took place over several decades  which involved everything I wanted to expose my young son too.  That is  scientists talking about the work they love to do in the process of solving  a mystery related to their field of research.  Scientists working hard,  solving difficult problems to explain a mystery. I could not have picked a  better audio novel to expose my son to the adventures of the, sciences,  physics, geophysics, palentology, astronomy, the dinosaurs and the rewards  which come from a good education and working hard. I would really like to  encourage more scientists to write about their discoveries and have them  abrigded to audio like this story.  This is the type of edutainment I love  to support! In short I highly recommend it!

Edwin Newman produces some of the finest edutainment audio series.  Bought initially as a bedtime story for my 16 month old son, I looked forward  to sharing my passion of physics, math and sciences with him.  The more I  listened the more I learned myself.  I really look forward to more audio  edutainment series from Edwin and look forward to learning about new  discoveries in physics, math and science and the current day scientists.  I  hope more scientists will take Edwins lead and share the passion of their  work in an audio format. In the future I would love to see audio versions  of HyperSpace, Beyond Einstein and Visions by Michio Kaku.
