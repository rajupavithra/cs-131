This series of books not only made my 4th grader who loves to read disappear into it's pages for days on end by also entranced my 5th grader who thinks comic books are real books. The most wonderful part of this series is it's complete lack of that boy/girl mushy stuff that quite frankly my kids don't need yet another dose of!

As a wiccan I was pleasantly surprised to find a well researched portrayal  of witchcraft without an extreme bias for or against.  The characters were  realistic in a way seldom found when dealing with any religious subject and  yet did not go in depth into the religious beliefs of the wiccan community  nor their conflict with mainstream beliefs.  An engrossing read!
