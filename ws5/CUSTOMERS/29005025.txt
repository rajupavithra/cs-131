This book is great for all teenager girls, it's a definate coming of age story that all girls should read.  I learned a lot from this book and highly recomend it to girls age 13 or over.
In every book I read, I always look for some kind of deep meaning in the context.  If a book is too shallow, then it does not quallify as a good book.  This book is a literal eye opener to the cruelties that go on.  There are too many neglected kids in this world who's parents sometimes don't see the pain behind the mask that their kids put on day after day.  I highly recomend this to parents of teenagers, because their kids are drifting farther and farther away and this book can help them realize that.  That's one of the reasons that Tangerine hit home for me.  Me and my half sister don't get a long at all and I know secrets about her that would blow my parents minds if they knew.  This book will help open parents minds to the cruelties going on between syblings, and so parents need to be aware of that.  I know that when I become a parent, then I will not be totally in the dark about these things.  Because of my own experiences, and this book.  This is the most meaningful book that I have ever read.  For the readers information, I'm not a shrink, I'm just a kid who WANTS their parents to ask a little more questions about why things are going on in their kids lives.  And trust me, just because we walk away from our parents, doesn't mean that we don't want to be chased.
