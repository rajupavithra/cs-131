While cultural pundits try to convince you that some literature is better than other literature, the truth is that all art is relative to individial tastes. Thus, it doesn't make any sense to think that a novel like this one is really any better than say, Michael Crichton or Stephen King. Aesthetic standards can't be grounded.<br />Thus, don't listen to anyone who tries to distinguish between &quot;serious&quot; works of literature like this one and allegedly &quot;lesser&quot; novels. The distinction is entirely illusory, because no novels are &quot;better&quot; than any others, and the concept of a &quot;great novel&quot; is an intellectual hoax.

This book isn't as good as Harry Potter in MY opinion, and no one can refute me. Tastes are relative!

You may say the color of the book's cover has nothing to do with it being good, but who are you to dictate what criteria I use to evaluate books. This book does NOT have a red cover, so in the trash it goes.

Vonnegut is no better or worse than Daniele Steele!
Stephen Wolfram is making a lot of noise about his \\"new kind of science,\\" and the revolutionary impact it will have. But Wolfram is wrong, because his theories are not as revolutionary as my own. If you really want to know about the \\"new kind of science\\" you will find it in my work, not his.<BR>Let me explain why I can so confidently make this statement. First, the issue of computers. While Stephen is right that computers will play an important role in the new kind of science, he failed to realize that his computer is not as good as mine. He has a pathetic, outdated model manufactured more than two months ago, while I buy a new computer each time a new breakthrough is made in micrprocessor speed and memory. Thus, my computer models are better than Wolfram's...
After buying and reading this book, I magically transformed from an old, fat white guy to a young, thin, black man. Well worth the money. Now off I go to increase racial awareness.
This book is enormously popular. It is also, I'm afraid, close to being completely worthless.<br />But how can a book be worthless if it's such an acclaimed best-seller you ask? That's like asking how Millie Vanilli could be talentless if they sold 7 million albums. Alas, mass popularity does not determine the value of any intellctual enedeavor, and often is a measure of its emptiness.<br />To see why this book isn't very rewarding, consider the following scenario. You find out that a book was written about a philosphy professor who spouts simple platitudes about the need for love, the beauty of the world, etc. Would you be interested in reading the book? Probably not, because the \\"ideas\\" espoused by the \\"philosopher\\" are banal and simplistic, however well-intended they may be. <br />But now, imagine that you find out that in addition to the \\"philosopher\\" dispensing simplistic arguments, he also dies and call his adherence to his ideals \\"life's greatest lesson.\\" Now, all of a sudden, you have a hugely popular best-seller on your hands. Now, suddenly, you have \\"Tuesdays with Morrie.\\"<br />Mind you, I'm not belittling Morrie. I'm sure he was a fine and kind man, and put forward his ideas with the very best of intentions. It's also sad that he died. But the mere event of his death alone cannot elevate his teachings to the level of philosophical profundity. His ideas can only be evaluated on their own merits, not in the light of his unfortunate death.<br />Some people, nonetheless, will maintain that this book has great originality in framing the death of Morrie, a philosophy teacher by profession, as his last and greatest lesson. Actually, that's been done before, about 2,350 years ago, to be reasonably precise. The Greek philosopher Socrates also maintained that his death, an execution by the Greek state, was the greatest expression of his philosophy. A certain fellow named Jesus who lived about 400 years later also seemed to think of his own death (at the hands of the Roman state this time) as the supreme example his teachings to mankind. In both of these cases, the lesson is all the more potent because the teachings themselves were so much more potent. The ideas of both Socrates and Jesus posed enormous provacative challenges to the entire culture and ideology of their time, so much so that many people were shocked by the implications of their ideas. <br />It's hard to imagine anyone being similarly shocked by the bland, trite teachings of Morrie. In the final analysis, it seems that much of the popularity of this book is based on a human emotional need to cry over the loss of a \\"loved one,\\" even one like Morrie whom we never actually knew. But those of you who want genuine spiritual or philosophical insights will be better served by spending your time reading Plato, the Bible, the Bhagvad Gita, the Tao or some of the other true classics of human thought.
It seems like such a waste of time. Any really good books will eventually be made into movies, or television specials, and you can save sooooooo much time by watching those instead. At least this book seems to agree that people who read books are stoopid or crazy, so that's pretty cool. You can just skim it and read about all the nuts who actually read books. Personally, I can't wait until this book is made into a movie, maybe starring J-Lo and Adam Sandler as two of the crazy egg-head book collectors.
Earlier this year, Joseph Ellis was suspended from his teaching position for one year without pay for blatantly lying to his students and the press about his accomplishments. While teaching a class on the Vietnam War era at Mt. Holyoke, Ellis claimed he was a hero in the war, when he actually saw no miltary involvement due to his academic appointment, and he falsely stated that he was a leader of the civil rights and anti-war movmements. You can read all about Ellis' lies by reviewing the story on the Washington Post website, or any number of other recent articles about the controversy.<br />It should go without saying that a history professor shouldn't be so flagrantly dishonest, but Ellis' lies are even graver because they're not confined to his personal life or even the recent past of this nation. Take &quot;Founding Brothers,&quot; the book listed here, and the recipient of a Pulitzer Prize earlier in the year. In this book, Ellis states that DNA evidence has proven once and for all that Thomas Jefferson fathered one or more children of Sally Heming, a black slave on his plantation. This is not true. Ellis severely distorted the conclusions about the DNA research published in the scientific journal. Rather than unmitakably identifying Jefferson as the father of Sally Hemings' children, the genetic evidence actually supported only the conclusion that one of twenty possible Jefferson males could have been the father. That is, there are 19 other Jefferson males besides Thomas who could have sired the Hemings children. But Ellis distorts the truth, giving readers the impression that this centuries-old controversy has been conclusively solved.<br />Those aren't the only points in this book where Ellis fails to give responsible historical explanations. His technique of describing the inner thoughts of founding fathers such as John Adams and Thomas Jefferson often goes far beyoond the primary documents and into the shadowy, dubious realm of psychoanalysis. In an odd way, Ellis' attempts to &quot;read&quot; hidden psychological motives out of his characters words and actions is a throwback to the middle part of last century, when a bevy of writers came up with psychological descriptions of Abraham Lincoln's hidden desire to be a dictator....to cite a more famous example. Ellis portays Jefferson, for instance, as a man with two natures, neither one of which knew what the other is doing. This contradicts a mountain of other historical analyses by more responsible scholars such as Merrill Peterson showing that Jefferson was, in fact, consciously motivated by a consistent set of principles, and even if he sometimes failed to live by them. And Adams, far from being the disjointed and rambling speaker and thinker that Ellis portays him to be, was actually Jefferson's equal in elegance and depth of thought. Ellis has reinvented these men for his own dramatic and largely fictional purposes, and has failed to honor the principles of responsible history.<br />So, caveat emptor: Despite his lucid prose, Ellis frequently distorts and outrightly contradicts the facts. Spend your money on books by authors who understand the meaning of the word &quot;truth.&quot;
This is a great story, especially if you've seen the Ken Burns documentary about Lewis and Clark and want more information. This is as good as Ambrose's other books, but this one is even creepier because Spanish people were trying to stop Lewis and Clark and there were Indians around and stuff. Pretty freaky. This was a very good book.
Writing about religion has always been a risky endeavor. There are few subjects which so often provoke banal,intellectually dishonest discussions that rarely get to the heart of the real issues. But Walter Kaufmann, one  of the greatest scholars of the last century, succeeds in Faith of a  Heretic where so many others have failed. Instead of defining concepts like  &quot;faith&quot; and &quot;religion&quot; without examining their  historical and cultural uses, Kaufmann traces religious ideas through their  development in the Hebrew Bible, New Testament and subsequent philosophical  discourse. This analysis results in a study of religion that avoids the  reductionist condemnations of faith so common among today's &quot;free  thinkers,&quot; and the simplistic diagnoses offered by writers in the  &quot;science and religion&quot; movement. If you want to start thinking  seriously about religion, this is the place to start.
