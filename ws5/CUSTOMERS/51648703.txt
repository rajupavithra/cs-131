I loved all of these stories. The tapes make great car entertainment. Hubbard has a fantastic sense of humor, witty &amp; intelligent and often edgy. Definitely way ahead of his time - meaining that you'd never expect a  traditional psi-fi writer Hubbard's age at the time to write something this  racy and &quot;with-it&quot;!  A winner!
I loved all of these stories.  I could not stop once I started them.  The pacing is great. The satire is great. Hubbard has a fantastic and witty sense of humor. These stories also really they get you thinking. Love them  all.

This book was so good I could hardly see straight! Not an avid reader but a lover of psi-fi, I began to read this book on the recommendation of my husband (an avid reader and psi-fi fan). WOW!  I could not put it  down!<br />At one point I was reading it IN THE CAR. Dangerous but it was just  too good! Great story, great characters!  A masterpiece!
