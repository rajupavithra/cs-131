We received 5 stars for this book in the UK. <br /> <br />This book introduces students to the history of every main media form at the start of each chapter and then looks at how to study Film, TV, Radio, Magazines, Newspapers, Comic & Cartoons and the Music Industry, using key media concepts (such as Audience and Language and Representation etc) and gives clear definitions of key terms and suggestions for activities etc.  <br /> <br />It was written in an accessible style for the UK market but some of the egs are inevitably relevant to the US. The book would be useful for teaching media study as part of an English program.
I am biased, as I'm the Series Editor, but every title in the series has lots of factual and conceptual background information for each topic, two sample six-week teaching schemes and teaching tips (and downloadable photocopiable worksheets and web notes from [...]) as well as 3-5 detailed case studies, full glossary and suggestions for further research.    Every writer is an experienced teacher and/or examiner and most titles (with the exception of ones with 'British' in the title) have a fairly international perspective.    More titles on the way...
