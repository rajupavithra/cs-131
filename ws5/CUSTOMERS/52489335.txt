Demos used an Inter-Disciplinary approach to writing this book. It resulted in a book that is dull and boring. Demos utilized Biography, History, Psychology, and Sociology in an attempt to better understand the witch crazes that periodically swept New England in the 17th century. Psychology is a load of garbage and Sociology is not much better. Demos should have kept his focus on his area of expertise: History. He focused on other outbreaks of witch hysteria other than Salem in 1692, and this proved to the book's only strong point. Salem is the best known outbreak of mass hysteria relating to witchcraft in Colonial America, but it was not the only one. Some outbreaks were simply accusations against 1 or 2 people at most. Other outbreaks may have seen several people accused, but not on the scale of Salem. I give this book a \\"1-star\\" rating simply because Amazon does not have one for \\"0-star\\" books.
Terry Goodkind is at the height of his powers. Chainfire is the BEST Sword of Truth book yet. I didn't think he could surpass Faith of the Fallen; yet, Goodkind has done just that. If the remaining SOT books are as good as this one, Goodkind will be remebered as GIANT in the genre of Fantasy Literature. Goodkind shows us what happens when Richard faces a new weapon Jagang has had created as well as the problems Richard encounters while searching for Kahlan and confronting a new spell form that some Sisters of the Dark have unleashed upon the world.
Edmund Morgan should have won the Pulitzer Prize in History when he wrote this book in 1975. He examines the irony that existed between slavery and freedom in Colonial America. The colonies demanded freedom from British tyranny; yet, they continued to deny freedom to their slaves. Morgan's book is well researched and is worth reading.
Rhys Isaac richly deserved his Pulitzer Prize for this excellent history of Colonial Virginia society. He shows how the coming of non-Anglican Protestant faiths (namely, Presbyterians and Baptists) to Virginia helped transform the society from one of deference to superiors to a society that began to see all white men as social equals (women, American Indians, and slaves would not receive this until much later). The book also provides excellent insight into the conditions that would lead some of the Founding Fathers to champion the doctrine of religious freedom.
The Wheel of Time series is \\"New Age\\" fantasy. Channeling, a new age technique, is the only form of magic in this series. The series GARBAGE! I've read much better fantasy than Robert Jordan. For example, Terry Goodkind's Sword of Truth series is 100 times BETTER than the Wheel of Time! I wasted my time reading the 1st 6 books, and I am glad I had the sense to stop there! Don't waste your money buying JUNK! Don't waste your time reading this JUNK!

This is the BEST Sword of Truth book that Goodkind has written so far. Goodkind shows just how diverse a war wizard's talents are. Even without being about to openly use his magic, Richard uses his gift in an unexpected manner. <BR>     His portrayal of the kind of society over which Emperor Jagang rules is a realistic portrayal of a Communist state. All work must be shared equally. Productivity is discouraged. Workers are encouraged to use sick time on a regular basis. I thought that Temple of the Winds was the best when I initially read the series (FOTF had not yet been published at that time). Now, I consider TOTW as the 2nd best book. Read the series. Goodkind has established himself as a master of the Fantasy genre!
If you have not played SenZar, then you do not know what you are missing. This is the BEST Fantasy Role-Playing Game! This is the game that beats the Wizards of the Coast (formerly known as TSR) Dungeons and Dragons / Advanced Dungeons and Dragons hands-down. No more are wizards limited by how many times they may cast a spell, or are priests limited to blunt-edged weapons only. Physical combat is simpler with characters having \\"Combat Value\\" (divded into \\"Attack Value\\" and \\"Defense Value\\") which determines what they need to roll on a d20 in order to achieve a hit. <BR>     Players can buy helpful skills for their characters (such as stealth, which enables them to surprise their opponents by moving without making noise and special powers (such as toughness which allows them to continue fighting even after receiving near-fatal wounds).<BR>     Players get to round out their characters' personalities with Karmic Attributes like \\"Overconfidence\\" or \\"Greed.\\" There is no alignment nonsense. Characters are either \\"good,\\" serving the \\"Cause\\" and the \\"Good Earth\\"; \\"evil,\\" serving the \\"Anti-Life\\" and the \\"Dark Earth Mother\\"; or \\"neutral\\" serving themselves only. No need to worry about other ridiculous concepts like \\"lawful, \\"neutral,\\" or \\"chaotic.\\" <BR>     Do yourself a favor, buy SenZar, and begin playing the BEST FRPG in existence. It is the FRPG of the 3rd millennium. You won't regret your investment (both in money and time) in this game.
Drawing upon numerous books, scholarly articles, newspapers, magazine articles, and the few publically released primary documents, Dr. Kurtz does an excellent job analyzing the assassination of John F. Kennedy. He has his own theory as to who killed President Kennedy, but he points out that there is NOT ENOUGH evidence to say EXACTLY who masterminded and carried out the assassination. He tells the readers that there was DEFINITELY a conspiracy to kill President Kennedy. This book is a good starting point for people who want to learn about the Kennedy assassination. Kurtz's endnotes and bibliography will point serious Kennedy assassination students to other sources on this subject.
