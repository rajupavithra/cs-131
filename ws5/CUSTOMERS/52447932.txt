You're going to LOVE BRITAIN!  I've spent a year in England and have made >30 visits all together. <br /> <br />Here are my reviews of the best guides....to meet you r exact needs.....I hope these are helpful and that you have a great visit!  I always gauge the quality of my visit by how much I remember a year later......this review is designed to help you get the guide that will be sure YOU remember your trip many years into the future.  Travel Safe and enjoy yourself to the max! <br /> <br />Fodor's <br />Fodor's is the best selling guide among Americans.  They have a bewildering array of different guides.  Here's which is what: <br />The Gold Guide is the main book with good reviews of everything and lots of tours, walks, and just about everything else you could think of.  It's not called the Gold guide for nothing though....it assumes you have money and are willing to spend it. <br />SeeIt! is a concise guide that extracts the most popular items from the Gold Guide <br />PocketGuide is designed for a quick first visit <br />UpCLOSE for independent travel that is cheap and well thought out <br />CityPack is a plastic pocket map with some guide information <br />Exploring is for cultural interests, lots of photos and designed to supplement the Gold guide <br /> <br />MapGuide <br />MapGuide is very easy to use and has the best location information for pubs, hotels, tourist attractions, museums, churches etc. that they manage to keep fairly up to date.  It's great for teaching you how to use the underground and the double decker buses.  The text sections are quick overviews, not reviews, but the strong suite here is brevity, not depth.  I strongly recommend this for your first few times learning your way around the classic tourist sites and experiences.  MapGuide is excellent as long as you are staying pretty much in the city centre.  When you get to be an old London hand, remember that the classic Londoners guide will always be an A to Z (zed) map and guide.  If you want to go a bit beyond the central core of the city (perhaps to Windsor, Hampton, or further away) you really need the proper AtoZ to be able to find exact routes and streets. <br /> <br />Time Out <br />The Time Out guides are very good.  Easy reading, short reviews of restaurants, hotels, and other sites, with good public transport maps that go beyond the city centre.  Many people who buy more than one guidebook end up liking this one best! <br /> <br />Blue Guides <br />Without doubt, the best of the walks guides.... the Blue Guide has been around since 1918 and has extremely well designed walks with lots of unique little side stops to hit on just about any interest you have.  If you want to pick up the feel of the city, this is the best book to do that for you.  This is one that you end up packing on your 10th trip, by which time it is well worn. <br /> <br />Michelin <br />Famous for their quality reviews, the Red Michelin Guides are for hotels & Restaurants, the Green Michelin Guides are for main tourist destinations.  However, the English language Green guide is the one most people use and it has now been supplemented with hotel and restaurant information.  These are the serious review guides as the famous Michelin ratings are issued via these books.  <br /> <br />Let's Go <br />Let's Go is a great guide series that specializes in the niche interest details that turn a trip into a great and memorable experience.  Started by and for college students, these guides are famous for the details provided by people who used the book the previous year.  They continue to focus on providing a great experience inexpensively.  If you want to know about the top restaurants, this is not for you (use Fodor's or Michelin).  Let's Go does have a bewildering array of different guides though.  Here's which is what: <br />Budget Guide is the main guide with incredibly detailed information and reviews on everything you can think of. <br />City Guide is just as intense but restricted to the single city. <br />PocketGuide is even smaller and features condensed information <br />MapGuide's are very good maps with public transportation and some other information (like museum hours, etc.) <br /> <br />Lonely Planet <br />Lonely Planet has City and Out To Eat Guides.  They are all about the experience so they focus on doing, being, getting there, and this means they have the best detailed information, including both inexpensive and really spectacular restaurants and hotels, out-of-the-way places, weird things to see and do, the list is endless. <br /> <br />Frommer's <br />These are time tested guides that pride themselves on being updated annually.  Although I think the guides below provide information that is in more depth or more concise (depending on what the guide is known for), if your main concern is that the guide has very little old or outdated information, then this would be a good guide for you. <br /> <br />Rick Steves' books are not recommended.  They may be an interesting read but their helpfulness is very poor.  They don't do well on updates, transportation details, or anything but the first-time-tourist routine and even that is somewhat superficial on anything but the mega-major sites. <br />

I've been to Italy several times.....Rome, Venice, Florence, Bologna, Milan, some of the hill towns, etc (most recently last April). Here are my reviews of the best guides to meet your exact needs.....I hope these are helpful and that you have a great visit! I always gauge the quality of my visit by how much I remember a year later......this review is designed to help you get the guide that will be sure YOU remember your trip many years into the future. Travel Safe and enjoy yourself to the max! <br /> <br />Rick Steves' books are not recommended. They may be an interesting read but their helpfulness is very poor. They don't do well on updates, transportation details, or anything but the first-time-tourist routine and even that is somewhat superficial on anything but the mega-major sites. <br /> <br />Frommer's <br />These are time tested guides that pride themselves on being updated annually. Although I think the guides below provide information that is in more depth or more concise (depending on what the guide is known for), if your main concern is that the guide has very little old or outdated information, then this would be a good guide for you. <br /> <br />Lonely Planet <br />Lonely Planet has City and Out To Eat Guides.

I've spent a year in England and have made >30 visits all together.[...]    Eyewitness Travel Guides  Eyewitness is appropriately named as each book provides spectacular 3d aerial angled views of the primary tourists sections.  The accompanying information has the full color photos everyone seems to want but what is great about these guides is that they do a fairly good job of providing details about sites, odd stories to perk your interest, and little known things to give you a decent background.  The history timelines are visually interesting and do a lot for American perspectives as it helps us a lot to see the full spread of the centuries in order to understand where the sites we are seeing fit into the multi-millenneal scope of things.  These are justifiably the best selling travel books for Americans.    [...]

Just to clarify the record.....Stark & Bradley is a bible of a reference work.....an ultimate resource for those serious about clinical MRI instrumentation and procedures. <br /> <br />Only Edelman's text attempted this feat but it is now out of date and as far as I know, not scheduled for a 2nd edition.
Be aware that there are essentially equal but very different approaches to treating various stages of prostate cancer.  You will find dramatically different points of view (all well supported with nearly equal pros and cons in the medical literature).  The major treatments are surgery, radiation therapy, and hormone therapy.  This author is a surgeon and this book is biased toward surgical intervention.  Please be aware that radiation therapy (either IMRT external beam or brachytherapeutic seed implants) is a popular choice and that serious advanced prostate cancer can often be shut down with hormone therapy.  To be fair to yourself, you need to consider ALL options and become well informed on all of them before you choose because you only get one opportunity to choose.  What is done is done and cannot be undone or revised.    I have prostate cancer myself, so this is a first person review of this book.  I won't tell you what my choice was because your choice needs to be what is right for you, not what someone else convinces you was right for them!

This is a classic, easy to read text on instructional objectives.  It clears up the confusion on types and applications of appropriate objectives, quickly gets you into format that will work for your particular situation, and then nicely walks you through the domains and their respective taxonomies.  The evaluation section is no slouch either....concisely explained and designed to make it easy to plug the objectives into the assessment process.
Nearly all knowledgeable Biblical scholars realize there have been a wide range of writings attributed to Jesus and his Apostles..... and that some of these were selected for compilation into the book that became known as the Bible.....and that some books have been removed from some versions of the Bible and others have been re-discovered in modern times. <br /> <br />The attention focused on Gnosticism by Dan Brown's DaVinci Code may be debatable, but the fact is that increased attention on academics tends to be predominately positive. <br /> <br />This is great......I seldom quote other reviewers, but there is one reviewer of Pagels' books who confided that he had been a Jesuit candidate and had been required to study a wide range of texts but was never was told about the Nag Hamadi texts.  He said: <br /> <br /> \\"Now I know why.  The Gospel of Thomas lays waste to the notion that Jesus was `the only begotten Son of God' and obviates the need for a formalized church when he says,  `When your leaders tell you that God is in heaven, say rather, God is within you, and without you.'  No wonder they suppressed this stuff!   The Roman Catholic Church hasn't maintained itself as the oldest institution in the world by allowing individuals to have a clear channel to see the divinity within all of us: they need to put God in a bottle, label the bottle, put that bottle on an altar, build a church around that altar, put a sign over the door, and create rubricks and rituals to keep out the dis-believing riff-raff.  Real `Us' versus `them' stuff, the polar opposite from `God is within You.'  `My God is bigger than your God' the church(s)seem to say. And you can only get there through \\"my\\" door/denomination.   But Jesus according to Thomas had it right: just keep it simple, and discover the indwelling Divinity `within you and without you.'\\" <br /> <br />Here are quickie reviews of what is being bought these days on the Gnostic Gospels and the lost books of the Bible in general:<br /> <br />The Lost Books of the Bible (0517277956) includes 26 apocryphal  books from the first 400 years that were not included in the New Testament. <br /> <br />Marvin Meyers' The Secret Teachings of Jesus : Four Gnostic Gospels (0394744330 )  is a new translation without commentary of The Secret Book of James, The Gospel of Thomas, The Book of Thomas, and The Secret Book of John. <br /> <br />James M. Robinson's The Nag Hammadi Library in English : Revised Edition (0060669357) has been around 25 years now and is in 2nd edition.  It has introductions to each of the 13 Nag Hammadi Codices and the Papyrus Berioinensis 8502. <br /> <br />The Complete Dead Sea Scrolls in English (0140278079)  by Geza Vermes has selected works....a complete work is more difficult to achieve than the publisher's marketing concept indicates.  His commentary generates strong reactions. <br /> <br />Elaine Pagels has 2 books  (The Gnostic Gospels 0679724532 and Beyond Belief : The Secret Gospel of Thomas 0375501568) that have received considerable attention lately.  For many, her work is controversial in that it is written for popular consumption and there is a strong modern interpretation.  She does attempt to reinterpret ancient gender relationships in the light of modern feminist thinking.  While this is a useful (and entertaining) aspect of college women's studies programs, it is not as unethical as some critics claim.  As hard as they may try, all historians interpret the past in the context of the present.

Nearly all knowledgeable Biblical scholars realize there have been a wide range of writings attributed to Jesus and his Apostles..... and that some of these were selected for compilation into the book that became known as the Bible.....and that some books have been removed from some versions of the Bible and others have been re-discovered in modern times. <br /> <br />The attention focused on Gnosticism by Dan Brown's DaVinci Code may be debatable, but the fact is that increased attention on academics tends to be predominately positive. <br /> <br />This is great......I seldom quote other reviewers, but there is one reviewer of Pagels' books who confided that he had been a Jesuit candidate and had been required to study a wide range of texts but was never was told about the Nag Hamadi texts.

The Gospel of Thomas lays waste to the notion that Jesus was `the only begotten Son of God' and obviates the need for a formalized church when he says,  `When your leaders tell you that God is in heaven, say rather, God is within you, and without you.'  No wonder they suppressed this stuff!   The Roman Catholic Church hasn't maintained itself as the oldest institution in the world by allowing individuals to have a clear channel to see the divinity within all of us: they need to put God in a bottle, label the bottle, put that bottle on an altar, build a church around that altar, put a sign over the door, and create rubricks and rituals to keep out the dis-believing riff-raff.

The confusion with all of the different opinions on this classic college introductory European medieval history text are clearly due to the differences in the backgrounds of the various readers. <br /> <br />Cantor has produced a book that is absolutely wonderful in it's ability to pull together the twisted history of both major and minor events throughout Europe and relate them to one another.  Being able to understand how Papal politics impacted the Germanic Princes and then caused reactions in England and the Low Countries, which then produced French political events that influenced the Papacy.....great stuff when it can all come together like this! <br />  <br />Cantor can read like an enjoyable novel if you have an active interest in the medieval period, he points out the seeds of feminism and does a good job of placing them in the context of the period, he does the same for heresy, piety and the monastic movements, law and politics, the development of monarchism, the growth of the bourgeoisie, and a host of other factors and elements from the middle ages. <br /> <br />There are valid criticisms of his work though....some of his facts are wrong (some he should have know and others have now had additional historical thought added to them)....for example, the Turks taking Constantinople and the details of the death of Thomas a Becket.  More serious to me though is the lack of footnotes (which are so essential to credibility that the readability issues must take second consideration) and the total lack of maps to help with orientations (especially important for those not intimately familiar with medieval European geography). <br /> <br />I've created lists that provide Amazon links to Cantor's top 10 medieval books and top 10 films, if you want to continue to follow the syllabus for medieval understanding that he lays out in the book. <br /> <br />

If you loved DaVinci Code or if you hated it, you must admit it did get a reaction from you....which in itself is one definition of a successful novel. Many readers have found themselves more interested in the information detailed in Dan Brown's books, and if so, this book is a good choice to begin to learn about the amazing history of the Christian Church.  <br /> <br />Especially Gnosticism and the early Christian Church, and especially the creation of the New Testament Bible.

His commentary generates strong reactions. <br /> <br />Elaine Pagels has 2 books  (The Gnostic Gospels 0679724532 and Beyond Belief : The Secret Gospel of Thomas 0375501568) that have received considerable attention lately.  For many, her work is controversial in that it is written for popular consumption and there is a strong modern interpretation.  She does attempt to reinterpret ancient gender relationships in the light of modern feminist thinking.  While this is a useful (and entertaining) aspect of college women's studies programs, it is not as unethical as some critics claim.  As hard as they may try, all historians interpret the past in the context of the present.  Obviously there is value in our attempts to re-interpret the past in the light of our own time. <br /> <br />If you want the full scholarly work it is W. Schneemelcher's 2 volume  New Testament Apocrypha. <br /> <br />Also, to understand the Cathars......try Barbara Tuckman's Distant Mirror for an incredible historical commentary on how the Christian Church has handled other points of view
If you loved DaVinci Code or if you hated it, you must admit it did get a reaction from you....which in itself is one definition of a successful novel. Many readers have found themselves more interested in the information detailed in Dan Brown's books, and if so, this book is a good choice to begin to learn about the amazing history of the Christian Church.  <br /> <br />Especially Gnosticism and the early Christian Church, and especially the creation of the New Testament Bible. For a different review....here is my review of books that build on these interests, especially the \\"lost\\" books of the New Testament Bible and the concepts of Gnosticism.  <br /> <br />Nearly all knowledgeable Biblical scholars realize there have been a wide range of writings attributed to Jesus and his Apostles..... and that some of these were selected for compilation into the book that became known as the Bible.....and that some books have been removed from some versions of the Bible and others have been re-discovered in modern times. <br /> <br />The attention focused on Gnosticism by Dan Brown's DaVinci Code may be debatable, but the fact is that increased attention on academics tends to be predominately positive, so I welcome those with first-time or renewed interest.  At least first-timers to Gnosticism are not pursuing the oh-so-popular legends of the Holy Grail, Bloodline of Christ, and Mary Magdalene. <br /> <br />This is great......I seldom quote other reviewers, but there is one reviewer of Pagels' books who confided that he had been a Jesuit candidate and had been required to study a wide range of texts but was never was told about the Nag Hamadi texts.  He said: <br /> <br /> \\"Now I know why.  The Gospel of Thomas lays waste to the notion that Jesus was `the only begotten Son of God' and obviates the need for a formalized church when he says,  `When your leaders tell you that God is in heaven, say rather, God is within you, and without you.'  No wonder they suppressed this stuff!   The Roman Catholic Church hasn't maintained itself as the oldest institution in the world by allowing individuals to have a clear channel to see the divinity within all of us: they need to put God in a bottle, label the bottle, put that bottle on an altar, build a church around that altar, put a sign over the door, and create rubricks and rituals to keep out the dis-believing riff-raff.  Real `Us' versus `them' stuff, the polar opposite from `God is within You.'  `My God is bigger than your God' the church(s)seem to say. And you can only get there through \\"my\\" door/denomination.   But Jesus according to Thomas had it right: just keep it simple, and discover the indwelling Divinity `within you and without you.'\\" <br /> <br />Here are quickie reviews of what is being bought these days on the Gnostic Gospels and the lost books of the Bible in general: <br /> <br />The Lost Books of the Bible (0517277956) includes 26 apocryphal  books from the first 400 years that were not included in the New Testament. <br /> <br />Marvin Meyers' The Secret Teachings of Jesus : Four Gnostic Gospels (0394744330 )  is a new translation without commentary of The Secret Book of James, The Gospel of Thomas, The Book of Thomas, and The Secret Book of John. <br /> <br />James M.

I've  made &#62;20 visits to France all together.  Here are my reviews of the best guides....to meet you r exact needs.....I hope these are helpful and that you have a great visit!  I always gauge the quality of my visit by how much I remember a year later......this review is designed to help you get the guide that will be sure YOU remember your trip many years into the future.  Travel Safe and enjoy yourself to the max! <br /> <br />Frommer's <br />These are time tested guides that pride themselves on being updated annually.  Although I think the guides below provide information that is in more depth or more concise (depending on what the guide is known for), if your main concern is that the guide has very little old or outdated information, then this would be a good guide for you. <br /> <br />Lonely Planet <br />Lonely Planet has City and Out To Eat Guides.  They are all about the experience so they focus on doing, being, getting there, and this means they have the best detailed information, including both inexpensive and really spectacular restaurants and hotels, out-of-the-way places, weird things to see and do, the list is endless. <br /> <br />Michelin <br />Famous for their quality reviews, the Red Michelin Guides are for hotels & Restaurants, the Green Michelin Guides are for main tourist destinations.  However, the English language Green guide is the one most people use and it has now been supplemented with hotel and restaurant information.  These are the serious review guides as the famous Michelin ratings are issued via these books. <br /> <br />Fodor's <br />Fodor's is the best selling guide among Americans.  They have a bewildering array of different guides.  Here's which is what: <br />The Gold Guide is the main book with good reviews of everything and lots of tours, walks, and just about everything else you could think of.  It's not called the Gold guide for nothing though....it assumes you have money and are willing to spend it. <br />SeeIt! is a concise guide that extracts the most popular items from the Gold Guide <br />PocketGuide is designed for a quick first visit <br />UpCLOSE for independent travel that is cheap and well thought out <br />CityPack is a plastic pocket map with some guide information <br />Exploring is for cultural interests, lots of photos and designed to supplement the Gold guide <br /> <br />MapGuide <br />MapGuide is very easy to use and has the best location information for hotels, tourist attractions, museums, churches etc. that they manage to keep fairly up to date.  It's great for teaching you how to use the Metro.  The text sections are quick overviews, not reviews, but the strong suite here is brevity, not depth.  I strongly recommend this for your first few times learning your way around the classic tourist sites and experiences.  MapGuide is excellent as long as you are staying pretty much in the center of the city. <br /> <br />Time Out <br />The Time Out guides are very good.  Easy reading, short reviews of restaurants, hotels, and other sites, with good public transport maps that go beyond the city centre.  Many people who buy more than one guidebook end up liking this one best! <br /> <br />Blue Guides <br />Without doubt, the best of the walks guides.... the Blue Guide has been around since 1918 and has extremely well designed walks with lots of unique little side stops to hit on just about any interest you have.  If you want to pick up the feel of the city, this is the best book to do that for you.  This is one that you end up packing on your 10th trip, by which time it is well worn. <br /> <br />Let's Go <br />Let's Go is a great guide series that specializes in the niche interest details that turn a trip into a great and memorable experience.  Started by and for college students, these guides are famous for the details provided by people who used the book the previous year.  They continue to focus on providing a great experience inexpensively.  If you want to know about the top restaurants, this is not for you (use Fodor's or Michelin).  Let's Go does have a bewildering array of different guides though.  Here's which is what: <br />Budget Guide is the main guide with incredibly detailed information and reviews on everything you can think of. <br />City Guide is just as intense but restricted to the single city. <br />PocketGuide is even smaller and features condensed information <br />MapGuide's are very good maps with public transportation and some other information (like museum hours, etc.) <br /> <br />Rick Steves' books are not recommended.  They may be an interesting read but their helpfulness is very poor.  They don't do well on updates, transportation details, or anything but the first-time-tourist routine and even that is somewhat superficial on anything but the mega-major sites.

This is one that you end up packing on your 10th trip, by which time it is well worn. <br /> <br />Let's Go <br />Let's Go is a great guide series that specializes in the niche interest details that turn a trip into a great and memorable experience.  Started by and for college students, these guides are famous for the details provided by people who used the book the previous year.  They continue to focus on providing a great experience inexpensively.  If you want to know about the top restaurants, this is not for you (use Fodor's or Michelin).  Let's Go does have a bewildering array of different guides though.  Here's which is what: <br />Budget Guide is the main guide with incredibly detailed information and reviews on everything you can think of. <br />City Guide is just as intense but restricted to the single city. <br />PocketGuide is even smaller and features condensed information <br />MapGuide's are very good maps with public transportation and some other information (like museum hours, etc.) <br /> <br />Rick Steves' books are not recommended.  They may be an interesting read but their helpfulness is very poor.  They don't do well on updates, transportation details, or anything but the first-time-tourist routine and even that is somewhat superficial on anything but the mega-major sites.
I've been to Belgiun and The Netherlands many times.  Here are my reviews of the best guides to meet you r exact needs.....I hope these are helpful and that you have a great visit!  I always gauge the quality of my visit by how much I remember a year later......this review is designed to help you get the guide that will be sure YOU remember your trip many years into the future.  Travel Safe and enjoy yourself to the max! <br /> <br />Rick Steves' books are not recommended.  They may be an interesting read but their helpfulness is very poor.  They don't do well on updates, transportation details, or anything but the first-time-tourist routine and even that is somewhat superficial on anything but the mega-major sites. <br /> <br />Frommer's <br />These are time tested guides that pride themselves on being updated annually.  Although I think the guides below provide information that is in more depth or more concise (depending on what the guide is known for), if your main concern is that the guide has very little old or outdated information, then this would be a good guide for you. <br /> <br />Lonely Planet <br />Lonely Planet has City and Out To Eat Guides.  They are all about the experience so they focus on doing, being, getting there, and this means they have the best detailed information, including both inexpensive and really spectacular restaurants and hotels, out-of-the-way places, weird things to see and do, the list is endless. <br /> <br />Blue Guides <br />Without doubt, the best of the walks guides.... the Blue Guide has been around since 1918 and has extremely well designed walks with lots of unique little side stops to hit on just about any interest you have.

It's great for teaching you how to use the public transportation system.  The text sections are quick overviews, not reviews, but the strong suite here is brevity, not depth.  I strongly recommend this for your first few times learning your way around the classic tourist sites and experiences.  MapGuide is excellent as long as you are staying pretty much in the center of the city. <br /> <br />Time Out <br />The Time Out guides are very good.  Easy reading, short reviews of restaurants, hotels, and other sites, with good public transport maps that go beyond the city centre.

These are the serious review guides as the famous Michelin ratings are issued via these books. <br /> <br />Fodor's <br />Fodor's is the best selling guide among Americans.

Here's which is what: <br />The Gold Guide is the main book with good reviews of everything and lots of tours, walks, and just about everything else you could think of.

They continue to focus on providing a great experience inexpensively.  If you want to know about the top restaurants, this is not foryou (use Fodor's or Michelin).  Let's Go does have a bewildering array of different guides though.  Here's which is what: <br />Budget Guide is the main guide with incredibly detailed information and reviews on everything you can think of. <br />City Guide is just as intense but restricted to the single city. <br />PocketGuide is even smaller and features condensed information <br />MapGuide's are very good maps with public transportation and some other information (like museum hours, etc.) <br /> <br />Michelin <br />Famous for their quality reviews, the Red Michelin Guides are for hotels & Restaurants, the Green Michelin Guides are for main tourist destinations.

I've been to Italy several times.....Rome, Venice, Florence, Bologna, Milan, some of the hill towns, etc.  Here are my reviews of the best guides to meet you r exact needs.....I hope these are helpful and that you have a great visit!  I always gauge the quality of my visit by how much I remember a year later......this review is designed to help you get the guide that will be sure YOU remember your trip many years into the future.  Travel Safe and enjoy yourself to the max! <br /> <br />Rick Steves' books are not recommended.  They may be an interesting read but their helpfulness is very poor.  They don't do well on updates, transportation details, or anything but the first-time-tourist routine and even that is somewhat superficial on anything but the mega-major sites. <br /> <br />Frommer's <br />These are time tested guides that pride themselves on being updated annually.  Although I think the guides below provide information that is in more depth or more concise (depending on what the guide is known for), if your main concern is that the guide has very little old or outdated information, then this would be a good guide for you. <br /> <br />Lonely Planet <br />Lonely Planet has City and Out To Eat Guides.  They are all about the experience so they focus on doing, being, getting there, and this means they have the best detailed information, including both inexpensive and really spectacular restaurants and hotels, out-of-the-way places, weird things to see and do, the list is endless. <br /> <br />Blue Guides <br />Without doubt, the best of the walks guides.... the Blue Guide has been around since 1918 and has extremely well designed walks with lots of unique little side stops to hit on just about any interest you have.  If you want to pick up the feel of the city, this is the best book to do that for you.  This is one that you end up packing on your 10th trip, by which time it is well worn. <br /> <br />MapGuide <br />MapGuide is very easy to use and has the bestlocation information for hotels, tourist attractions, museums, churches etc. that they manage to keep fairly up to date.  It's great for teaching you how to use the public transportation system.  The text sections are quick overviews, not reviews, but the strong suite here is brevity, not depth.  I strongly recommend this for your first few times learning your way around the classic tourist sites and experiences.  MapGuide is excellent as long as you are staying pretty much in the center of the city. <br /> <br />Time Out <br />The Time Out guides are very good.

Nearly all knowledgeable Biblical scholars realize there have been a wide range of writings attributed to Jesus and his Apostles..... and that some of these were selected for compilation into the book that became known as the Bible.....and that some books have been removed from some versions of the Bible and others have been re-discovered in modern times. <br /> <br />The attention focused on Gnosticism by Dan Brown's DaVinci Code may be debatable, but the fact is that increased attention on academics tends to be predominately positive, so I welcome those with first-time or renewed interest.  At least first-timers to Gnosticism are not pursuing the oh-so-popular legends of the Holy Grail, Bloodline of Christ, and Mary Magdalene. <br /> <br />This is great......I seldom quote other reviewers, but there is one reviewer of Pagels' books who confided that he had been a Jesuit candidate and had been required to study a wide range of texts but was never was told about the Nag Hamadi texts.  He said: <br /> <br /> \\"Now I know why.  The Gospel of Thomas lays waste to the notion that Jesus was `the only begotten Son of God' and obviates the need for a formalized church when he says,  `When your leaders tell you that God is in heaven, say rather, God is within you, and without you.'  No wonder they suppressed this stuff!   The Roman Catholic Church hasn't maintained itself as the oldest institution in the world by allowing individuals to have a clear channel to see the divinity within all of us: they need to put God in a bottle, label the bottle, put that bottle on an altar, build a church around that altar, put a sign over the door, and create rubricks and rituals to keep out the dis-believing riff-raff.  Real `Us' versus `them' stuff, the polar opposite from `God is within You.'  `My God is bigger than your God' the church(s)seem to say. And you can only get there through \\"my\\" door/denomination.   But Jesus according to Thomas had it right: just keep it simple, and discoverthe indwelling Divinity `within you and without you.'\\" <br /> <br />Here are quickie reviews of what is being bought these days on the Gnostic Gospels and the lost books of the Bible in general: <br /> <br />The Lost Books of the Bible (0517277956) includes 26 apocryphal  books from the first 400 years that were not included in the New Testament. <br /> <br />Marvin Meyers' The Secret Teachings of Jesus : Four Gnostic Gospels (0394744330 )  is a new translation without commentary of The Secret Book of James, The Gospel of Thomas, The Book of Thomas, and The Secret Book of John. <br /> <br />James M. Robinson's The Nag Hammadi Library in English : Revised Edition (0060669357) has been around 25 years now and is in 2nd edition.  It has introductions to each of the 13 Nag Hammadi Codices and the Papyrus Berioinensis 8502. <br /> <br />The Complete Dead Sea Scrolls in English (0140278079)  by Geza Vermes has selected works....a complete work is more difficult to achieve than the publisher's marketing concept indicates.  His commentary generates strong reactions. <br /> <br />Elaine Pagels has 2 books  (The Gnostic Gospels 0679724532 and Beyond Belief : The Secret Gospel of Thomas 0375501568) that have received considerable attention lately.  For many, her work is controversial in that it is written for popular consumption and there is a strong modern interpretation.  She does attempt to reinterpret ancient gender relationships in the light of modern feminist thinking.  While this is a useful (and entertaining) aspect of college women's studies programs, it is not as unethical as some critics claim.  As hard as they may try, all historians interpret the past in the context of the present.  Obviously there is value in our attempts to re-interpret the past in the light of our own time. <br /> <br />If you want the full scholarly work it is W. Schneemelcher's 2 volume  New Testament Apocrypha. <br /> <br />Also, to understand the Cathars......try Barbara Tuckman's DistantMirror for an incredible historical commentary on how the Christian Church has handled other points of view <br />

Here's which is what: <br />The Gold Guide is the main book with good reviews of everything and lots of tours, walks, and just about everything else you could think of.  It's not called the Gold guide for nothing though....it assumes you have money and are willing to spend it. <br />SeeIt! is a concise guide that extracts the most popular items from the Gold Guide <br />PocketGuide is designed for a quick first visit <br />UpCLOSE for independent travel that is cheap and well thought out <br />CityPack is a plastic pocket map with some guide information <br />Exploring is for cultural interests, lots of photos and designed to supplement the Gold guide <br /> <br />MapGuide <br />MapGuide is very easy to use and has the best location information for pubs, hotels, tourist attractions, museums, churches etc. that they manage to keep fairly up to date.  It's great for teaching you how to use the underground and the double decker buses.  The text sections are quick overviews, not reviews, but the strong suite here is brevity, not depth.  I strongly recommend this for your first few times learningyour way around the classic tourist sites and experiences.  MapGuide is excellent as long as you are staying pretty much in the city centre.  When you get to be an old London hand, remember that the classic Londoners guide will always be an A to Z (zed) map and guide.  If you want to go a bit beyond the central core of the city (perhaps to Windsor, Hampton, or further away) you really need the proper AtoZ to be able to find exact routes and streets. <br /> <br />Time Out <br />The Time Out guides are very good.  Easy reading, short reviews of restaurants, hotels, and other sites, with good public transport maps that go beyond the city centre.  Many people who buy more than one guidebook end up liking this one best! <br /> <br />Blue Guides <br />Without doubt, the best of the walks guides.... the Blue Guide has been around since 1918 and has extremely well designed walks with lots of unique little side stops to hit on just about any interest you have.  If you want to pick up the feel of the city, this is the best book to do that for you.  This is one that you end up packing on your 10th trip, by which time it is well worn. <br /> <br />Michelin <br />Famous for their quality reviews, the Red Michelin Guides are for hotels & Restaurants, the Green Michelin Guides are for main tourist destinations.

They continue to focus on providing a great experience inexpensively.  If you want to know about the top restaurants, this is not for you (use Fodor's or Michelin).

They are all about the experience so they focus on doing, being, getting there, and this means they have the best detailed information, including both inexpensive and really spectacular restaurants and hotels, out-of-the-way places, weird things to see and do, the list is endless. <br /> <br />Frommer's <br />These are time tested guides that pride themselves on being updated annually.  Although I think the guides below provide information that is in more depth or more concise (depending on what the guide is known for), if your main concern is that the guide has very little old or outdated information, then this would be a good guide for you. <br /> <br /> <br />

This is the definitive reference on the Aprocrypha.  There is a 2 volume set. <br /> <br />...here is my review of books that build on these those who are looking for better information on the \\"lost\\" books of the New Testament Bible and the concepts of Gnosticism. <br /> <br />Nearly all knowledgeable Biblical scholars realize there have been a wide range of writings attributed to Jesus and his Apostles..... and that some of these were selected for compilation into the book that became known as the Bible.....and that some books have been removed from some versions of the Bible and others have been re-discovered in modern times. <br /> <br />The attention focused on Gnosticism by Dan Brown's DaVinci Code may be debatable, but the fact is that increased attention on academics tends to be predominately positive, so I welcome those with first-time or renewed interest.  At least first-timers to Gnosticism are not pursuing the oh-so-popular legends of the Holy Grail, Bloodline of Christ, and Mary Magdalene. <br /> <br />This is great......I seldom quote other reviewers, but there is one reviewer of Pagels' books who confided that he had been a Jesuit candidate and had been required to study a wide range of texts but was never was told about the Nag Hamadi texts.  He said: <br /> <br /> \\"Now I know why.  The Gospel of Thomas lays waste to the notion that Jesus was `the only begotten Son of God' and obviates the need for a formalized church when he says,  `When your leaders tell you that God is in heaven, say rather, God is within you, and without you.'  No wonder they suppressed this stuff!   The Roman Catholic Church hasn't maintained itself as the oldest institution in the world by allowing individuals to have a clear channel to see the divinity within all of us: they need to put God in a bottle, label the bottle, put that bottle on an altar, build a church around that altar, put a sign over the door, and create rubricks and rituals to keep out the dis-believing riff-raff.  Real `Us' versus `them' stuff, the polar opposite from `God is within You.'  `My God is bigger than your God' the church(s)seem to say. And you can only get there through \\"my\\" door/denomination.   But Jesus according to Thomas had it right: just keep it simple, and discover the indwelling Divinity `within you and without you.'\\" <br /> <br />Here are quickie reviews of what is being bought these days on the Gnostic Gospels and the lost books of the Bible in general: <br /> <br />The Lost Books of the Bible (0517277956) includes 26 apocryphal  books from the first 400 years that were not included in the New Testament. <br /> <br />Marvin Meyers' The Secret Teachings of Jesus : Four Gnostic Gospels (0394744330 )  is a new translation without commentary of The Secret Book of James, The Gospel of Thomas, The Book of Thomas, and The Secret Book of John. <br /> <br />James M. Robinson's The Nag Hammadi Library in English : Revised Edition (0060669357) has been around 25 years now and is in 2nd edition.  It has introductions to each of the 13 Nag Hammadi Codices and the Papyrus Berioinensis 8502. <br /> <br />The Complete Dead Sea Scrolls in English (0140278079)  by Geza Vermes has selected works....a complete work is more difficult to achieve than the publisher's marketing concept indicates.  His commentary generates strong reactions. <br /> <br />Elaine Pagels has 2 books  (The Gnostic Gospels 0679724532 and Beyond Belief : The Secret Gospel of Thomas 0375501568) that have received considerable attention lately.  For many, her work is controversial in that it is written for popular consumption and there is a strong modern interpretation.  She does attempt to reinterpret ancient gender relationships in the light of modern feminist thinking.  While this is a useful (and entertaining) aspect of college women's studies programs, it is not as unethical as some critics claim.  As hard as they may try, all historians interpret the past in the context of the present.  Obviously there is value in our attempts to re-interpret the past in the light of our own time. <br /> <br />Also, to understand the Cathars......try Barbara Tuckman's Distant Mirror for an incredible historical commentary on how the Christian Church has handled other points of view

This book is a good choice to begin to learn about the amazing history of the Christian Church.  <br /> <br />Especially Gnosticism and the early Christian Church, and especially the creation of the New Testament Bible. For a different review....here is my review of books that build on these interests, especially the \\"lost\\" books of the New Testament Bible and the concepts of Gnosticism. <br /> <br />Nearly all knowledgeable Biblical scholars realize there have been a wide range of writings attributed to Jesus and his Apostles..... and that some of these were selected for compilation into the book that became known as the Bible.....and that some books have been removed from some versions of the Bible and others have been re-discovered in modern times. <br /> <br />The attention focused on Gnosticism by Dan Brown's DaVinci Code may be debatable, but the fact is that increased attention on academics tends to be predominately positive, so I welcome those with first-time or renewed interest.  At least first-timers to Gnosticism are not pursuing the oh-so-popular legends of the Holy Grail, Bloodline of Christ, and Mary Magdalene. <br /> <br />This is great......I seldom quote other reviewers, but there is one reviewer of Pagels' books who confided that he had been a Jesuit candidate and had been required to study a wide range of texts but was never was told about the Nag Hamadi texts.  He said: <br /> <br /> \\"Now I know why.  The Gospel of Thomas lays waste to the notion that Jesus was `the only begotten Son of God' and obviates the need for a formalized church when he says,  `When your leaders tell you that God is in heaven, say rather, God is within you, and without you.'  No wonder they suppressed this stuff!   The Roman Catholic Church hasn't maintained itself as the oldest institution in the world by allowing individuals to have a clear channel to see the divinity within all of us: they need to put God in a bottle, label the bottle, put that bottle on an altar, build a church around that altar, put a sign over the door, and create rubricks and rituals to keep out the dis-believing riff-raff.  Real `Us' versus `them' stuff, the polar opposite from `God is within You.'  `My God is bigger than your God' the church(s)seem to say. And you can only get there through \\"my\\" door/denomination.   But Jesus according to Thomas had it right: just keep it simple, and discover the indwelling Divinity `within you and without you.'\\" <br /> <br />Here are quickie reviews of what is being bought these days on the Gnostic Gospels and the lost books of the Bible in general: <br /> <br />The Lost Books of the Bible (0517277956) includes 26 apocryphal  books from the first 400 years that were not included in the New Testament. <br /> <br />Marvin Meyers' The Secret Teachings of Jesus : Four Gnostic Gospels (0394744330 )  is a new translation without commentary of The Secret Book of James, The Gospel of Thomas, The Book of Thomas, and The Secret Book of John. <br /> <br />James M. Robinson's The Nag Hammadi Library in English : Revised Edition (0060669357) has been around 25 years now and is in 2nd edition.  It has introductions to each of the 13 Nag Hammadi Codices and the Papyrus Berioinensis 8502. <br /> <br />The Complete Dead Sea Scrolls in English (0140278079)  by Geza Vermes has selected works....a complete work is more difficult to achieve than the publisher's marketing concept indicates.  His commentary generates strong reactions. <br /> <br />Elaine Pagels has 2 books  (The Gnostic Gospels 0679724532 and Beyond Belief : The Secret Gospel of Thomas 0375501568) that have received considerable attention lately.  For many, her work is controversial in that it is written for popular consumption and there is a strong modern interpretation.  She does attempt to reinterpret ancient gender relationships in the light of modern feminist thinking.  While this is a useful (and entertaining) aspect of college women's studies programs, it is not as unethical as some critics claim.  As hard as they may try, all historians interpret the past in the context of the present.  Obviously there is value in our attempts to re-interpret the past in the light of our own time. <br /> <br />If you want the full scholarly work it is W. Schneemelcher's 2 volume  New Testament Apocrypha. <br /> <br />Also, to understand the Cathars......try Barbara Tuckman's Distant Mirror for an incredible historical commentary on how the Christian Church has handled other points of view

Here's which is what: <br />The Gold Guide is the main book with good reviews of everything and lots of tours, walks, and just about everything else you could think of.  It's not called the Gold guide for nothing though....it assumes you have money and are willing to spend it. <br />SeeIt! is a concise guide that extracts the most popular items from the Gold Guide <br />PocketGuide is designed for a quick first visit <br />UpCLOSE for independent travel that is cheap and well thought out <br />CityPack is a plastic pocket map with some guide information <br />Exploring is for cultural interests, lots of photos and designed to supplement the Gold guide <br /> <br />MapGuide <br />MapGuide is very easy to use and has the best location information for pubs, hotels, tourist attractions, museums, churches etc. that they manage to keep fairly up to date.  It's great for teaching you how to use the underground and the double decker buses.  The text sections are quick overviews, not reviews, but the strong suite here is brevity, not depth.  I strongly recommend this for your first few times learning your way around the classic tourist sites and experiences.  MapGuide is excellent as long as you are staying pretty much in the city centre.  When you get to be an old London hand, remember that the classic Londoners guide will always be an A to Z (zed) map and guide.  If you want to go a bit beyondthe central core of the city (perhaps to Windsor, Hampton, or further away) you really need the proper AtoZ to be able to find exact routes and streets. <br /> <br />Time Out <br />The Time Out guides are very good.  Easy reading, short reviews of restaurants, hotels, and other sites, with good public transport maps that go beyond the city centre.  Many people who buy more than one guidebook end up liking this one best! <br /> <br />Blue Guides <br />Without doubt, the best of the walks guides.... the Blue Guide has been around since 1918 and has extremely well designed walks with lots of unique little side stops to hit on just about any interest you have.  If you want to pick up the feel of the city, this is the best book to do that for you.  This is one that you end up packing on your 10th trip, by which time it is well worn. <br /> <br />Michelin <br />Famous for their quality reviews, the Red Michelin Guides are for hotels & Restaurants, the Green Michelin Guides are for main tourist destinations.  However, the English language Green guide is the one most people use and it has now been supplemented with hotel and restaurant information.  These are the serious review guides as the famous Michelin ratings are issued via these books.  <br /> <br />Let's Go <br />Let's Go is a great guide series that specializes in the niche interest details that turn a trip into a great and memorable experience.  Started by and for college students, these guides are famous for the details provided by people who used the book the previous year.  They continue to focus on providing a great experience inexpensively.  If you want to know about the top restaurants, this is not for you (use Fodor's or Michelin).  Let's Go does have a bewildering array of different guides though.  Here's which is what: <br />Budget Guide is the main guide with incredibly detailed information and reviews on everything you can think of. <br />City Guide is just as intense but restricted to the single city.<br />PocketGuide is even smaller and features condensed information <br />MapGuide's are very good maps with public transportation and some other information (like museum hours, etc.) <br /> <br />Lonely Planet <br />Lonely Planet has City and Out To Eat Guides.  They are all about the experience so they focus on doing, being, getting there, and this means they have the best detailed information, including both inexpensive and really spectacular restaurants and hotels, out-of-the-way places, weird things to see and do, the list is endless. <br /> <br />

They may be an interesting read but their helpfulness is very poor.  They don't do well on updates, transportation details, or anything but the first-time-tourist routine and even that is somewhat superficial on anything but the mega-major sites. <br /> <br />Frommer's <br />These are time tested guides that pride themselves on being updated annually.  Although I think the guides below provide information that is in more depth or more concise (depending on what the guide is known for), if your main concern is that the guide has very little old or outdated information, then this would be a good guide for you. <br /> <br />Lonely Planet <br />Lonely Planet has City and Out To Eat Guides.

However, the English language Green guide is the one most people use and it has now been supplemented with hotel and restaurant information.

Although I think the guides below provide information that is in more depth or more concise (depending on what the guide is known for), if your main concern is that the guide has very little old or outdated information, then this would be a good guide for you. <br /> <br />

This book is a good choice to begin to learn about the amazing historical writings that were not included in the traditional holy books. <br /> <br />Especially Gnosticism and the early Christian Church, and especially the creation of the New Testament Bible. For a different review....here is my review of books that build on these interests, especially the \\"lost\\" books of the New Testament Bible and the concepts of Gnosticism. <br /> <br />Nearly all knowledgeable Biblical scholars realize there have been a wide range of writings attributed to Jesus and his Apostles..... and that some of these were selected for compilation into the book that became known as the Bible.....and that some books have been removed from some versions of the Bible and others have been re-discovered in modern times. <br /> <br />The attention focused on Gnosticism by Dan Brown's DaVinci Code may be debatable, but the fact is that increased attention on academics tends to be predominately positive, so I welcome those with first-time or renewed interest.  At least first-timers to Gnosticism are not pursuing the oh-so-popular legends of the Holy Grail, Bloodline of Christ, and Mary Magdalene. <br /> <br />This is great......I seldom quote other reviewers, but there is one reviewer of Pagels' books who confided that he had been a Jesuit candidate and had been required to study a wide range of texts but was never was told about the Nag Hamadi texts.  He said: <br /> <br /> \\"Now I know why.  The Gospel of Thomas lays waste to the notion that Jesus was `the only begotten Son of God' and obviates the need for a formalized church when he says,  `When your leaders tell you that God is in heaven, say rather, God is within you, and without you.'  No wonder they suppressed this stuff!   The Roman Catholic Church hasn't maintained itself as the oldest institution in the world by allowing individuals to have a clear channel to see the divinity within all of us: they need to put God in a bottle, label the bottle, put that bottle on an altar, build a church around that altar, put a sign over the door, and create rubricks and rituals to keep out the dis-believing riff-raff.  Real `Us' versus `them' stuff, the polar opposite from `God is within You.'  `My God is bigger than your God' the church(s)seem to say. And you can only get there through \\"my\\" door/denomination.   But Jesus according to Thomas had it right: just keep it simple, and discover the indwelling Divinity `within you and without you.'\\" <br /> <br />Here are quickie reviews of what is being bought these days on the Gnostic Gospels and the lost books of the Bible in general: <br /> <br />The Lost Books of the Bible (0517277956) includes 26 apocryphal  books from the first 400 years that were not included in the New Testament. <br /> <br />Marvin Meyers' The Secret Teachings of Jesus : Four Gnostic Gospels (0394744330 )  is a new translation without commentary of The Secret Book of James, The Gospel of Thomas, The Book of Thomas, and The Secret Book of John. <br /> <br />James M. Robinson's The Nag Hammadi Library in English : Revised Edition (0060669357) has been around 25 years now and is in 2nd edition.  It has introductions to each of the 13 Nag Hammadi Codices and the Papyrus Berioinensis 8502. <br /> <br />The Complete Dead Sea Scrolls in English (0140278079)  by Geza Vermes has selected works....a complete work is more difficult to achieve than the publisher's marketing concept indicates.  His commentary generates strong reactions. <br /> <br />Elaine Pagels has 2 books  (The Gnostic Gospels 0679724532 and Beyond Belief : The Secret Gospel of Thomas 0375501568) that have received considerable attention lately.  For many, her work is controversial in that it is written for popular consumption and there is a strong modern interpretation.  She does attempt to reinterpret ancient gender relationships in the light of modern feminist thinking.  While this is a useful (and entertaining) aspect of college women's studies programs, it is not as unethical as some critics claim.  As hard as they may try, all historians interpret the past in the context of the present.  Obviously there is value in our attempts to re-interpret the past in the light of our own time. <br /> <br />If you want the full scholarly work it is W. Schneemelcher's 2 volume  New Testament Apocrypha. <br /> <br />Also, to understand the Cathars......try Barbara Tuckman's Distant Mirror for an incredible historical commentary on how the Christian Church has handled other points of view
This book is a good choice to begin to learn about the amazing history of the Christian Church.  <br /> <br />Especially Gnosticism and the early Christian Church, and especially the creation of the New Testament Bible. For a different review....here is my review of books that build on these interests, especially the \\"lost\\" books of the New Testament Bible and the concepts of Gnosticism. <br /> <br />Nearly all knowledgeable Biblical scholars realize there have been a wide range of writings attributed to Jesus and his Apostles..... and that some of these were selected for compilation into the book that became known as the Bible.....and that some books have been removed from some versions of the Bible and others have been re-discovered in modern times. <br /> <br />The attention focused on Gnosticism by Dan Brown's DaVinci Code may be debatable, but the fact is that increased attention on academics tends to be predominately positive, so I welcome those with first-time or renewed interest.

But Jesus according to Thomas had it right: just keep it simple, and discover the indwelling Divinity `within you and without you.'\\" <br /> <br />Here are quickie reviews of what is being bought these days on the Gnostic Gospels and the lost books of the Bible in general: <br /> <br />The Lost Books of the Bible (0517277956) includes 26 apocryphal  books from the first 400 years that were not included in the New Testament. <br /> <br />Marvin Meyers' The Secret Teachings of Jesus : Four Gnostic Gospels (0394744330 )  is a new translation without commentary of The Secret Book of James, The Gospel of Thomas, The Book of Thomas, and The Secret Book of John. <br /> <br />James M. Robinson's The Nag Hammadi Library in English : Revised Edition (0060669357) has been around 25 years now and is in 2nd edition.  It has introductions to each of the 13 Nag Hammadi Codices and the Papyrus Berioinensis 8502. <br /> <br />The Complete Dead Sea Scrolls in English (0140278079)  by Geza Vermes has selected works....a complete work is more difficult to achieve than the publisher's marketing concept indicates.  His commentary generates strong reactions. <br /> <br />Elaine Pagels has 2 books  (The Gnostic Gospels 0679724532 and Beyond Belief : The Secret Gospel of Thomas 0375501568) that have received considerable attention lately.  For many, her work is controversial in that it is written for popular consumption and there is a strong modern interpretation.  She does attempt to reinterpret ancient gender relationships in the light of modern feminist thinking.  While this is a useful (and entertaining) aspect of college women's studies programs, it is not as unethical as some critics claim.  As hard as they may try, all historians interpret the past in the context of the present.  Obviously there is value in our attempts to re-interpret the past in the light of our own time. <br /> <br />If you want the full scholarly work it is W. Schneemelcher's 2 volume  New Testament Apocrypha. <br /> <br />Also, to understand the Cathars......try Barbara Tuckman's Distant Mirror for an incredible historical commentary on how the Christian Church has handled other points of view
I've spent a year in England and have made &#62;30 visits all together. <br /> <br />Here are my reviews of the best guides....to meet you r exact needs.....I hope these are helpful and that you have a great visit!  I always gauge the quality of my visit by how much I remember a year later......this review is designed to help you get the guide that will be sure YOU remember your trip many years into the future.  Travel Safe and enjoy yourself to the max! <br /> <br />Lonely Planet <br />Lonely Planet has City and Out To Eat Guides.  They are all about the experience so they focus on doing, being, getting there, and this means they have the best detailed information, including both inexpensive and really spectacular restaurants and hotels, out-of-the-way places, weird things to see and do, the list is endless. <br /> <br />MapGuide <br />MapGuide is very easy to use and has the best location information for pubs, hotels, tourist attractions, museums, churches etc. that they manage to keep fairly up to date.  It's great for teaching you how to use the underground and the double decker buses.  The text sections are quick overviews, not reviews, but the strong suite here is brevity, not depth.  I strongly recommend this for your first few times learning your way around the classic tourist sites and experiences.  MapGuide is excellent as long as you are staying pretty much in the city centre.  When you get to be an old London hand, remember that the classic Londoners guide will always be an A to Z (zed) map and guide.  If you want to go a bit beyond the central core of the city (perhaps to Windsor, Hampton, or further away) you really need the proper AtoZ to be able to find exact routes and streets. <br /> <br />Time Out <br />The Time Out guides are very good.  Easy reading, short reviews of restaurants, hotels, and other sites, with good public transport maps that go beyond the city centre.  Many people who buy more than one guidebook end up liking this one best! <br /> <br />Blue Guides <br />Without doubt, the best of the walks guides.... the Blue Guide has been around since 1918 and has extremely well designed walks with lots of unique little side stops to hit on just about any interest you have.  If you want to pick up the feel of the city, this is the best book to do that for you.  This is one that you end up packing on your 10th trip, by which time it is well worn. <br /> <br />Michelin <br />Famous for their quality reviews, the Red Michelin Guides are for hotels & Restaurants, the Green Michelin Guides are for main tourist destinations.  However, the English language Green guide is the one most people use and it has now been supplemented with hotel and restaurant information.  These are the serious review guides as the famous Michelin ratings are issued via these books.  <br /> <br />Let's Go <br />Let's Go is a great guide series that specializes in the niche interest details that turn a trip into a great and memorable experience.  Started by and for college students, these guides are famous for the details provided by people who used the book the previous year.  They continue to focus on providing a great experience inexpensively.  If you want to know about the top restaurants, this is not for you (use Fodor's or Michelin).  Let's Go does have a bewildering array of different guides though.  Here's which is what: <br />Budget Guide is the main guide with incredibly detailed information and reviews on everything you can think of. <br />City Guide is just as intense but restricted to the single city. <br />PocketGuide is even smaller and features condensed information <br />MapGuide's are very good maps with public transportation and some other information (like museum hours, etc.) <br /> <br />Fodor's <br />Fodor's is the best selling guide among Americans.  They have a bewildering array of different guides.  Here's which is what: <br />The Gold Guide is the main book with good reviews of everything and lots of tours, walks, and just about everything else you could think of.  It's not called the Gold guide for nothing though....it assumes you have money and are willing to spend it. <br />PocketGuide is designed for a quick first visit <br />UpCLOSE for independent travel that is cheap and well thought out <br />CityPack is a plastic pocket map with some guide information <br />Exploring is for cultural interests, lots of photos and designed to supplement the Gold guide <br /> <br /> <br />

If you loved DaVinci Code or if you hated it, you must admit it did get a reaction from you....which in itself is one definition of a successful novel. Many readers have found themselves more interested in the information detailed in Dan Brown's books, and if so, this book is a good choice to begin to learn about the amazing history of the Christian Church.  <br /> <br />Especially Gnosticism and the early Christian Church, and especially the creation of the New Testament Bible. For a different review....here is my review of books that build on these interests, especially the \\"lost\\" books of the New Testament Bible and the concepts of Gnosticism. <br /> <br />Nearly all knowledgeable Biblical scholars realize there have been a wide range of writings attributed to Jesus and his Apostles..... and that some of these were selected for compilation into the book that became known as the Bible.....and that some books have been removed from some versions of the Bible and others have been re-discovered in modern times. <br /> <br />The attention focused on Gnosticism by Dan Brown's DaVinci Code may be debatable, but the fact is that increased attention on academics tends to be predominately positive, so I welcome those with first-time or renewed interest.  At least first-timers to Gnosticism are not pursuing the oh-so-popular legends of the Holy Grail, Bloodline of Christ, and Mary Magdalene. <br /> <br />This is great......I seldom quote other reviewers, but there is one reviewer of Pagels' books who confided that he had been a Jesuit candidate and had been required to study a wide range of texts but was never was told about the Nag Hamadi texts.  He said: <br /> <br /> \\"Now I know why.  The Gospel of Thomas lays waste to the notion that Jesus was `the only begotten Son of God' and obviates the need for a formalized church when he says,  `When your leaders tell you that God is in heaven, say rather, God is within you, and without you.'  No wonder they suppressed this stuff!The Roman Catholic Church hasn't maintained itself as the oldest institution in the world by allowing individuals to have a clear channel to see the divinity within all of us: they need to put God in a bottle, label the bottle, put that bottle on an altar, build a church around that altar, put a sign over the door, and create rubricks and rituals to keep out the dis-believing riff-raff.  Real `Us' versus `them' stuff, the polar opposite from `God is within You.'  `My God is bigger than your God' the church(s)seem to say.

The Complete Dead Sea Scrolls in English (0140278079)  by Geza Vermes has selected works....a complete work is more difficult to achieve than the publisher's marketing concept indicates.  His commentary generates strong reactions.    Elaine Pagels has 2 books  (The Gnostic Gospels 0679724532 and Beyond Belief : The Secret Gospel of Thomas 0375501568) that have received considerable attention lately.  For many, her work is controversial in that it is written for popular consumption and there is a strong modern interpretation.  She does attempt to reinterpret ancient gender relationships in the light of modern feminist thinking.  While this is a useful (and entertaining) aspect of college women's studies programs, it is not as unethical as some critics claim.  As hard as they may try, all historians interpret the past in the context of the present.  Obviously there is value in our attempts to re-interpret the past in the light of our own time.    If you want the full scholarly work it is W. Schneemelcher's 2 volume  New Testament Apocrypha.    Also, to understand the Cathars......try Barbara Tuckman's Distant Mirror for an incredible historical commentary on how the Christian Church has handled other points of view
If you loved DaVinci Code or if you hated it, you must admit it did get a reaction from you....which in itself is one definition of a successful novel. Many readers have found themselves more interested in the information detailed in Dan Brown's books, and if so, this book is a good choice to begin to learn about the amazing history of the Christian Church.     Especially Gnosticism and the early Christian Church, and especially the creation of the New Testament Bible. For a different review....here is my review of books that build on these interests, especially the \\"lost\\" books of the New Testament Bible and the concepts of Gnosticism.    Nearly all knowledgeable Biblical scholars realize there have been a wide range of writings attributed to Jesus and his Apostles..... and that some of these were selected for compilation into the book that became known as the Bible.....and that some books have been removed from some versions of the Bible and others have been re-discovered in modern times.    The attention focused on Gnosticism by Dan Brown's DaVinci Code may be debatable, but the fact is that increased attention on academics tends to be predominately positive, so I welcome those with first-time or renewed interest.  At least first-timers to Gnosticism are not pursuing the oh-so-popular legends of the Holy Grail, Bloodline of Christ, and Mary Magdalene.    This is great......I seldom quote other reviewers, but there is one reviewer of Pagels' books who confided that he had been a Jesuit candidate and had been required to study a wide range of texts but was never was told about the Nag Hamadi texts.  He said:     \\"Now I know why.  The Gospel of Thomas lays waste to the notion that Jesus was `the only begotten Son of God' and obviates the need for a formalized church when he says,  `When your leaders tell you that God is in heaven, say rather, God is within you, and without you.'  No wonder they suppressed this stuff!   The Roman Catholic Church hasn't maintained itself as the oldest institution in the world by allowing individuals to have a clear channel to see the divinity within all of us: they need to put God in a bottle, label the bottle, put that bottle on an altar, build a church around that altar, put a sign over the door, and create rubricks and rituals to keep out the dis-believing riff-raff.  Real `Us' versus `them' stuff, the polar opposite from `God is within You.'  `My God is bigger than your God' the church(s)seem to say. And you can only get there through \\"my\\" door/denomination.   But Jesus according to Thomas had it right: just keep it simple, and discover the indwelling Divinity `within you and without you.'\\"    Here are quickie reviews of what is being bought these days on the Gnostic Gospels and the lost books of the Bible in general:    The Lost Books of the Bible (0517277956) includes 26 apocryphal  books from the first 400 years that were not included in the New Testament.

This is, of course, the prequel to Da Vinci Code.  The two books together provide a remarkable popular thriller that gets to a wide range of deeper issues.  If you read Dan Brown's 2 Da Vinci Code books it is easy to find yourself interested in Gnosticism and the other issues surrounding the history of the Christian Church.  Increased attention on academics tends to be predominately positive, so I've put together this short guide for readers with first-time or renewed interest.    Nearly all knowledgeable Biblical scholars realize there have been a wide range of writings attributed to Jesus and his Apostles..... and that some of these were selected for compilation into the book that became known as the Bible.....and that some books have been removed from some versions of the Bible and others have been re-discovered in modern times.

This is fascinating......I have written a lot of reviews but it is only Pagels' readers that seem to be rating reviews based on their perception of whether or not the person's religious beliefs match their own.    These are the sort of minds and attitudes that cause terroristic fundamentalism to rear it's anti-intellectual, closed minded, intolerant head.  That is not what either Elaine Pagels or Dan Brown are about!  Here is my review that seems to have irritated these folks!

Nearly all knowledgeable Biblical scholars realize there have been a wide range of writings attributed to Jesus and his Apostles..... and that some of these were selected for compilation into the book that became known as the Bible.....and that some books have been removed from some versions of the Bible and others have been re-discovered in modern times.

I met Dr. Coulson at the parish church in Nonington several weeks ago and have since had one of the staff at the Center for Kentish Studies recommend his book so I'm really looking forward to getting it.  Coulson is history staff at the University of Kent.  The recommendation I received was based on his attention to daily life and the social implications of what we might call &quot;Castle culture&quot; in the localities.  We will see......I will post again after the book arrives.
Most readers of this one will be attracted, like I was, because it's a William Gibson novel.  When your resume includes Neuromancer and you coined the term \\"cyberspace\\" your new book tends to attract a lot of attention.  Don't be disappointed....this is a good novel.....it's just not going to set the world on fire.  With a title like pattern recognition, I was expecting a lot....what you get is a story of a coolhunter (which is a great concept based on pattern recognition used for marketing prediction) combined with an Internet video (somewhat like \\"The Ring\\"'s script) and a personal detective story (which builds on the 911 disasters - sorry, but that's a cheap shot to me).<br />The paranoia of most of Gibson's writing does come through (I refuse to ruin the book for you by giving details in a review).  This is a good story by a great writer.  If Gibson is going to build a body of work that is substantial, we can't expect each piece to be an instant classic.  Personally, I'd rather have a good or great series of works from him over the next couple of decades instead of having to settle for 2 or 3 classics.  Just my opinion.....if you agree, get this one.....you'll be pleased....which is OK for now.
My fascination with all the different Eleanor historical novels is the wide range of speculation that is generated by the facts of her life.  Savage takes this a bit far as he has Eleanor exploring sexuality with everyone possible.  He takes to heart all the rumors that were ever circulated about her:  he has her in bed with Louis, her uncle Raymond, Saladin (even though he was only 11 when they met), a Greek pirate, the troubadour Bernard of Ventadour (of course, although for awhile I thought he was going to leave him out), and of course both Henry II and his father, Count Geoffrey.  When he got to the point where he also had her experimenting with her maids, the bath maidens in Constantanople, and even with the Empress Matilda, it was too much for me.<br />Let's see, what is good about the book?  Well, Eleanor doesn't go to bed with Bernard of Clairvaux, Abbe Sugar, or the monk Galeran.  <br />I'm asking myself why I'm trying to find the 2nd volume of this one.  It certainly is questionable whether or not it is worth the time to see who else she goes to bed with.  I suppose it will be interesting to see if Savage has her taking the nuns at Frontevrault to bed after she turns 80.
A fantastically intriguing book for anyone with a decent sense of science and the industrial revolution who wants to explore a finely researched set of biographical stories about a group of the earliest of the wild amateur experimenters.  The Lunar Society's remarkable set of characters (Darwin's grandfather, Priestley, Watt, Wedgwood) are like a who's who of the famous.  The reading is a wonderful dive into the heady days of a new cultural paradigm similar to the recent silicon valley and dot.com phenomena.  Literally everything they touched turned to gold.....a great story of a small group of thinkers who were in the right place at the right time to make a marvelous series of things happen.
It's entirely possible to love or hate Ellen Jones' \\"The Fatal Crown.\\"  This is historical fiction in the tradition of Margaret George's great novels like \\"The Memoirs of Cleopatra\\" and \\"The Autobiography Of Henry VIII\\".  ...mostly it stays true to the facts of this horrible period in English history ...As with any historical novel, Jones makes up nearly all of the dialogue and she does do some wild speculation about the birth of the future Henry II.  However, she is very careful to make sure her speculation coincides with facts that are unexplainable otherwise.<br />I am a fairly good student of Eleanor and Henry II and there is not much doubt that the very popular books on Eleanor pretty much enhance her life beyond what really occurred.  This does not stop me from enjoying a good historical novel about either of them.  In this case, the speculation about the Empress Maude and King Stephen is probably fantasy, but Jones does a credible job of making sure that all the wild events fit into the known historical facts.  In fact, she is the only novelist I have yet read who came up with a plot that actually explained the bizarre swings of fortune that occurred during the long civil war between Maude and Stephen.  She keeps a very positive narration on both sides (something that so many novelists just can't seem to pull off - most just *have* to demonize one party or the other).  She has decent explanations for Maude's actions in London as well as Stephen's crazy releases of both Maude and the adolescent Henry as well as his final act of making Maude's son his heir instead of his own son Eustace.<br />When history is insane (and it certainly was during this period), I can find enjoyment in a crazy plot designed to explain the insanity.  ...
There is a definite thrill to reading the actual words set down by the infamously unassuming monk himself.  This is why there are so many fields where \\"Bede\\" is mandatory foundational literature, but if you are a student of English history, literature, theology, philosophy, or sociology you already know that.  One of the most lasting of the many images the book creates is the biography of Bede himself; surviving a plague that left only the abbot and the young boy Bede to sing the Divine Offices, then settling in at Jarrow where he was sheltered with the precious books for the remainder of his life.<br />Dated as 731, Bede's history was written in his old age (when he was 60 or so) and his gentle manner of reflection on the relationship of kings, gentry, the Church, it's priests and leaders, and common folk with one another informs one quite clearly of the many years spent teaching other monks, repeatedly re-reading texts, and living the religious life that bestowed the title \\"Venerable Bede\\" upon him.  A professional academic in every modern sense of the word, knowledgeable, inquiring, conscious of his place in history, inventor of the chronological annotation (A.D.), meticulous researcher of events, places, and times; from any perspective you choose, this book demands to be part of your life experience.<br />This edition (which is probably the best-known - it's Sherley-Price's 1955 translation)  includes both Bede's Letter to Egbert and the great eyewitness account of Bede's death by Cuthbert, upon which a significant part of Bede's reputation rests.  There is no way to read Cuthbert's letter without understanding the ideal of humility for a medieval monk.....the image of him giving away his earthly treasures of pepper, handkerchiefs and incense in the hours before he dies....it's an image that stays with you forever.<br />All in all, the work is one of the treasures of our species....
Perhaps this book is just a bit behind the coming crest of a wave of open discussion on the nature-nurture dialogue....then again, maybe this is just a sideshow to the debate on the ethos of genetic manipulation.  It's hard to tell.  From one standpoint Pinker argues that we have failed to adequately address the relationship between the genetics of personality and environmental effects on character development.  That sounds like an argument that has needed to be made for quite some time....perhaps this is the coming crest of the wave.  Then again, he is persuasive in his argument that we need to begin to focus on a balance between environmental forces and genetic predisposition.  This requires hard change from entrenched paradigms that many fear to challenge.  I'm not sure there are enough with the commitment to make this happen, but one thing that seems certain is that books like this are at least opening the door to the discourse necessary to make it possible.
No, I'm not a disgruntled grad student who had to take a qualitative eval course with this book as the bible. I'm a very happy grad student who enthusiastically pursues qualitative methods (and in fact teaches them to his undergrad students), but who learned at great expense to avoid this book at all costs.<br />A large number of professors teaching research have latched onto Patton as the qualitative guru for valid reasons. He has done seminal work in the field, championed the process for decades, and is deservedly well respected for these efforts. The problem is using his book as a classroom textbook.<br />This book is OK as a reference source, but the man is not a textbook author. The book is extremely difficult to comprehend, has not been revised significantly since the first edition in 1980, wanders off on tangents seldom related to the content (try the start of Chapter 5 if you need an example), fails to provide groundedness with adequate theoretical applications, and so on. ....I do use this book and quote from it when appropriate, but cannot recommend it as a textbook.
An incredible novel, well deserving of the awards Peter Carey has collected for his brilliant work.  I'm at a loss as to how anybody could not have heard of Ned Kelly unless they have never ventured outside American culture.  Even then, he was so concerned about his role in history, so similar to the wild west American culture heros, that he should have come up at some point.  Come on folks, the movie starred Mick Jagger......!<br />The fictional collection of papers representing a &quot;biography&quot; of Ned Kelly's gang is a well worn and proven literary device that places the reader firmly in the time period and (much more importantly in this case) into the mental framework from which Kelly's actions occured.  It really does help you sort of ooze into his state of mind, which is essential to understanding why many of his actions occurred.  For example, the poignant scene where the adolescent Ned, clueless about women or social conventions, manages to do the right thing by buying a dress for his sweetheart Mary Hearn is enough to tear your heart out.  And the language.....ah, the poetry.....how can anyone complain about the grammar or the outback colloquialisms that provide the rich texture that absolutely *makes* the story?  It's like complaining that Shakespeare is too hard to understand in the original Elizabethan English or Whitman is difficult because he wrote poetry.  When Carey can write things like, &quot;When our brave parents was ripped from Ireland like teeth from the mouth of their own history.....&quot; you have to respect the hard guts that come with it....true to real Irish culture....the music, the pubs, just *being* Irish.  Now, having had my rant on the Irish part, do you really want me to start on the Australian experience?  I'm not Australian (although I did buy this book at LAX to read on my first flight down under), but Carey is and has obviously paid attention to the hard stuff there too.  Being mistreated, unfairness, lack of respect.....it's what makes OZ take your breath away.  It's what has firmly placed the spirit of the aboriginal past as part of the national culture, it's what makes Australia a place to cherish....not perfect, never nice, but always fighting and eventually making things as right as they can be for now.<br />So, no Ned Kelly is not always a likeable person, but I bet you aren't either.  He's illiterate but Carey gives him such a strong human spirit that he manages to come close to the greats of that art....Shakespeare, Faulkner, Whitman....and all the rest.
Although he captured me with his initial quote from Shakespeare's Richard III as rationale for a practical means to insure corporate survival, I found Peter Block to be the most refreshing thinker I've yet had the privilege to study.  I used this book in a Doc course where we included a fairly lengthy conference call with Block, thus giving our rather small cohort (12 of us) a good opportunity to quiz him on some of the gritty application details.  I must admit that I finished the course with a distinct impression that Block may well be the next Deming.  Unfortunately, the mistakes of the past seem to be repeating in that although a new generation of managers understands his philosophy and may be buying into it at a fairly respectable pace, the bulk of corporate thinkers are just not willing to jeopardize the thinking that got them into place.  The problem is typical....one of my earliest lessons in administrative thinking was a CEO who told us to use that new CQI process because he was going to foster change in our org.....right up to where he told us to find a way to make sure the results of the process met his goals for the org.<br />There is no doubt that Block is challenging the big thinkers to have the guts to give up the power while still holding the responsibility.  Like Deming before him, he's a prophet with a message everybody believes in but few are willing to sacrifice adequately to reap the enlightenment.   I'm not a CEO, but I've used his principles fairly successfully the past 4 years, occasionally I can't make it work, but when it does, the results have been spectacular.  What's important for me is that I think of myself as a steward entrusted with a valuable resource.  There are some great lessons on how to do this in any serious biography of Henry II of England's administrative structure - which established the concept of English Common Law, among other achievements.  (By no stretch of imagination could Henry II be considered a modern manager, buthis concept of stewardship certainly was as radical in his day as Block and Deming in ours - the lessons of history are worthwhile.)<br />It's the subtitle of the book that provides the clue to the difficulty of the concept.....Choosing Service over Self-Interest....it's extremely hard to carry this out.  Block himself tends to simply inform those who challenge him that he cannot provide assurances of security, that if the outcome were a sure thing there would be no need for commitment, and then he sometimes talks about installing living democracy in organizations in place of autocracy.  This is radical.....so radical that the cost of believing is more than most of today's administrators can afford to risk, so perhaps the philosophy will take root in those who are listening now in anticipation of their time.  When it finally happens, the world will once again become a better place.
Most unusual for sure!  What a strange novel (and Pamela Richmond is careful to add this before her name....&quot;A Novel by...&quot;), so, lacking any additional information in a preface, introduction, biography, or note to readers, the mystery becomes trying to determine exactly how much of this novel is fiction, how much is fantasy, and how much may be based on fact.  It's really hard to tell.  Richmond does give hints.....&quot;It's because of what happened with him that I ultimately decided to choose the profession of psychology.&quot; but her father (or her fictional father in the novel) was a psychologist or counselor of one stripe or another (there was a steady stream of patients coming to their house for treatment).  So if the author is a professional psychologist, how much is she playing with us in the &quot;novel,&quot; if indeed that's what it is.  It's possible to take this book on an enticing level far beyond the naivete of the 15 year old narrator.  There are a myriad of questions about what is fiction versus what is fact, all swimming together in a misty sort of reality that actually comes close to the state of awareness that Brian Jones would have been experiencing during these last days of his life.  And the irony (boldly stated on the first page) of Richmond confessing to being (like Brian with Pat) a deserter from her own child and family.  All in all it makes for a marvelously intertwined novel, beautiful in it's simple and well informed view of English village life, innocent adolescence, and powerful personal introspection.  A masterful work on many levels!
Brooks copyrighted this herself in 1983 and, although there is no useful biographic information, I get the impression she wrote it for the k-12 school library market.  The book feels like it is written for an 8th grade audience but with an admirable extent to the vocabulary and historical contexts.  Brooks has done a good job on relating geography, medieval culture and art, and history in an enjoyable and informative read.<br />Perhaps I don't understand the prejudices of the school library market, but I do wish that books like this would do some referencing and citations of quoted material to give readers the concept of backing up what is said with authoritative research sources.<br />This is a good solid introductory book on Eleanor.  It is comprehensive (unlike so many of the newer Eleanor books that focus on and tend to glamorize only one part of her life).  It presents most of the known historical facts and mentions most of the commonly known myths as well (clearly presenting them as unfounded legend).  This is a good place to start if you want an overview of Eleanor's life.  It's a quick read for adults and a good comprehensive exploration of a medieval life for an elementary or high school student.
Filled with romantic poetry from the famous \\"courts of love\\" of ancient Aquitaine and Poitiers, Pamela Kaufman's Book of Eleanor has incredible shelf appeal.....the reviews are spectacular; Washington Post says it;s \\"absolutely splendid;\\" the Sun-Times \\"superbly written;\\"  and the Kansas City Star goes so far as to have it rivaling Chaucer's Canterbury Tales.  Wow!.....at least that's what I thought when I got my copy.  This one is written for fans of romance, not for historical novel afficionados.  Let me explain the strong points of Kaufman's writing, which are probably best said by the review from the Detroit Free Press on the back of the dust jacket, where the publishers have excerpted the phrase \\"amusing historical novel.\\"  That's the most accurate of all the reviews, with the emphasis on amusing and a focus on the romantic speculation that has surrounded the relationship between Eleanor and the troubadour Bernard of Ventadour.<br />Kaufman fans the flames of ancient speculation and creates a romance novel where Ventadour evolves into not only the legendary songsmith that he may well have been, but also a warrior knight every bit the equal of Richard the Lionhearted (who Kaufman makes not only the student of the troubadour, but also his son!)  So it's obvious that Kaufman crafts her novel around the legend that there was a romantic relationship between Eleanor and Ventadour.  This is the primary nugget of the entire tale that weaves itself into the first 30 of the 31 chapters.  The lovers engage in hidden assignations where half of Eleanor's famous \\"devil's brood\\" of infant kings-to-be are conceived along with the political revolutions that will in the end foil Henry II's empire building.  Throughout their own marriages, constant warfare, and long separations the love persists (in the tradition of the 20th century romance novel) until at long last Henry is dead, Richard is King, and the lovers are reunited in unexpected bliss for their final years together.  The fact that too many primary sources appear candid enough to speak to the chivalric love between the two while at the same time stating that it was unlikely that there was any physical relationship, places this novel well outside the realm of historical novels and solidly into the romance category.<br />What I found horrifying was the way Kaufman turns all the primary male characters in Eleanor's life into demons, with the exception of Ventadour (of course).  I realize this may be a requirement of the romance novel formula, but it is very clear that Henry II did not brazenly rape Eleanor to make her his wife and future Queen.  Alison Weir (who is a meticulous researcher) in her book on Eleanor says only \\"Eleanor sent envoys to Henry, asking him to come at once and marry her; this was not necessarily a proposal, ....for it is possible that the couple had already agreed to marry.\\"  And even in this speculation she cites the well respected Gervase of Canterbury, among other primary sources.  And I must admit that I have major problems with St. Thomas a Becket being demonized as well.  This historical facts are extremely well documented that he was not martyred at the high altar at Canterbury.  Anyone who has been there is well aware of the exact spot just inside the Martyrs Door where the Pope and Archbishop of Canterbury dedicated a new altar within the last decade.  And anyone with an elementary knowledge of forensics knows that vermin will leave a body after it cools, exactly as the contemporary accounts describe the lice and other creatures exiting the Saint's hair shirt and braises the evening of the murder.  But Kaufman's greatest sin is the way she turns Thomas into a spiritual monster with no one to defend him at his hour of need.  It is well documented by eye witnesses that Edward Grim attempted to defend Becket and nearly lost his arm as a result.<br />Eleanor is one of my favorite characters and I consider myself a serious fan of her life.  However, there were great men associated with her and they were not all demons all the time.  It pains me to see a story constructed at the expense of rejecting a considerable body of historical fact.  The legend of Eleanor continues to grow rapidly today.  Kaufman's book needs to be considered an interesting aberration, not a part of the legend, for it contains too much that is false.re great men associated with her and they were not all demons all the time.

The full title of this book is Eleanor of Aquitaine: By The Wrath Of God, Queen Of England (or at least that's the title of the copy I bought in England)....some books are worth reading just for the brilliance of the title.....to me this is THE classic work on Eleanor, it's so good I did something I rarely do.....I got my copy signed.  Weir begins with simple detail that enhances her narrative.....I knew this was going to be a great book when she took the time to differentiate names, she's still the only Eleanor author to make sure we knew that Eleanor herself would have used Alienore, not Eleanor.  The hope Weir articulated in her preface that the book would emerge as credible and balanced, stripped of myths and misunderstandings is the heart of why I cherish this one above all the other Eleanor writings.....it is largely a successful effort at what Weir herself calls \\"more like a....detective work than a conventional historical biography.\\"  An absolutely wonderful work.....and very much appreciated.<br />Here's an example of how Weir works her magic:  The historical facts surrounding Eleanor's marriage to Henry are nicely presented with a minimum of speculation.  For example, Weir says only \\"Eleanor sent envoys to Henry, asking him to come at once and marry her; this was not necessarily a proposal, ....for it is possible that the couple had already agreed to marry.\\"  And even in this speculation she cites Gervase of Canterbury.  The entire text runs like this.....facts predominate, speculation is limited to where Weir's opinion as a researcher well-embedded in the sources of the period has a value.  Although I'm primarily an Eleanor fan, this book inspired me to read the rest of Weir's works, and she has done an excellent job on Henry VIII, Elizabeth, the Two Princes, and the Wars of the Roses......so now I guess I'm an Alison fan too.  She has produced some of the most enjoyable reading of the past decade for me.
Kelly is a Harvard academic writing immediately after WWII (this book was published in 1950).  With the huge number of historical fiction works now available on Eleanor, it is interesting to see what the primary sources actually say about her, the people who surrounded her, the places and the times.  Kelly uses most of the now recognized primary sources so this work is a fairly good summary of the known facts about Eleanor and her period in history.<br />If you have read any of the historical fiction concerning Eleanor, this is a great reality check.  It's fun to find the actual characters upon which some of the fiction was based....for example, the troubadour Bernard, about whom so many tales of romance with Eleanor are built, is carefully followed from his arrival at Henry and Eleanor's first court through the famous lyrics in which he celebrates her beauty and charm.  There are many other similar examples, all making Kelly's work well worth the time to read if you are a dedicated fan of Eleanor or this period in France or England.
Authorized or not (and this one is not), you won't find a better set of stories and facts about the band, not even in their own books and interviews. Why? Well, because author Stephen Davis is a professional journalist, an excellent wordsmith (although he sometimes waxes a bit too poetic), and most importantly, a great critical analyst capable of giving unbiased information from a wide range of sources so that you can make your own judgment. You see, the problem with nearly all the Stones' books is the limited scope of the author, their own strong biases or the time period or limited access they were granted. Davis overcomes this problem by thorough research (I suspect he may have a research team although he doesn't say), by getting to seminal sources in an attempt to avoid the biases of non-first hand information, and by actually checking and correlating documented sources.<br />Now, about the book itself: What a title! Davis has the greatest book titles I've ever seen. I would buy and read it just on that alone, but perhaps I should talk a bit about what's actually IN the book, so here goes:<br />Part One on the formation of the band is the best and most coherent story of all the famous events (and I've read most of the accounts by other authors, including the Stones themselves). Davis has the chronology and the details down extremely well. It is obvious that Alexis Korner and Cyril Davies brought it all together, but a good understanding of how Brian met Korner and ended up as Elmo Lewis backed by Charlie Watts the night Mick, Keith, and Dick Taylor first saw him is really a first in the Stones literature. The Blue Boys tapes that Mick, Keith, and Taylor did in 1962 are explained (as well as Mick's 50,000 pound auction bid to retain control of them in May of 1995 after they were rediscovered in a Dartford attic), the incredible discord between the individual Stones is very well related (with lots of specific incidents), details of what happened before and after many of the famous shows, the personal relationships, screw ups, and conflicts gives an insight that the Stones themselves have tried to avoid repeatedly. The image that emerges is one that is best typified by Keith's oft-repeated story of the Dartford Station train incident in October of 1960, when he met Mick with the albums under his arm. Keith sometimes waxes poetic about how they made a deal just like Robert Johnson at the crossroads and about how the Band will survive regardless of what else happens. And you can't fault Keith or anyone else on this one....because he's right.....the Band still exists......chaotic history and all....what is remarkable is that they survived.....and you will not understand what that means until you see the story from Davis' perspective....in this book. I honestly can say that without reading this one, you cannot claim to know what the Stones are still all about, Old Gods or not.<br />Oh, and just to prove that Davis is not perfect, I did find one fact he could have checked a bit more. Karnbach and Bernson, in their great documentary work \\"It's Only Rock And Roll: The Ultimate Guide To The Rolling Stones\\", state that they did talk to Mick Avory about the drummer situation before Charlie joined. Mick said he sat in at the Bricklayer's Arms when the band was first forming but did not play the first Marque Jazz Club date on July 12, 1962.
Ann Obergfell is an attorney and radiologic sciences professor who has become an authority on medical and labor law issues related to the radiologic and medical imaging sciences. This text misses very little, it has full chapters on not only the traditional areas such as negligence and malpractice, documentation, standards of care and patient rights, ethics, & risk management, but also addresses critical areas such as labor law, discrimination in employment, safety, whistleblower protections, and issues for education of students in clinical centers.<br />The strength of the text is in its down-to-earth applicability combined with a strong academic undercurrent with proper citations and references to case law as well as the literature of legal issues in the professions.<br />This is the one med law text that needed to be written.....now it's available.....if you are serious about administration, professional issues, or education, you really need to have this one on your shelf.
Published in 1982, Aftel's book does a good job of providing narrative and photos of Brian's life and death.  Aftel is/was a psychotherapist in Berkeley and she does a very credible job of presenting the details (with lots of very good photos).  She does not get into the stories about the possible murder, although she does report on the thefts that occurred at Cotchford Farm immediately after he died.  If you would like to hear the murder story, get the CD from Geoffrey Guiliano \\"Brian Jones: The Lost Stone\\" which is sometimes part of the 3 CD set \\"The Rolling Stones Interviews\\" on LaserLight.
Author Stanley Booth had the ultimate access to the Stones.  He managed to get a contract for a book on the Band, found access, and convinced the Stones themselves to authorize his work as well as let him accompany them on the 69-70 tours,  just before the infamous stuff of Altamont happened.  By managing to last with the Stones, over time actually becoming one of the rare friends who could find and hang out with the Band members, he acquired an incredible store of tales, which he tells in a remarkably literary manner in this book.  Using quotes from the likes of Norman Mailer, &quot;Hambone,&quot; the Crystals, Cynthia Plastercaster (if you don't know about her, you really need to get this book), Booth clearly demonstrates his credentials as a serious author.  The book benefits.....the best story of the writing of Satisfaction by the Holiday Inn pool in Clearwater is in here as are the tales of Mick and Keith's arrival at Altamont (not at all what you would suspect).  All in all, this is one of the good ones and you can't go wrong by taking time to read it cover to cover.
A great picture book.  Excellent quality photos (>130 of them) of the Stones, the people who surrounded them through the various eras of their careers, the places and stage sets, recording sessions, etc.  If you are looking for information, stories, or accurate data, you would do better to get Bill's book \\"Stone Alone\\" or a good guide like Karnbach and Bernson's \\"It's Only Rock `n' Roll\\" or Jimmy Phlege's \\"Nankering\\" or even the oldest Stones book - Goodman's \\"Our Own Story.\\"<br />Author Steve Appleford did not have access to any of the Stones.  Apparently the closest he came was the last row of the L.A. Coliseum  Steel Wheels tour in 89....he goes so far as to envy a friend who saw the Stones in 72......jeesh....I've been closer to them than that.....and I saw them in 72 too.  Ok, he did interview Marianne Faithful, Bobby Keys, Bobby Womack and a few others, but come on, man.....when you use photo captions like \\"The Glimmer Twins, hard at work on the devil's music;\\" totally miss the difference between the U.K. and U.S. releases of Out Of Our Heads, Aftermath, and Between The Buttons in your discography; and have nothing to say about the unreleased tracks like the early demos That Girl Belongs To Yesterday, Sure I Do, Shang A Doo Lang, or the lost 67 single English Summer, you really shouldn't lay claim to any sort of authority about the Stones other than being a fan, just like the rest of us.
Let me quote Little Richard.....\\"You Got It - Oh, Baby, You Got It\\"  This is the most authoritative guide I've found on the Band.  Absolutely great chronology, concert data (often with set lists), sessionography, discography (both US and UK), films, TV, promotionals, and even a decent shot at the bootlegs.  There are lots of notes and details......great listings of which sessions produced all the unreleased takes, so you can finally get your bootleg collection in order.......there is an unreleased version of Beast of Burden with different lyrics on the 8 track (the 8 TRACK!), there is a photo of the 1st gig advert at the Marquee Club, they solved the old legend of the Kink's Mick Avory serving as drummer at the first Marque Jazz Club date on July 12, 1962 by (why not?) asking Avory (get the book to find out the truth).  There are dozens of similar nuggets......this is (as the cover states) the ultimate guide to the Rolling Stones.<br />It's Only Rock 'n' Roll...ain't that the truth......<br />Note: Be careful not to mix this book up with the similarly titled \\"The Rolling Stones: It's Only Rock 'n' Roll: The Stories Behind Every Song\\" or Rolling Stones: It's Only Rock and Roll: Song by Song\\" both by Steve Appleford and both poor quality, or It's Only Rock 'N' Roll: My On-The-Road Adventures With the Rolling Stones \\" by Chet Flippo .
This is a totally absorbing, sparkling romp over the just completed millennium of European history.  A fantastic job, although I will agree with other reviewers that this can be a tough read if you are not already familiar with much of the range of ethnic and national history.<br />Davies clearly states his premise in the Introduction.....his desire to provide a single volumn survey that provides an evenly magnified view from both the number of pages per year and the geographic/ethnic perspective of the writer.  His objective is to avoid focusing on recent centuries or recently predominant cultures at the expense of more distant or less studied times or regions.  This alone is a worthy effort and makes the entire tome almost an obligatory read for a serious amateur historian like myself.<br />Davies provides several ingenious aids to your perspective as you plow through this vast field of information.  There are 300 capsules that entertain as well as provide tangential sideshows.  (Did you know that Pope John Paul II approved the exhumation of Elizabeth of Austria's tomb in 1973 in an attempt to foser Polish patriotism, yet 16 people may have died from the bacilli that were released?  Or, how about stretching your mind by trying to comprehend the horror of Stalin's genocidal act of state policy as he created an artificial famine by cordoning off the Ukraine in 1932-3 until 7 million people were dead?)  This is a powerful book.<br />Even better is the orientation of the European maps throughout the book so that you are looking at them with the west uppermost, thus viewing the continent as the first settlers (and more importantly, central and eastern Europeans) perceived their relationships.  Especially for those of us with anglized perspectives, it's a very good thing to see the distance and small scale with which the western European nations hold by comparison with the mass of the rest of the continent.<br />This book is remarkable in the unique perceptual orientations it provides.  When added to the balanced approach of the quantity of text, there is a true effort to provide a non-western European view and this is very much needed.  A great job and a worthy read for anyone serious about the past of our species.
Penman emerged long ago as one of the best historical novelists and continues to solidify her reputation with each new release. Her special genius lies in the bright and shining historical detail that she can weave into both plot and dialog (she's a very good student of history and at times is absolutely brilliant in conveying to us the workings of medieval minds).<br />Chronologically, this is the 2nd of her novels. It's also the 2nd in the Henry & Eleanor trilogy (the others are When Christ & His Saints Slept and Devil's Brood).<br />There is no doubt this trilogy will stand as a superior work for ages to come. There is certainly a very complex plot (because this era of English history was quite convoluted). Penman does an excellent job of keeping it all straight for us as she leads us through the maze of characters. Yes, it's complicated but if you read the history of these times you quickly come to see what a great job she did in her design of the story.<br />There are touching moments (the private verbal dueling between Henry & Eleanor are always memorable) and Penman is great at establishing dynamic moments for a wide range of events (the machinations of Becket, etc.). Although I suspected it was coming, I still found her negative characterization of Becket to be an amazing perspective (that I can easily imagine coming from the very mind of Henry himself - a remarkable piece of writing by Penman).<br />As always, Penman's true genius is the broad historical scope that is painted on top of the shimmering details of brief moments. It truly does feel as if you are living the story yourself, and it is this bringing us readers in as witnesses that stands as Penman's contribution to the art of the<BR>historical novel.<br />If you prefer to read in chronological order:<BR>1101-1154 When Christ And His Saints Slept (Vol 1 of  the Henry & Eleanor Trilogy)<BR>1156-1171 Time And Chance (Vol 2 of   the Henry & Eleanor Trilogy)<BR>12th Cent Devil's Brood (Vol 3 of   the Henry & Eleanor Trilogy)- not yet released<BR>1192-1193 The Queen's Man<BR>1193 Cruel As The Grave<BR>1183-1232 Here Be Dragons (Vol 1 of Welsh Trilogy)<BR>1231-1267 Falls The Shadow (Vol 2 of Welsh Trilogy)<BR>1271-1283 The Reckoning (Vol 3 of Welsh Trilogy)<BR>1459-1492 The Sunne In Splendour
This is the final episode in Penman's Welsh Trilogy.  It follows Here Be Dragons and Falls The Shadow, running from 1271-1283.<br />Penman emerged long ago as one of the best historical novelists and continues to solidify her reputation with each new release.

If you read the history of these times you quickly come to see what a great job she does in her design of the story.<br />I have no problem with Penman's romantic feelings about her heros. From Eleanor in the 1st trilogy to Joanna in Here Be Dragons to her raising the standard of Simon de Montfort as a visionary (but historically too early) icon of democracy, she does use them as a vehicle to carry  forward a dynamic presentation of history....all in the best traditions of the historical novel.<br />Penman's true genius is the broad historical scope that is painted on top of the shimmering details of brief moments.

A 2nd episode for DeQuincy, Queen Eleanor's \\"man\\" from the mind of Sharon Penman.  Her feel for the medieval England of Henry & Eleanor from her previous historical novels form the basis for this unique historical murder mystery set in England in 1193, which also serves as a nice encore for the first murder mystery \\"The Queen's Man\\".<br />Penman emerged long ago as one of the best historical novelists and continues to solidify her reputation with each new release.

A unique creation by Sharon Penman, DeQuincy, is placed in a medieval secret agent role as Queen Eleanor's \\"man\\".  Although I was skeptical at first, I found Penman's feel for the medieval England of Henry & Eleanor from her previous historical novels sets such a great stage for the storyline that I couldn't help but be drawn into her tale, which is set in England in 1192-1193.  In fact, I also found the follow up \\"Cruel As The Grave\\" worthwhile.<br />Penman emerged long ago as one of the best historical novelists and continues to solidify her reputation with each new release.

In spite of my personal opinion (which is admittedly biased), this collection of stories will compete on anyone's bookshelf for the best work of medical lit yet written.  This *is* John Stone, the physician, the human hands, the poet, the wit, it's all in here.<br />Where to start?....Blue Baby is where John started by connecting a nursery rhyme with tetralogy of Fallot; An Infected Heart (which I've read to my students for &gt;10 years now.....sometimes half the class is in tears by the time I reach the end where they inevitably gasp with comprehension of their own relationships with patients); Breath; Missed Signals; Balloon Man, it's a long and enjoyable list.<br />Reading and re-reading these gives you a sense of place within medicine (and reminds you exactly how grand those little events really are), it's a solid base from which to teach, it's wonder at the craft of an excellent wordsmith like Stone.<br />If you are in medicine, if you teach, if you are human.....read this one, you'll be glad you did.
Because John Stone has had considerable success (and continued to add fans) with his previous books Renaming The Streets and In All This Rain (among others), many of us have become familiar with his style, so his very special insight and (as one reviewer said) his ability as a master choreographer of words were not new to me.  I suspect anyone who reads this book as their first contact with Stone will add the joy of these discoveries.<br />This one has &quot;This Kind Of Thing Doesn't Happen Often....&quot; another Stone classic....soapbubbles in traffic with his signature stab at your heart; his hand poem to Delese Wear (I don't think there is such a thing as a Stone anything without a hand reference - and Delese probably still sends him poems); American Gothic (I too love the Art Institute...eventually Stone will have written a poem to every painting in the building); but I too think this book will be remembered for the Oxford poems.....they are typical Stone....finely crafted, imagery you can taste/smell/feel, and with that patented twist at what makes you tick.<br />If you want to know John Stone I would start with Renaming The Streets or In All This Rain, or even with the short stories of Country of Hearts...then, when you know the man add this one to your bookshelf.  I keep my Stone books on the shelf in my office where I can see them in my daily work.....it makes me feel good to know he's in here with me.
The Stones have always attracted so much attention it should be no surprise to anyone that books about them are also controversial.  Yes, Sanchez had a rep as a dealer (stories about him and Keith while living in France have been around a long time), but it's important to realize that whereas Wyman's &quot;Stone Alone&quot; shares Bill's memories and perspective, this book tells you how Sanchez remembers it.....you have to put them all together to get your own picture of what the Band was like (and it is fair to assume that Sanchez has made up some of the conversations to flesh out events he was connected with but probably did not hear - or was capable of remembering - the exact words).
Written in 1990, this is a very well written inside look at how the Stones developed.  Wyman has kept good notes and uses them to full advantage to give you a rationale look at the music, business, and lifestyle of the band from 64 though 90.  There are details that have not previously been revealed about the early shows, the American tours, Brian, the drug busts in London,  it goes on and on.....extremely interesting to anyone a bit fanatical about the Stones (but who else would be reading this review?).....this one is original material, not a fan ripoff and definitely worth your money......
This is certainly the best &quot;story of the Stones&quot; book.  Phelge manages to present the story straight out, with an excellent memory for detail.  When he drops names (and there are lots) you really don't get the feeling he's dropping names, it just somebody else who was around at the time.<br />Although many of the stories have been told by Phelge to other writers before and have sort of become part of the Stones legend, it's great to hear the whole thing from beginning to end from the man himself.<br />If you only buy one Stones book, this is a great choice.<br />If you want one book that provides a window on the early 60s London music scene, this is it.<br />If you want a book that tells a great story about a group of naive guys trying to be a band, this is it.  There are not ridiculous stories about parties, but when they screw around, you get the feeling you were there yourself.....a very nice writing job and well worth the trouble to find and read.
This is now a hallowed classic, yes it's dated (set in the 70s) but that doesn't stop the impact and the occasional period point (like the sexual promiscuity) is easily overlooked.<br />I met Shem  (a pseudoname)in the 80s at a meeting (he's a psychiatrist from Boston) and although I'm sure other reviewers have met him as well, he was very much full of himself with us.  Most of us were not impressed....especially since he was not open to any criticisms of either his book or the issues surrounding patient care failings of the American health care system.<br />That said, the book should be required reading for anyone serious about a medical career.  But you should read better stuff as well....start with any poem or story by John Stone, William Carlos Williams' Doctor Stories, Richard Selzer's books (especially Letters To A Young Doctor), and Jay Katz' The Silent World of Doctor and Patient.
First of all, it's OK to read this review without spoiling the story for you (I really hate when people do that).<br />If you read the other reviews you will quickly see that there are many of us who have read Dream Park numerous times and consider it among that small band of visionary science fiction tales.  Niven has several books on my short list (Mote In Gods Eye is at the top).<br />Although gamers will love the story, it is a well written science fiction piece, and also works well as a murder mystery.  Some of the technical innovations are now showing their age (fan fold computer paper, etc.) but with the incredible growth of both e-gaming and the huge multi-million dollar amusement/game/fantasy complexes in Orlando, there is a natural symbiosis just waiting to happen.  This is not Jurrasic Park or anything like that....this is a classic science fiction approach to what could become.....and as Niven is one of the great SciFi writers of all time.....as well articulated as you will find in any great literary work.
As a college physics teacher, and like many other reviewers, I too found the content of this abridged version of Feynman's famous lectures not worth the price of the book, but as I listened to the tapes (and by the way, several are extremely poor quality), it occured to me that the brilliance that comes through is Feynman the Educator, not the Nobel Laureate, or physicist, or college professor......and from this standpoint this set is well worth both the cost and time to anyone who fancies themself as a teacher.  I have degrees in education and get great reviews from my students on a regular basis, but that didn't stop me from learning a lot from Feynman about how to expand a student's perception, application, and analysis skills and for this addition to my own personal bag of skills, I thank him.
Although the title is certainly somewhat misleading, this is a good sourcebook of the best teaching techniques culled from a wide range of instructional situations.  There is something here for everyone in every situation, elementary ed, high school, community college, and yes, those of us at universities too.<br />I can't imagine many educators who will not find something to improve their teaching effectiveness in this book.  A great advantage is that each technique is presented individually so that you can literally pick and choose and then try them out without having to read extensively to understand the potential for each.<br />If you teach (this is my 25th year teaching college), I recommend two books once you have spent a few years at it and want to continue to improve your effectiveness....this one and Nobel Laureate Richard Feynman's &quot;Six Easy Pieces&quot;
Norris is quite amazing, having overcome the natural fault of looking at the world through her previous pre-conceptions...i.e., a New Yorker who just has to comment on how different real small town life is.  She is one of the few who can actually convey the essence of a small town (and her credibility is strengthened by her fair mention of both pros and cons).<br />My Dad had an uncle who homesteaded in Lemon, SD (where Norris lives) and I spent most summers on my Mom's family's ranch on the James River.  Norris helped me understand what all those years were really about.<br />The stark spirituality of her monastic experiences are powerful.  This is why the book is not a slow read (as many have commented)....it is a quiet read.....and from that forgotten strength in our busy world, this book is a remarkable refuge.<br />Read this in quiet.....understand small town life on the starkly beautiful great northern plains......and become a better person for the time you give Norris' writing.  I predict you will find another small piece to the puzzle of where you fit into the great scheme of things....whether it be your religious beliefs or your sense of history, geography, art, or self....it's in there and she will help you to reach it in her own quiet and mysterious way.
Yes, yes, we know Pressfield's great at battle detail and historically accurate story lines.  More important in this work is the brilliant choice of character (Alcibiades) and the narrative technique of using two narrators (Jason &amp; Polemides).  Then the plot thickens.....Socrates shares the jail with Polemides and enters the script as well......Jason &amp; Polemides have their own tangled web to unweave......this is a great novel that rises far above the thunder of the battle to enter the realm of a psychological analysis of democracy, theocracy, and a slew of both the finest and basest of human motivations.<br />This one wins on all levels.....Pressfield is cementing a beautiful reputation on these works.

If you read the history of these times you quickly come to see what a great job she does in her design of the story.<br />There may be a bit too much time spent on the romance of Llewelyn and Joanna, but there does seem to be a calculated story line running that proves itself as the bond between the two weaves itself into the historical facts of the complex relationship between King John and Llewelyn. Penman's true genius is the broad historical scope that is painted on top of the shimmering details of brief moments. It truely does feel as if you are living the story yourself, and it is this bringing us readers in as witnesses that stands as Penman's contribution to the art of the historical novel.<br />If you prefer to read in chronological order:<BR>1101-1154 When Christ And His Saints Slept (Vol 1 of Trilogy)<BR>1156-1171 Time And Space (Vol 2 of Trilogy)<BR>12th Cent Devil's Brood (Vol 3 of Trilogy)- not yet released<BR>1192-1193 The Queen's Man<BR>1193 Cruel As The Grave<BR>1183-1232 Here Be Dragons (Vol 1 of Welsh Trilogy)<BR>1231-1267 Falls The Shadow (Vol 2 of Welsh Trilogy)<BR>1271-1283 The Reckoning (Vol 3 of Welsh Trilogy)<BR>1459-1492 The Sunne In Splendour
Author Jim Gabler does Jefferson wine evenings at Monticello on occasion.  I have yet to catch him there, but not for trying.  It is my understanding that he has a passionate hobby in the historical antecedents for wines and from this standpoint, this book succeeds remarkably.  Extremely well documented - he has found items as obscure as the inventories of not only the wines Jefferson ordered during his travels, but sometimes the exact foods he ordered for specific evenings....(50 oysters and a half bottle of wine at the Amsterdam Arms...and repeated the feat the next night with a friend).  There are maps, engravings, modern photographs, historical details.....a wonderful book detailing a great wine connoisseur's travels in search of the meticulous details of the art.  And it's all laid out for you to enjoy or replicate as you may....or imagine what it would be like to travel, explore, dine, and taste as Jefferson or Gabler.
This is the 2nd book in the Wales trilogy (the others are Here Be Dragons and The Reckoning). Penman emerged long ago as one of the best historical novelists and continues to solidify her reputation with each new release. Her special genius lies in the bright and shining historical detail that she can weave into both plot and dialog (she's a very good student of history and at times is absolutely brilliant in conveying to us the workings of medieval minds).<br />One of the great things about Penman (and this book showcases it well) is her plots are always complex (because the history of these times was quite convoluted). She does an excellent job of keeping it all straight for us as she leads us through the maze of characters. If you read the history of these times you quickly come to see what a great job she does in her design of the story.<br />I have no problem with Penman's romantic feelings about her heros. From Eleanor in the 1st trilogy to Joanna in Here Be Dragons to her raising the standard of Simon de Montfort as a visionary (but historically too early) icon of democracy, she does use them as a vehicle to carry forward a dynamic presentation of history....all in the best traditions of the historical novel.<br />Penman's true genius is the broad historical scope that is painted on top of the shimmering details of brief moments.

Although Penman may be paying court to the Richard III Society, the controversy is strengthened (I still think he killed the kids). OK, so I'm not very open minded on Richard.....but Penman had me convinced throughout the read that I was wrong. This speaks well for her reputation as one of the best historical novelists. This is where she started. Her special genius lies in the bright and shining historical detail that she can weave into both plot and dialog (she's a very good student of history and at times is absolutely brilliant in conveying to us the workings of medieval minds).<br />I have no problem with Penman's romantic feelings about her heros.

Although academics may dismiss Wood's populist histories both in print and on TV, he has a rare knack of connecting history with the daily life of us common folk and that alone makes him worth reading.<br />This 1999 work follows up on his other &quot;In Search...&quot; (Dark Ages, Trojan War, Alexander the Great, First Civilizations, Domesday).  Essentially the series excavates legends and myths, some famous, some obscure, and relates a story about finding or visiting the site of the original.<br />In this one, Wood investigates the last wooden bowl turner in England, tracks a millenium old continuously used farmstead, the long argued site of Athelstan's 937 victory, Bede's church at Jarrow...15 in all...and all supplemented with judiciously chosen artwork.<br />A wonderful winter's night read in the classic sense of a soft chair, warm fire, nice drink, and favorite pet....with the place all to yourself.....this one can take you there.
I have been working and doing some traveling in Peru the past 3 summers and have used Lonely Planet throughout.  This year was my 2nd on the new green 4th ed.  Although the regions I have visited have been quite out-of-the-way (in Moquegua &amp; Amazonias) for the most part LP has it down OK.  There are some things that are just wrong, but they do a good job of paying attention to those of us who write in with corrections and updates so when you buy an edition, it is often the best information available.  The greatest advantage to LP is how comprehensive it is plus the concise text with decent maps do help considerably.<br />I can strongly recommend sticking with LP regardless of whether you are sticking to tourist areas or making an attempt to interact with the real spirit of Peru by getting out and meeting people in the less well-traveled regions.
