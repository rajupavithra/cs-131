It's a good book, but not quite what I expected when I made the purchase.  The author writes about her trip in 1999 through the Ukraine, Belarus Lithuani, Latavia, Estonia, Finland, and then across Russia to Vladivostok.  She writes snapshot views into her journey, and while the snapshots are presented in cronological order they don't always connect. For example, in one chapter she's riding a train.  The next opens with her getting off a bus.  The book doesn't cover the sites she's there to visit, but instead focuses in on the journey itself.<br />If you're looking for some light reading about traveling, this book fits the bill.  Only most people are more interested in what happens at each stop on the trip, and don't need to know the details of catching the train, checking into the hotel, or attempting to deal with getting a visa registered or hotels to stamp the visa.  Some of the detail is useful, as the process *is* different and could be mind-bending for someone not prepared for it.<br />I was also shaking my head as we see the author (who is making the trip after a multi-year business trip to help reform Russia) attempting to use legaleze to force people to give her the same price as a Russian citizen.  (It's expected that forigners will pay more for things like hotels, bus tickets, train rides, etc.  Forget the clause in the Russian Constitution -- no one abides by it.  Which is what the author finally realizes after weeks of arguing.)
The book covers so much ground that it can't go into any depth, but that doesn't stop the authors from giving a complete view of the highlights of Russia history. It starts before the Mongol horde invaded, and continues through Yeltsen, and ends with Putin's taking office. (And with a 2001 publication date, that's about all you could expect!)<br />For those interested in more information, the books lists it's sources (broken down by chapter), as well as a recommended reading list. It also includes a list of rulers, and a timeline that starts at 830 BCE!
The book isn't perfect, but it doesn't need to be.  It tells about the foibles that the author ran into during her time in Moscow.  Rather than attempting to explain everything, she focuses in on some things that occured and tells those stories.  Her writing is very easy to read and follow, making the book fairly hard to put down.  (I ended reading it over an 8 hour period, taking a lunch and Snood break in the middle.)<br />I'm sure I'll re-read this book for the sheer entertainment value...

The subtitle title of the book, 'political change from Gorbachev to Putin', defines what you expect to find between it's pages. Only that's not what's covered. McFaul covers the Gorbechev years, as well as Yeltsen's presidency -- but only until 1996. There is virtually nothing after 1996. I would expect that Putin's coverage would be light, given a publication date of 2001, but to skip over Yeltsen's final years is simply neglegent.<br />By giving only a few sentances to the 'Shares for Rubles' program, he skips over the criminal neglegance and fraud that occured. This behavior had strong impacts on the Russian economy, which directly caused the crash of their economy in 1998. This crash is skipped over completely -- possibly because at the time, as a reporter, McFaul was cheering Anatoly Chubais the mastermind and archetect behind the economic reforms. (If Chubais attempted to do what he did in the US, he would be spending a lot of time behind bars.) In short, it looks like McFaul is skipping over the time period when his journalism was (effectively) cheering on the corruption.<br />The complete failure of the economy (which -- to reiterate -- was skipped over completely), combined with the treatment of the oligarchs (also skipped over) directly led shaped the Russian perception of democracy and the free market. These factors also directly effected the conclusions at the end of his book, but he presents no explination as to why the results are so bad -- probably because the explination would involve covering the ground he choose to skip over. To skip over these major milestones is unforgivable for an author who is attempting to track the political and economic reforms in Russia.<br />On the positive side, he does give a lot of good information, and there are a lot of references to look up additional data. I would recommend this book for someone researching Russia up to, but not after, Yeltsen's re-election. And even then, it helps to have an idea of the issues he doesn't talk about.
The book is very detailed and concise, and yet written in a style that is almost painful to read.  Very dry and monotonous.  You can easily imagine an university professor droning the words of the book.<br />Well researched, a lot of information, but not something that can be casually read.  Written in a very dry style...
I highly reccomend this book, not just for those who are interested in the challenges that come with Russian-American marriage, but also for those people who have grown up with the US mindset and wish to learn more about the Russian mindset.<br />Not every story in this book is a happy one.  But that matches up with real life.  I know two Russian-American couples -- one failed, and the other succeeded.<br />Reading this book will help you not only understand the Russian mindset, but will also help prepare you for potiental problems down the road, if you choose to enter into this sort of relationship.<br />How people adapt to their new lives in their new country varies from person to person, and this book shows how different people can react differently to the same thing.  And yet it ties radically different actions to a similar mind-set.<br />The book isn't perfect, and has a few minor flaws.  (For instance, they claim the concept/word \\"&#1057;&#1077;&#1082;&#1088;&#1077;&#1090;&#1085;&#1086;&#1089;&#1090;&#1100;\\" (privacy) doesn't exist in the Russian language.)  But despite the few errors, it is well worth the read.  As a plus, it's a very easy read.  Once I started on the book, I found that I was unable to stop...
I really enjoyed this book.  It is outstandingly well written, and keeps on the plot-line of the Eight Doctor, expanding the story bit by bit.<br />If you've been following the books, this is a wonderful addition to the  storyline.<br />Also, it is great to see a Crossover story between the Cuthulu  mythos and the Dr. Who world.<br />I highly recommend this book.
