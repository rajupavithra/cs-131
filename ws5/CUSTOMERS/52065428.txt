I really enjoy the writing style of Jon Krakauer. I have read all three of his previous books. To me, Under the Banner of Heaven contains all of the strengths of his other non-fiction narrative book, Into the Wild, about Chris McCandless (Into Thin Air, his other narrative, is my favorite book). Like Into the Wild, Under the Banner is an exhaustively researched work, complete with first hand accounts of the places mentioned in the narrative as well as interviews with available persons who lived the story. These elements, combined with Krakauer's rich vocabulary and straight but elegant prose make Jon Krakauer my favorite author. Like Krakauer, I have always found mormons to be fascinating, but knew little about their history. To me, he said many good things about the mainstream LDS Church and their history: I found the narrative of Brigham Young leading the LDS's to Utah totally amazing. A fantastic read!
