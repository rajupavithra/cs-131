I had a comprehensive exam to cover all of my core classes as the end of my MBA, in place of a dissertation.  Having sold all of my books on Amazon (oops) after finishing the individual classes, I needed something to catch me back up in all the core disciplines.  Well this book didn't quit do it.  It was good in the more numberless skills such as strategy, marketing and some econimics but fell way short of the mark in the more number intensive areas of statistics, finance, and accounting.  When I say way short of the mark, I don't believe you could find even the subject for the latter three areas in the book.  It is a decent reference and provides good information on the areas it covers but I would expect more from a 'desk reference'.
Research and thought are an important aspect to any study.  When reading God's Word, it is especially important to know exactly what He said.  This is our guide for life and the most ipmortant method for us to know Him.  The Lord tells us in the Bible that the Bible is spiritually discerned.  I believe that is why some have so much trouble with the King James.  They are not studying it.  They want a novel that they can breeze through.  God packed  all the instructions for your entire life into this relatively small book (look at the manual your mechanic has for your car).  If you want to read books like the New Believer's Bible, do it with a KJV in hand.  It is God's preservd Word and will not lead you astray.  If you have trouble understanding a passage, use these other books as a reference.  Then you can make a judgement as to what the scripture states.  If you start out reading an 'understanding or belief' of what a passage means, you may start off wrong.  Please use a KJV as your principle Bible.  All other books are, at the most, commentary.
In modern times where any bit of 'entertainment' can leave you feeling a bit down, its nice to have something that lets you walk away with a smile.  The quality writing and uplifting story with solid values can make you feel grounded as well as full of hope.  The world is an amazing place and though this book is fiction, it gives a positive perspective that may help you get a fresh focus.  The characters from Mitford always have something going on and Father Tim seems like someone that you could really enjoy knowing.
