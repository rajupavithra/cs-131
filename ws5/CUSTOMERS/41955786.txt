I got this book in 1998 to read a bit about the man before he was to pass away a few years later. For this reason the book is probably a bit dated now and does not cover his Eyes Wide Shut production. However in terms of insight I remember this is a great guide for introducing us into the life and times of the man. It covers his youth and upbringing and how he got into the film making scene. There are many references to Kirk Douglas and film financing, including Kubrick's interaction with Hollywood. In terms of a historical reference, this book was very interesting and I would recommend it in terms of being able to give us an account of the ins and outs of this man's life. The photograph section is quite well detailed with lots of early stuff. However the one downside to the book is that it never touches on Kubrick's motives. Anyway Kubrick was an illusive character. I have seen maybe two very small 1 minute interviews with the man in my life. If you are looking for insider information then you may want to read something like, Eyes Wide Open : A Memoir of Stanley Kubrick (Paperback)<br /><br />by Frederic Raphael, although this book was denounced by Kubrick's family, and to be taken with a pinch of salt, it is still interesting none the less.
Marty Strauss, an ex-con, is always interested in a gamble. Chance and a bit of luck on his side sees him gain employment as a bodyguard for Joseph Whitehead, a wealthy man who also gambles, but gambles with the forces of evil in an ancient game that has earned him wealth, power and immortality... put at a price. Strauss is directed to protect his master from the servants of Lucifer as they come back to seek what is theirs. With the power to raise the dead the scene is set for a battle between gangsters and demons. This is Barker's first full novel outside of his Books of Blood short stories. It is an excellent introduction into his creative fantasy mind.
The big downside to these volumes is that they eventually split in half! However... I also own a stack of other film encyclopedias but for weight and manageability this is the best of the lot. The book is around 2 inches thick - but is the size of a novel and you can hold it in one hand. It is a full resource (with over 18,000 titles!), easy to carry around and has a full listing of directors and cast at the back along with Oscar winners. Overall the reviews are not very good and they are limited to just four of five lines at best. I mostly do not use it for the reviews though. It is more of a \\"find a director or star that you like and quickly flick through the index and the corresponding works to see what else they have done\\". For that it is very impressive but if you are looking for in-depth reviews then you should go elsewhere for the more unmanageable volumes and Arnold Schwarzenner to help carry them around for you.

The original David Cronenberg starts here with Kafka's `The Metamorphosis', a novella that takes a premise like evolution and reverses it for the protagonist, Gregor Samsa, who awakes one morning from a nightmare to find his body mutated into a giant insect that is stuck on its back. This incident lasts for 100 pages as Kafka describes the moments and thoughts going through the poor mutated man's mind. Certainly a psychological horror classic and can be read in the space of a few lunch hours. Not a bad place to start with Kafka.
Although this is meant to be looked at more than read, you should choose this volume if you want to splendour occasionally over some very interesting Hitchcock movie frames, `on the set' photographs and family album memorials, this is more of a film makers enlightenment than a Hitchcock tome for information. There are hundreds of photographs, black & white and colour, many covering a full 20cm x 25cm page, or even two of them. There are plenty of shots of Hitchcock in the middle of direction, standing by an actor or beside a camera, waving his arms about or pulling a face. It is interesting to see the early Hollywood sets and dollies, the kind used by Orson Wells to the new wave 70s helicopter rigs flying alongside the river Themes. It is not the kind of book that we are supposed to read from back to back, but is there for our amusement as a coffee table picture book and certainly a fine reference manual for any film making enthusiast. I highly recommend it to complement a Hitchcock DVD film collection. I often turn the pages to reference a film I have just watched to see some of the set design. It also covers some interesting topics like where and when Hitchcock appears in his movies with still-frames for orientation. The binding is high quality. There is tons of stuff on framing and lighting including the dynamics of camera elevation. Each image is something to be deeply considered. I can not see a film maker go wrong using these images as a director's template. It is a bit of imaging bible in that respect.
Frank Miller opens this absolutely must own graphic novel classic from 1987-88 by telling us that if the only Batman we remember was Adam West on Saturday mornings, then we do not know the Batman he once met, a much darker batman, a more real batman, the kind of Batman that Tim Burton would succeed somewhat in bringing to the screen in 1989, but Batman: Year One is just so much better in so many ways, and probably will remain better than any movie or television program you can expect to see or have seen. If you want to know Batman, then you should really be meeting him right here.<br /><br />I especially like the Batman: Year one story. It is an excellent beginning, lots of in-jokes and capturing moments, even on-the-edge of the seat suspense, almost 100 pages of intense artwork. It is about the beginning of Batman like you have never seen it before, but also and probably more importantly, includes the beginning of Commissioner Gordon, a Lieutenant Gordon here, with a pregnant wife, who comes to Gotham City and finds his whole department on the take. The millionaire Bruce Wayne, has been training to become a vigilante since his parents where murdered by a gang of thieves. It is a psychological condition of revenge. He is trying to find the right formula to scare his victims. When he does, he goes up against the same criminals and kingpins that Lieutenant Gordon finds himself up against, no Jokers or Penguins here, but regular underworld types making it all the more level-headed, and thus a more accepting Batman and story. Batman fails in first few attempts, but manages miraculously to survive and continue on, both Gordon and Batman building their careers as crime fighters in Gotham City throughout the pages, a surprise bonus Catwoman introduced in the final act which sees the new crime-fighting duo of Batman and Gordon finally meeting up, without any sign of Robin among the 96 pages, this is certainly an alternative Batman and probably the best one. Miller's look is a murky color bleeding hard edges and smears, resulting in a Batman graphic novel that takes your breath away. The action sequences are better than any movie I can think off to date, your eyes go wide open from frame to frame as this is the kind of animate Batman you have always wanted to see in action. It is not the kind of high quality artwork you see in advanced graphic novels, this was a series character that had to meet publication dates, but is still gloriously presented none the less. Just check out the sequence with Batman in the burning building fighting the SWAT team. It is the end of Chapter Two and most of Chapter 3. That is some of the best action sequences you have ever seen committed to the page.<br /><br />I would suggest that you also try and get \\"Batman: The Dark Night Returns\\" as that was the other Batman graphic novel and \\"Batman: The Dark Night Strikes Again\\", totally different types of art to Year One, as these are both Frank Miller's work, the sequels to Batman: Year One, are mostly other artists, DC comics has a list at the back, very interesting ones at that also, like Alan Moore's Batman: Killing Joke, but get all of Miller's Batman before you try any other Year One or Year Two books. I would also recommend that you actually try a BEST OF GRAPHIC NOVELS before you venture down any path. And for those who are hearing that they must read and see some graphic novels to get to know Batman, let me ask you this. Do you like to read? Do you like movies? Then why don't you try Graphic Novels? Comics you say? Don't say that. This stuff is art. Do you like to read? Then why not Graphic Novels? Do you like movies? Then why not Graphic Novels? Why not?

What happens when an agent runs a suspect's DNA through a database in connection with one crime and nails him on another unrelated crime? A modern Cold Hit. It is a flawed system, most cops refuse to give DNA into the system and random testing has not proved a success. `Cold Hits' is what it is all about. Next to the state hiring a famous alcohol prohibitionist - Elliot Ness, to hunt down a vicious serial killer in Cleveland 1930s , see the book \\"Torso by Steven Nickel\\" (great book though), \\"In Cold Blood\\" is the granddaddy of clown policing (more better crime books below).<br /><br />\\"In Cold Blood\\" often considered mandatory crime literature reading for its investigative reporting, now some odd thirty years later, still stands the test of a book's power to encapsulate the minds of all of those who read it, as there is no doubt that here is a highly motivated and laborious hand behind what comes across as a full `bloodied' work of art with an exceptional grasp of the English language and an ability to communicate almost telepathically every second of its journey, sadly, but not unexpectedly, can be disapproved in modern times - and rightly so. In synopses, \\"In Cold Blood\\" is a drama about a very real event involving farming family of four, the Clutters, who are tortured and shotgun downed in their home by two drifters, Hickock and Smith - Kansas Bureau of Investigation Agent Dewey assigned the case, sees if he can connect the `perfect crime' (the killers skipped states), there is no Mystery at all.<br /><br />\\"In Cold Blood\\" reads more like John Steinbeck's \\"Of Mice and Men\\", as fiction more than crime non-fiction, parts real - probably most not, there it is good but not great because it is very long. Seasoned crime non-fiction readers will find a problem early on in that too much is revealed by Capote in the first few pages, out of its over `paid-per-word' feel, would have served itself a lot better if the actual `crime' reporting element had not been biased, and flawed, it is apparent that its legal ramifications are many, the investigation reported on was horribly inept from the start, no critic offered by Capote as to where was the detecting? The exposure of the killers by sheer luck of an external witness who knew about it all, before the crime even happened, this is a cream and cherry dramatisation of a real world crime event that tastes quite bitter. It is okay to question why Truman Capote tries to make us identify with killers at that start, could it have been to turn the tables in conventional crime reporting, within the `mind' of the killers, treated as common as prison sod with deep sad histories but buckets of sympathy stupidity?  The breakdown of the criminals as they confess, their reasons found in childlike `dare' games and unfounded `anger bursts' that are never evident anywhere in the book's `story' everyone offering conjecture, Capote's concept of dedicated precision reporting, never starts, this is all absolutely tabloid newsworthy stuff that should not survive for more than a few seconds shelved in the `legal' section, this is \\"Capote's In Cold Blood\\" much more so than \\"The Murder of the Cutter Family\\".<br /><br />The aspersions of the writer to tell the crime story with nearly all characters fleshed fully by the first fifty pages changes structure and orientation to the point of the reader correctly suspecting it to be `too good'. Important KBI Agents that uncover evidence are given less page time than the other main player KBI agents who sat around doing nothing, visiting the crime scene over and over probably for donuts and coffee, pat themselves on the back after breaking the suspects and nodding in agreement about a possible `sympathetic' killer involvement, \\"and here he is!\\", circumstantial written all over it, I suspect Capote maybe a little naive, writing new invention on top of hindsight, so let us add more!, the admission is on the printed page, a cat out of the bag, the culprits caught themselves by stupidity in an era when Western policing was still very `Western', would we be offering conjecture like Capote does often when we say that the confessions where beaten from the suspects? I think probably not considering all things being under the microscope, Capote-style, fleshed out there is no whole picture, time and places are probably very good, but what really went on in the Clutter house or even `who' all characters really `are', that is certainly uncertain.<br /><br />Investigators even missed a footprint that was found at the scene of the crime, later in a photograph, a blow-up photograph, that was matched with a suspect's boot - this along with Capote even telling us that there where two other family murders almost exactly like the Holcolm Clutter Massacre, treated as `copycat' killings by the investigators and author, it is obvious to the reader that they where all probably related, but again here `all' would have to be connected to the killers and their `reasons' for killing, `their' story and this `story', things change, and they do often throughout the book's three hundred pages, the question is if the size is worthy of its Cold Hit fun, again in a world where Kansas officers slap backs when a stooge falls over onto his face, if Smith and Hickock did it (and they likely did) then it is not the two people described here and this is not the kind of thing you want you tax money spent on nowadays, try \\"Wicked Beyond Belief by Michael Bilton\\" (certainly a better investigative murder crime book) instead, see you next for \\"Killing for Company by Brain Masters\\" that could be better than this.emselves by stupidity in an era when Western policing was still very `Western', would we be offering conjecture like Capote does often when we say that the confessions where beaten from the suspects?

Frank Miller's \\"Batman: Year One\\" (1987 to 1988) was made after \\"Batman: The Dark Knight Returns\\" (1986) revamping the action element of Batman `graphic novels', adding importantly more darkness to the original Bob Kane concept, it is \\"Batman: Year One\\" that mostly resembles the NEW end of the 20th Century Batman, initiated Hollywood to Tim Burton's dark designs and Miller's \\"Year One\\" look, we have really \\"Batman: The Dark Knight Returns\\" to thank for starting it all, this is Miller's first incursion into Gotham City, decides that maybe he should bring along The Man of Steel and many other surprise characters, this graphic novel gets the tag as the best \\"Batman\\", fans would strongly agree, but \\"Year One\\" has a much better Gotham City, plus a purer Batman original concept, \\"The Dark Knight Returns\\" strikes some of the harshest, but consistently brilliant, artwork for a mainstream character, equally it is the concentration that went into the duality of the hero villain existence story and the psychology of a crime fighter, taking it from the angle that Batman is old and burnt out, means that \\"The Dark Knight Returns\\" is deeply intellectual stuff, at times gruelling so, seeing an old and frail Batman getting slugged in the stomach is not quite the same as Saturday Morning Adam West taking one for the team, especially if it is Superman pulling off the shots at splitting ribs.<br /><br />Miller surprises, Batman as vengeance incarnate decides to use guns, the President cracks down on vigilantes because of televised social statements treated as Oliver Stone would many years later with his media-blaming movie \\"Natural Born Killers\\", Superman murders Russian communists, the madness of our world evident in the Joker's ear to ear shin splitting grin, Robin could be a juvenile delinquent ready for a short stint in the slammer, the political correctness that has reduced Bruce Wayne to an elderly cripple, see him go on the urban takedown or be taken down.<br /><br />The four books here as a whole, span some 200 pages, received worldwide acclaim and made Frank Miller a household name, this is an extremely surprising worldly story with substance, the artwork slips between newspaper black and white `toon sketches to full-blown color pages with Batman leaping out of the sky, a big snarl across his face, \\"Batman: The Dark Knight Returns\\" is an honest example of how vast the superhero dilemma can be explored in our world today, doing the right thing versus the law, versus people so bored sitting around that they need to start a fight, Miller's \\"Batman: The Dark Knight Returns\\" battled for this darker style, \\"Year One\\" although different in nearly every department, carries the same tone, applied more to the Gotham structure and environment, \\"The Dark Knight Returns\\" is all about resolution to the `Batman problem' - a boy seeking revenge for the murder of his parents by murdering the `types' of characters that he perceives as taking his parent's lives - is the Joker really as bad as he seems, or does Batman make him so? Miller answers these questions categorically, \\"Batman: The Dark Knight Returns\\" offers parody page after page of it, the artwork's slaughtered style brought out by the mood, this is all the more reason why it is just so good.<br /><br />I would suggest that you also try and get \\"Batman: Year One\\" along with this. Year One will break you into Batman graphic novels in a week. This one takes a lot longer to read and absorb (had it going for a month). Read \\"Year One\\" before you choose \\"Batman: The Dark Night Strikes Again\\" (the Miller sequel to this book that you may or may not care to read). DC comics has a list at the back of \\"Year One\\", very interesting ones at that also, like Alan Moore's \\"Batman: Killing Joke\\", but get all of Miller's Batman before you try any other Batman Year One or Year Two books. I would also recommend that you actually try a BEST OF GRAPHIC NOVELS before you venture down any path - \\"Preacher #1: Gone to Texas\\", \\"Criminal Macabre\\", \\"Judge Dredd Featuring Judge Death\\" and some others found in the back pages of DC \\"Batman: Year One\\", I am sure you can find the best on your own.<br /><br />*The End of the book has an alternative Miller ending treatment that you can read.

Produced in 2003/2004 by Dark Horse Comics, the full color \\"Criminal Macabre\\", part of the Cal McDonald mystery series is already a classic collector's item for anyone interested in seeing the state of modern 21st century horror graphic novels. At 160 pages that makes it about the same size as a good \\"Preacher\\" graphic novel and is well worth checking out to see if a new horror series would interest you, besides the real reason to get \\"Criminal Macabre\\" in particular out of all the Cal McDonald series books by Steve Niles, is for Ben Templesmith's artwork, probably some of the most adventurous for any graphic novel you have ever seen, and certainly the most horror-apt as most are claiming, including a brief introduction by Rob Zombie, more fantastic than very detailed, mostly silver grey blurred backgrounds with realistic blood smears and rust, the characters made up of blurs and harsh edges, is lively, horrific, dashy and raw, however \\"Criminal Macabre\\" offers lots of funny breaks that tone down the violence, which is actually quite heavy, venturing sometimes into the obscene, not the scary kind, more fantasy vampire blow-up deaths like at the end of the movie \\"Blade\\", you will be hard pushed to be anything less than amazed at what you are seeing, the story is actually quite good when compared to movies like \\"Underworld\\", reality is you should be checking out this amazing storyboard instead.<br /><br />\\"Criminal Macabre\\" does something interesting for a graphic novel. It pits Vampires, Werewolves, Zombies and Mad Scientists against our hero detective cop, Cal McDonald, and his unofficial ghoul partner Mo'Lock, to get on the case of what appears to be new breeds of harder and bigger monsters trying to take over the city using the Ghoul's underground sewerage network as a means to raid specimens of the Plague from a dangerous virus research lab, so that they can create more monsters to rule the world, giving you everything that could hope for in a Monster Squad graphic novel like this one, except for total realism, if you are looking for that then sadly you should go elsewhere, the plot is not always incredible logical, as with the \\"Preacher\\" series at times, but we could crib about that if it wasn't for the exceptional artwork that blows any inconvenience anyway. Like I said, Max Payne meets Underworld.<br /><br />Steve Niles has other Cal McDonald detective graphic novels if you venture around. As of yet although there does not appear to be a sequel to this comic at this time of writing (even though #1 is on the side) there is obviously maybe a future Templesmith Niles Cal McDonald collaboration, however right now they are cooking up other themes to check out - \\"30 Days of Night\\" and \\"Dark Days\\". You can also get many other Steve Niles' Cal McDonald graphic novels by other artists, I may check out some of the other work there later, but I am more pushed to look at their other collaborations outside of Cal McDonald for the time being and certainly I would like to get hold of Steve Nile's \\"Remains\\", but my advise would be more inclined to offer you to collect the \\"Best of\\" graphic novels first (and this is one of them) before venturing further.<br /><br />Dark Horse also has some other interesting offerings that I might check out, but in the meantime Templesmith certainly makes this one a major piece of art that blows away most who view it. \\"Criminal Macabre\\" is a wonderful effort and a nice addition to the genre of hardcore horror /comedy graphic novels.

This happens to be a landmark entry in the Judge Dredd series, often reprinted as a newsagent quick money spinning comic; even here in the \\"2000AD Hardcover Collector's Editions\\", half of this black and white graphic novel is dedicated to the late seventies early eighties character of Judge Dredd, known best for his role in \\"2000 AD\\" graphic comic series, the biggest selling science-fiction comic in the UK, even though the concept is wholly American (John Wagner built Judge Dredd as an anti-commie future cop) brought to British readers a new character that is the longest surviving individual of the 2000 AD series, no one will even mention the movie of the same name (Dredd took off his helmet, duh!) in a room with fans because YOU WILL BE JUDGED!, here is Mega-City One, we get some of the best Judge Death stories, the classic JUDGE DREDD VS. JUDGE DEATH, including the three other death judges in the second story, this hardback cover collector's book is very large 11\\" x 9.4\\", but sadly Judge Death only takes up 50 pages, so the remaining 50 pages are filler 2000 AD comic strips with only Judge Dredd, but we do get more of Brian Bolland's artwork there and stories from John Howard but sadly there is no more Judge Death or John Wagner, but the point is that the original Judge Death series that boosted the character's appeal is right here. You can, by-all-means, probably pick up an actual comic of just the original Judge Death series, for a fraction of the price, but the hardback nature (and it is a lovely hardback) of this book means that this time your Judge Dredd vs Judge Death will keep.<br /><br />There is a color update of Judge Dredd vs. Judge Death but that is not this collector's version (the original) and instead you should be aiming for Judge Dredd: Necropolis Book One and Book Two (a two part series) or other recent color offerings, but then you are really going about looking for variations of the original theme that you get here, by all means do, but this is the original. On the basis of this book I probably would be weary about launching into getting the Collector's Series, unless I liked whatever 2000AD story and character is covered (I will be moving onto Judge Dredd: The Cursed Earth - 2000 AD Collector's Edition next), as they are old graphic novels (1980) and missing modern artwork and elements, none-the-less, the original Dredd vs. Death is right here the way I picked it up and later it fed the dog somehow... anyway this time I get to keep it.is the original.

This is not a bad Stephen King novel. The problem is that it does not really have any monsters per se, and is more about people and how their desire to \\"have\\" and \\"want\\" something can spell their doom. It is a good book by all means read it, but you just can't help feeling that by the end maybe reading something else better from King while watching \\"Wishmaster 2\\" should have been the way to go.
Not Anti-Drugs. 1977, Philip K. Dick nails his premise directly on the head sending shockwaves onwards thirty years later where the author now starts to make sense whereas before \\"A Scanner Darkly\\" and many of his other manuscripts where left to the B Movie circuit of back alley bookstores at best, it comes as no surprise to find this later-half Philip K. Dick popular novel just keeps getting better as the years role forward, Philip K. Dick, as we know, is vintage reading, becoming better with age... an age Philip K. Dick is predicting... an age that is already here... now. Bob Arctor is future Drug Enforcement Agency, uses his special scramble suit, a digital latex skin covering that can become anyone else, including Fred, a drug addict, who in actively perusing a new narcotic on the market called Substance D, for Death, lives as Bob in a Bachelor pad with two other drug addict friends, Barris and Luckman, along with a Substance D dealer chick, Donna, who he really digs, all as cover, possibly a target, for his real job, but begins to suspect that his disguise has been blown when things happening in his home lead him to suspect that someone knows he is not who he seems, and so by instructions of another DEA scramble suit employee called Hank, sets up Scanners all over the Bachelor pad in the hopes that he can view the holographic projections at a later date, becomes slowly embroidered in a mystery of worldly paranoia where the addict agent must find himself through the scanner's darkly before the clock runs out and he goes insane. `A Scanner Darkly' is very dark. At times what the characters are doing comes across as grossly disturbing, yet can be exceptionally human, but ultimately somewhat zeroed, the decentralization of power from the human being either by drug use or the government that rules them, tries to find that higher power, a better cause to fight, the collective mind is questioned relentlessly by Philip K. Dick who here goes for the jugular with questions such as, if I stand on a chair I can not bite my forehead, but can I use the mind to see the mind? Deals not with the brain or the drugs that can fuel it, but the spirit behind the veil that is using this stuff as art to feed the soul, and what happens to that soul when it does not get its art? Philip K. Dick paints Substance Death as a Substance Darkly, yet the book is wholly devoted to exposing the crime of prohibition, Arctor as the agent is in both states the hero and a victim, as agent and drug addict, Philip K. Dick ends the book with a two page article about friends of his who have died from drug misuse, a letter from October 2nd 1972 to Orange Country DEA shows that Philip K. Dick actively sought and pushed for drug education, this however is not the point, 221 pages in 1977 are devoted entirely to the problem of `prohibition' itself, the fractured psyche of the `straight' who is horrified that a horror film would role before their eyes for ever and ever, to the cracked psyche of the drug user, to the splintered psyche of the drug enforcement agent, Philip K. Dick recognizes the need for restraint, describes legal failure and pushes for education and reform, yet tells users to beware, especially those who use inorganic drug substances, McDonalds Food, Coke, Heroin, Cocaine, Alcohol... anything that does not occur naturally in nature and calls itself a drug, with organic drugs that come as herbs maybe safer to use if we do choose to experiment, exploits this final vestibule of assertion by directly evoking the Iron Law of Prohibition, that making something illegal only makes the substance a hell of a lot more dangerous and creates a horrible drug war system, \\"that poor man\\" is what we are left thinking in the end except for the notion that maybe the next Thanksgiving will see it all go back to square one again, this is a great book about reform in all things but with consequences for the frankly, `stupid'.<br /><br />`A Scanner Darkly' can draw many parallels with books like `1984', `Brave New World', `Fahrenheit 451' and `Slaughterhouse 5, as we catch but a fleeting glimpse of love in a world of `thought police' and mind control `A Scanner Darkly' chooses its subject more accurately, the pathology of the drug war system, this is a piece of work that must be read by anyone who likes science-fiction, mandatory reading for anyone in the least bit interested in drug war politics or political science. Orion SF Masterworks series rates this as #20 in its list, but I believe that is because there is hardly any science-fiction in it, Philip K.

What a great introduction to the idea that an old man has got the 'gift' and can see people who are loosing their souls...<br /><br />... just goes banal just more than half way through to the point where you need to be a Dark Tower fan, big time, to like it. If you read Black House and liked that (because you are a Dark Tower series fan, and you read The Talisman) then Insominia has all that some other-worldy stuff that isn't really every King fan's cup of tea.
You must by all account at least try and read this \\"fairy tale\\" from King because it is a full size page turner King-style. The best bit is King describing the King vomit into his royal fireplace. It has everything, damsel in distress, Brad Pitt type hero, we are all surprised no one has made it into a movie yet because it is very good. King did not do fantasy before this and I think this is his best Fantasy book next to The Dark Tower. Certainly Dark Tower readers should try here. I would also recommend it to those who like The Stand as there is a character from that book here. So in many ways there is lots of reasons to try this out. Pure \\"Fairy Tale\\" horror in every sense of the word. It is like King has hijacked the Brother's Grimm for a weekend.
Slaughterhouse 5, or Slaughterhouse five, or The Children's Crusade, also called A Duty-Dance with Death, is described by the author Kurt Vonnegut's alter-ego, Billy Pilgrim as a `fourth-generation German-American now living in easy circumstances on Cape Cod [and smoking too much], who, as an American Infantry Scout Hors De Combat, As a prisoner of war, witnessed the fire-bombing of Dresden, Germany, \\"The Florence of the Elbe,\\" a long time ago, and survived to tell the tell. This is a novel somewhat in the telegraphic schizophrenic manner of tales of the planet Tralfamadore, where the flying saucers come from. Peace.' So it goes.<br /><br />The book is an anti-war book, but tells us that it is about as useful being an anti-war book, as being an anti-typhoon book, meaning that some things will never change. Vonnegut tells us this by giving us the story of Billy Pilgrim, whose most important role in life was to witness the secret American British bombing of Dresden, where 135,000 died, and who spent most of his time as an American Prisoner of War, a survivor who can tell the youth of today what war is all about, by using his shellshock trauma induced time travel capabilities, given to him by the Tralfamadore aliens, to revisit the war, so that he can write a book about it, goes to see old war buddies, becoming unstuck in time, his life as a series of scenes in a non-linear fashion which ends up making linear sense, even though it did not at the time. So it goes.<br /><br />Slaughterhouse 5 is a very interesting and somewhat touching series of events that finally all come home to roost in the final pages, the loss of man is the gain of man, whether we like it or not, is not the point, Darwin told us that this is what we are designed to do, Billy Pilgrim becomes an optometrist in the process, marries a woman who suddenly has a series problem, while Bill ends up in a zoo on an alien planet to produce children with Montana Wildhack, a famous movie actress, while trying to write his Dresdon story, filled with death, a plane accident where he was the only survivor following his POW term, fact from fiction, he thinks the rescue party are nazis, it sets off the time travel again. So it goes.<br /><br />Vonnegut is not all down and war depressing however. His humour captured brilliantly by such antics as considering the money tree that grew hundred dollar bills, gems and bank bonds, feeding off the people who met the quicksand by its base, or a young Jesus who once built a cross with his father so the Romans could use it to do something to a protestor that they didn't like. When the wit is there it scores in aces. You have never read the likes of such clowning around before, although compared to Joseph Heller's Catch 22, this one is more personal, less satirical, more direct and exposes that horrible World War II bombing of Dresden. In 1941 Charles Portal, A British Air Staff officer, put forward the idea that entire cities and towns should be bombed. Air Marshall Arthur Harris agreed in February 1942. It was napalmed in 1945. Vonnegut made it very public in this 1969 novel. It was revealed by the historian David Irving in 1963 in his publication, \\"The Destruction of Dresdon\\". So it goes.<br /><br />Billy spends the final days of his life out across New York looking to tell a radio show his story, ends up finding a world war II sci-fi book author's book as window dressing, attempts to buy the book as a memory keepsake because he met the author and knew the war buddy who introduced him to the books, and is nearly arrested, and or committed, old age coupled with the dying man's last bastion of whatever his mind can make of it all, gives us much to ponder in death, by remembering our lives, Pilgrim travels in his memory and says that death is living ones memories over and over again... so best be good... and enjoy life.

The book's title is somewhat misleading us into believing that the 1930s `The Untouchables' character of Elliot Ness ran a serial killer investigation. Half this book is the life and times of Ness who happened to be Director of Public Safety in Cleveland while his skid row turned up mostly unidentifiable dismembered remains of vagrants, it was Ness who gained the most attention throughout the investigation by eventually burning down the homeless slums of the Kingsbury Run district in an attempt to clean out, tag, and fingerprint potential victims in the making, probably destroying the killer's Cleveland homeless hunting grounds, also a turning point event in Ness's career, a prohibitionist alcohol distillery buster, who once put away the national crime lord Al Capone, sadly failed systematically to progress his ratings with the city, eventually becoming involved in a hit and run accident that cost him an election run as Mayor, the over-hyped but none-the-less interesting account of Ness is all here, but maybe a little bit more than a seasoned non-crime fiction reader would care to expect, means you get only about 100 pages of the Torso investigation, where we concentrate on the city coroner Dr. Samuel Gerber and Detective Peter Merylo.<br /><br />Ness comes into play now and again, obviously as a propaganda figurehead designed to play to the media, backfires most of the time he does appear by getting involved in the wrong thing at the wrong time, still had a very high success rate in exposing corruption, and did work on a number of highly constructive policies like getting kids off the streets and stressing the fight against disease, obviously behind the scenes worked with the \\"\\"good guy\\"\\" force heavies getting all the important political prohibition work done (alcohol prohibition was a failure not because alcohol is safe to use but because prohibition itself actually increases the prohibited drugs risks, usage rates and overall crime goes up because of it, a statistical fact). It is reading the situation of these same propaganda violent cops becoming cold case serial killer squads, even before the term serial killer was used, makes it an absurd situation of bad police management for the 21st century reader to contend with, and was the reason Ness went bust in the end and even more importantly, why the killer got away with so much in the first place.<br /><br />Thus the investigation in Torso is not like any other, the cops are a different breed (just like out of a comic book meaning useless in real life) and the concept of `stranger killing' was not even present then. The classic book \\"The Complete History of Jack the Ripper by Philip Sugden\\" is based on the police records at Scotland Yard of the investigation at the end of the 19th century, news paper clippings and various memorandums that followed with surprising valid detail (all 500 pages of it). Torso reads like trying to find anything factual as if anyone except the leads could read, write or file reports, pounded and smashed their way across Cleveland in the hopes of stumbling across a sexual sadist who would suddenly admit to picking up homeless people, decapitating them with a large blade while they where asleep and or tying them up beforehand so they could not escape, a paraphiliac, expertly removed all the appendages after death with `knowledge of surgery' and bisected the body, sometimes used chemicals or freezers to keep his victims, would then wrap the pieces and begin his very strange dumping process which ranged from never-found victims, to victim's body parts appearing in the middle of the city for everyone to see, going to great lengths to leave two incomplete victims from different time periods together in the same spot, it stands to reason that Dr. Samuel Gerber and Detective Peter Merylo would give us a much better angle, and it is with the medical evidence that Gerber comes off as a sort of new-wave criminology serial killer expert, knowingly prevented other coroners from going near the victim's body parts, rightly asserts himself as a scientist in among all the investigative despair, leading some to suspect and challenge Gerber himself, after his conclusions that a recent severed leg was the work of the same hand, this statement exonerated various numbers of peoples who where obviously rotting in jail on suspicion of being the killer.<br /><br />Merylo correctly guessed that the killer was somewhat mobile in the area and probably moved on after the killings that did not stop at #12, Merylo at the end of his career guessed that it was probably above forty. Dr. Francis E. Sweeney is the mystery Ness suspect not named in this book but the evidence is circumstantial at best. Gerber may have given the investigators a better idea of who there man was if he did not also subscribe himself to propaganda theories (druggie maniac). It is almost a certainty that if the investigators conducted better searches of abandoned train carts that they would have discovered the killer's `laboratory', a series of abandoned carts containing three different bodies that came from Youngstown after being there for almost a year, was almost certainly that unacknowledged lab of his, but Gerber did not examine these bodies. From the victims that could be identified all where prostitutes or homosexuals. The killer probably killed them away from his home, suggesting that he lived homelessly or with a family, certainly hung around the lower classes of society, befriended vagrants and some other loiterers who where happy enough to sleep with him in train carts (if this fact you are reading now had have been known at the start it would have probably prevented more death), resided in the general area and probably killed and mutilated several times before the first official Torso was found, meaning he learned his `surgical skill' that way.<br /><br />He should have been caught earlier. Torso is a shallow account of the subject matter but still essential non-fiction crime literature.ed other coroners from going near the victim's body parts, rightly asserts himself as a scientist in among all the investigative despair, leading some to suspect and challenge Gerber himself, after his conclusions that a recent severed leg was the work of the same hand, this statement exonerated various numbers of peoples who where obviously rotting in jail on suspicion of being the killer. <br /> <br />Merylo correctly guessed that the killer was somewhat mobile in the area and probably moved on after the killings that did not stop at #12, Merylo at the end of his career guessed that it was probably above forty.

Misery is a peak in King's ability to write amazing thrillers, much like The Dead Zone, there is not a lot of horror here, going for the psychological frights, scores in aces with this #1 fan gone on the rampage via the form of Anne the wrestling nurse who drugs up the missing writer Paul Sheldon after finding him a car crash, very few characters, mostly just the two, suspend this book till the final shell-shocked writer flashback syndrome, Misery just shows how crazy good King is at his craft. It is also one of the better movie remakes from the same director who filmed the other good one - Stand By Me. Read it!
Put it in the grown up section and parents will think you have gone crazy. Put it in the kids section and suddenly you have parents complaining that it made their kids grow up too quickly. THIS IS THE PERFECT NOVEL FOR TEENS LOOKING FOR SEMI-ADULT CRIME FICTION BOOKS AND THUS THE PERFECT NOVEL FOR ADULTS LOOKING TO REMEMBER THE GOOD OLD DAYS! Essentially it is about a boy who manages to get in on his older brother's detective job and takes on a case for himself. It is really a book for 12 year olds and over because there is a little bit of crime violence in the book like the bad guy death ending, but it has all the pace of a movie like The Mummy. It is shame they do not make more kid's crime movies as Horowitz demonstates it is an incredably popular genre (he is read cover to cover in the UK) and with that said and done, this is a great book to try in The Diamond Brothers Trilogy). Do try it!
Cujo was a book I read... or went through... quick quickly. Even Stephen King says that he can forgive you for not reading every word because he does not remember writing much with it, because according to his current autobiography \\"On Writing\\" he says this was the one that was mostly a part of his cocaine addiction.<br /><br />It is, for all essential purposes, a nice dog turned crazy running around a woman locked in her car. It is quite well described although you would have to imagine why some of his better short stories did not make it to this length.

To treat it as just 'horror' would only do this coming-of-age-telekenetic-girl-having-her-period-for-nearly-300-pages, an injustice, because it is also an original modern All-american high school tale that is the solid writing undercurrent that carries the high concept pitch that floats on it, this his first novel saved from the bin by his wife who said 'hey, this ain't bad' while they lived in a trailer home, got King his first six digit check, the idea can be summed up the image of huge full size jesus swaying inside the neighbour's trailer living room with the daughter always kneeling down before it, King blatantly lived by the die hard writing tip #1 of -- write what you know... and that is why Carrie is so whacked out.
... but have you also seen the movie with Christopher Walken and Martin Sheen, directed by David Cronenberg? Well I think the movie is probably just as good, if not maybe a tad better, but that is because it just works so well on the big screen and is one of the better Stephen King movies out there, although it is a little dated, great none the less. The premise of the Dead Zone is a smashing one about the power of second sight, a man wakes up from a coma and starts to see glimpses of the future where it becomes a two-fold story, the first is a hunt for a serial killer, the second is a looming crisis to do with the President. Amazing stuff right up until the shocking climax, read this and then watch the film, it is not exactly horror, more a top notch King THRILLER.
Frank Miller opens this absolutely must own graphic novel classic from 1987-88 by telling us that if the only Batman we remember was Adam West on Saturday mornings, then we do not know the Batman he once met, a much darker batman, a more real batman, the kind of Batman that Tim Burton would succeed somewhat in bringing to the screen in 1989, but Batman: Year One is just so much better in so many ways, and probably will remain better than any movie or television program you can expect to see or have seen. If you want to know Batman, then you should really be meeting him right here.<br /><br />I especially like the Batman: Year one story. It is an excellent beginning, lots of in-jokes and capturing moments, even on-the-edge of the seat suspense, almost 100 pages of intense artwork. It is about the beginning of Batman like you have never seen it before, but also and probably more importantly, includes the beginning of Commissioner Gordon, a Lieutenant Gordon here, with a pregnant wife, who comes to Gotham City and finds his whole department on the take. The millionaire Bruce Wayne, has been training to become a vigilante since his parents where murdered by a gang of thieves. It is a psychological condition of revenge. He is trying to find the right formula to scare his victims. When he does, he goes up against the same criminals and kingpins that Lieutenant Gordon finds himself up against, no Jokers or Penguins here, but regular underworld types making it all the more level-headed, and thus a more accepting Batman and story. Batman fails in first few attempts, but manages miraculously to survive and continue on, both Gordon and Batman building their careers as crime fighters in Gotham City throughout the pages, a surprise bonus Catwoman introduced in the final act which sees the new crime-fighting duo of Batman and Gordon finally meeting up, without any sign of Robin among the 96 pages, this is certainly an alternative Batman and probably the best one. Miller's look is a murky color bleeding hard edges and smears, resulting in a Batman graphic novel that takes your breath away. The action sequences are better than any movie I can think off to date, your eyes go wide open from frame to frame as this is the kind of animate Batman you have always wanted to see in action. It is not the kind of high quality artwork you see in advanced graphic novels, this was a series character that had to meet publication dates, but is still gloriously presented none the less. Just check out the sequence with Batman in the burning building fighting the SWAT team. It is the end of Chapter Two and most of Chapter 3. That is some of the best action sequences you have ever seen committed to the page.<br /><br />I would suggest that you also try and get \\"Batman: The Dark Night Returns\\" as that was the other Batman graphic novel and \\"Batman: The Dark Night Strikes Again\\", totally different types of art to Year One, as these are both Frank Miller's work, the sequels to Batman: Year One, are mostly other artists, DC comics has a list at the back, very interesting ones at that also, like Alan Moore's Batman: Killing Joke, but get all of Miller's Batman before you try any other Year One or Year Two books. I would also recommend that you actually try a BEST OF GRAPHIC NOVELS before you venture down any path. And for those who are hearing that they must read and see some graphic novels to get to know Batman, let me ask you this. Do you like to read? Do you like movies? Then why don't you try Graphic Novels? Comics you say? Don't say that. This stuff is art. Do you like to read? Then why not Graphic Novels? Do you like movies? Then why not Graphic Novels? Why not?

Slaughterhouse 5, or Slaughterhouse five, or The Children's Crusade, also called A Duty-Dance with Death, is described by the author Kurt Vonnegut's alter-ego, Billy Pilgrim as a `fourth-generation German-American now living in easy circumstances on Cape Cod [and smoking too much], who, as an American Infantry Scout Hors De Combat, As a prisoner of war, witnessed the fire-bombing of Dresden, Germany, \\"The Florence of the Elbe,\\" a long time ago, and survived to tell the tell. This is a novel somewhat in the telegraphic schizophrenic manner of tales of the planet Tralfamadore, where the flying saucers come from. Peace.' So it goes.<br /><br />The book is an anti-war book, but tells us that it is about as useful being an anti-war book, as being an anti-typhoon book, meaning that some things will never change. Vonnegut tells us this by giving us the story of Billy Pilgrim, whose most important role in life was to witness the secret American British bombing of Dresden, where 135,000 died, and who spent most of his time as an American Prisoner of War, a survivor who can tell the youth of today what war is all about, by using his shellshock trauma induced time travel capabilities, given to him by the Tralfamadore aliens, to revisit the war, so that he can write a book about it, goes to see old war buddies, becoming unstuck in time, his life as a series of scenes in a non-linear fashion which ends up making linear sense, even though it did not at the time. So it goes.<br /><br />Slaughterhouse 5 is a very interesting and somewhat touching series of events that finally all come home to roost in the final pages, the loss of man is the gain of man, whether we like it or not, is not the point, Darwin told us that this is what we are designed to do, Billy Pilgrim becomes an optometrist in the process, marries a woman who suddenly has a series problem, while Bill ends up in a zoo on an alien planet to produce children with Montana Wildhack, a famous movie actress, while trying to write his Dresdon story, filled with death, a plane accident where he was the only survivor following his POW term, fact from fiction, he thinks the rescue party are nazis, it sets off the time travel again. So it goes.<br /><br />Vonnegut is not all down and war depressing however. His humour captured brilliantly by such antics as considering the money tree that grew hundred dollar bills, gems and bank bonds, feeding off the people who met the quicksand by its base, or a young Jesus who once built a cross with his father so the Romans could use it to do something to a protestor that they didn't like. When the wit is there it scores in aces. You have never read the likes of such clowning around before, although compared to Joseph Heller's Catch 22, this one is more personal, less satirical, more direct and exposes that horrible World War II bombing of Dresden. In 1941 Charles Portal, A British Air Staff officer, put forward the idea that entire cities and towns should be bombed. Air Marshall Arthur Harris agreed in February 1942. It was napalmed in 1945. Vonnegut made it very public in this 1969 novel. It was revealed by the historian David Irving in 1963 in his publication, \\"The Destruction of Dresdon\\". So it goes.<br /><br />Billy spends the final days of his life out across New York looking to tell a radio show his story, ends up finding a world war II sci-fi book author's book as window dressing, attempts to buy the book as a memory keepsake because he met the author and knew the war buddy who introduced him to the books, and is nearly arrested, and or committed, old age coupled with the dying man's last bastion of whatever his mind can make of it all, gives us much to ponder in death, by remembering our lives, Pilgrim travels in his memory and says that death is living ones memories over and over again... so best be good... and enjoy life.

Also known as \\"The Cinematographers Bible\\", this thick hand-sized pocket book is an absolute must for anybody who owns or uses a 16mm, Super 16mm, 35mm, Super 35mm or 70mm motion picture camera (movie cameras). IT WILL NOT TEACH YOU CINEMATOGRAPHY! It is a technical manual to be used when shooting on film and has since become the industry standard book that most amateur and professional cinematographers own and use. Motion pictures cameras are also built around the specifications laid down in this book.<br /><br />Essentially the first 100 pages deal with all the different types of motion picture cameras, their internal mechanisms, technical details and threading paths. Then the book goes on to dealing with motion picture film itself, the various brands that are available, differences between black and white, color and a bit about the development process of each one. Again, technically detailed. There is also very valuable charts on film lengths and running times according to fps. The lens section is very technical covering the different types of lenses and the most important focal length, distance to subject, measuring charts that is really the most widely used part of this book. There is a massive section on filters, exposure and emulsion testing.<br /><br />The book then deals with lighting and covers the various aspects of lighting types, bulbs, filters and exposure techniques, all highly technical in nature with references to charts and illustrations. The book ends with a coverage of visual special effects that can be done with the motion picture camera and other special techniques that the cinematographer will need to know about.<br /><br />You will need this book if you are shooting on film, end of story. If you are looking for a manual that teaches cinematography then choose CINEMATOGRAPHY by Kris Malkiewicz instead. As a note, there is a lot of new digital cinematography cameras on the up and coming that work on digital video tape and not film and many new filmmakers may be advised to check out this route as a cheaper and less costly way of shooting their first film.y new filmmakers may be advised to check out this route as a cheaper and less costly way of shooting their first film.

Basically this book is a three part book. The start of the book goes into the film making process, what it is about, why bother and how to get started. It gives you a general air of what is going on before a film starts shooting.<br /><br />The middle part of the book is extremely technically useful. Don't be put-off by the fact that it is a British book, most of the standards are the same and the writer covers both US systems and UK systems. Anyway the value of this book is in that the writer interviews very important people that work in the filming process - actors, special effects, film lab, cameramen, editors, sound editors, legal agencies, projectionists, marketing people, producers, directors... etc.... and they all give very profesional tips on what you should do and what you should NOT do.<br /><br />The third part of the book deals with CASE STUDIES and various filmmakers talk about their projects and what went right and what went wrong.<br /><br />Overall this is a very good book with lots of information from the people that matter in this industry. There is a lot of information on what NOT to do when shooting your first film. Anybody who wants to get into to film making should not miss out on this writer/director's account of his experiences with film making.

Do you like to read? Do you like movies? Then why don't you try Graphic Novels? Comics you say? Don't say that. This stuff is art. Do you like to read? Then why not Graphic Novels? Do you like movies? Then why not Graphic Novels? Why not? Why? Because it can be... \\"More fun than going to the movies\\" - Kevin Smith, Director Clerks.<br /><br />Book #1 must be checked out. It is a DC comic's publication. The title - \\"Preacher: Gone to Texas\\", is a two story book introducing us to three core characters, Jesse Custer, a minister who has been zapped with the pseudo power of god by a fallen angel that drops down on his congregation during a meeting, finds himself after in a bar with Tulip, a road bandit and also Jesse's ex-lover, along with an Irish vampire, Cassidy, who has hitched in on the ride, the trio find themselves up against Sheriff Root, the law in Texas, with a demon on their tail who has been unleashed from heaven to track down the escaped pseudo power of God. This story is quite action packed, very funny fowl language and has a sense of humour, although don't expect it to be a very deep character analysis (you will have to fill in much of the gaps for yourself) although the second half of the book about a serial killer at large does not quite capture the ferocity of the first episode, is none the less a very interesting segment that is sort of telling you that the Preacher series can, and probably will go absolutely everywhere and anywhere, and as someone who has yet to read any more in the series I must say that I would get Volume 2 just on the bases of what I have enjoyed here.<br /><br />Preacher: Gone to Texas is an amazing piece of art to own. It can proudly sit along side any classic volume of literature or sit beside the Mona Lisa. Draw your attention to the cover, Glen Fabry, offers 10 other graphic plates in the book that are almost worth buying another copy for, just to tear out those pictures and put them in a frame, the guiding light for any future budding graphic novel animators, those images are sublime and worth the cost of the book alone.<br /><br />Even though Fabry is replaced by the core artists, Garth Ennis and Steve Dillion do an amazing job of the layout, meaning do not turn pages in this graphic novel, as some pages are surprises designed to grab you... and they do, so at least allow yourself to be stunned by not looking ahead, okay. That is a general good rule for the Preacher graphic novel anyway... others like Johnny The Homicidal Maniac: The Director's Cut you could spend days jumping back and across through but these ARTY graphic novels tend to have less plates and more high impact artwork, sometimes covering whole pages, meaning that it is easy to spoil Preacher with just glancing through it once.<br /><br />I found Preacher to be one of the most engaging Graphic Novels I have seen. It really does bring the next frame or page along at a shocking pace with many scenes leaping out at you and grabbing you buy the throat, WOW! to go along with the illustrated POW! See you at Preacher #2 for a review if you enjoyed the first episode like I did.ture budding graphic novel animators, those images are sublime and worth the cost of the book alone. <br /> <br />Even though Fabry is replaced by the core artists, Garth Ennis and Steve Dillion do an amazing job of the layout, meaning do not turn pages in this graphic novel, as some pages are surprises designed to grab you... and they do, so at least allow yourself to be stunned by not looking ahead, okay.

A charged high concept with added change, Pet Semetary is a must read from King, a true 20th century horror story delivering on the same moral dilemmas that are faced by characters written into 19th century horror literature, a classic tour-de-force notion, here King takes a doctor through journey of ancient animal burial grounds, resurrection of dead pets and what happens to the good doctor when the local highway wins a member of his family.<br /><br />That is the synopsis. No more needs to be said or done because King does it better within these pages.

Okay, say the name on the tip of your tongue - The Diary of Jack the Ripper - and watch as the dollar signs flicker before your eyes. It was bound to happen sooner or later. The reason why the Diary is still popular today is because a few Ripperologists attached their name to it and few have had the guts to actually say that they where wrong and walk away from it. The Diary is essentially a mini-volume of notes allegedly written by James Maybrick, around the time of the Whitechapel murders, that sign at the end as \\"Jack the Ripper\\". So how does it read? Well it is reasonably fair to say that it is very creative reading and does keep you entertained, but then again that is exactly what it is meant to do.

... these words will be here to warn you. This book has had millions of reprints. It gets a new title every year just so that all the 1 star reviews vanish over for a new term.<br /><br />The hoaxer admitted forging the diary.<br /><br />Okay, say the name on the tip of your tongue - The Diary of Jack the Ripper - and watch as the dollar signs flicker before your eyes. It was bound to happen sooner or later. The reason why the Diary is still popular today is because a few Ripperologists attached their name to it and few have had the guts to actually say that they where wrong and walk away from it. The Diary is essentially a mini-volume of notes allegedly written by James Maybrick, around the time of the Whitechapel murders, that sign at the end as \\"Jack the Ripper\\". So how does it read? Well it is reasonably fair to say that it is very creative reading and does keep you entertained, but then again that is exactly what it is meant to do. What we know today is that it is undoubtedly a forgery because the owner of the book Michael Barrett simply admitted to forging it himself. End of story, really.

Firestarter is a very inside book from King, with lots of descriptions and very interesting set pieces, from the LSD college experiments with people ripping themselves to shreds to the father of the girl who is now born with special fire starting powers and the government psycho who is trying to capture her, Firestarter has more pace than most King books and is actually more of an action/horror read with some very good descriptions of the thought process. Better than you might expect, this is yet another classic from King during his early days... the best era from him.
Slaughterhouse 5, or Slaughterhouse five, or The Children's Crusade, also called A Duty-Dance with Death, is described by the author Kurt Vonnegut's alter-ego, Billy Pilgrim as a `fourth-generation German-American now living in easy circumstances on Cape Cod [and smoking too much], who, as an American Infantry Scout Hors De Combat, As a prisoner of war, witnessed the fire-bombing of Dresden, Germany, \\"The Florence of the Elbe,\\" a long time ago, and survived to tell the tell. This is a novel somewhat in the telegraphic schizophrenic manner of tales of the planet Tralfamadore, where the flying saucers come from. Peace.' So it goes.<br /><br />The book is an anti-war book, but tells us that it is about as useful being an anti-war book, as being an anti-typhoon book, meaning that some things will never change. Vonnegut tells us this by giving us the story of Billy Pilgrim, whose most important role in life was to witness the secret American British bombing of Dresden, where 135,000 died, and who spent most of his time as an American Prisoner of War, a survivor who can tell the youth of today what war is all about, by using his shellshock trauma induced time travel capabilities, given to him by the Tralfamadore aliens, to revisit the war, so that he can write a book about it, goes to see old war buddies, becoming unstuck in time, his life as a series of scenes in a non-linear fashion which ends up making linear sense, even though it did not at the time. So it goes.<br /><br />Slaughterhouse 5 is a very interesting and somewhat touching series of events that finally all come home to roost in the final pages, the loss of man is the gain of man, whether we like it or not, is not the point, Darwin told us that this is what we are designed to do, Billy Pilgrim becomes an optometrist in the process, marries a woman who suddenly has a series problem, while Bill ends up in a zoo on an alien planet to produce children with Montana Wildhack, a famous movie actress, while trying to write his Dresdon story, filled with death, a plane accident where he was the only survivor following his POW term, fact from fiction, he thinks the rescue party are nazis, it sets off the time travel again. So it goes.<br /><br />Vonnegut is not all down and war depressing however. His humour captured brilliantly by such antics as considering the money tree that grew hundred dollar bills, gems and bank bonds, feeding off the people who met the quicksand by its base, or a young Jesus who once built a cross with his father so the Romans could use it to do something to a protestor that they didn't like. When the wit is there it scores in aces. You have never read the likes of such clowning around before, although compared to Joseph Heller's Catch 22, this one is more personal, less satirical, more direct and exposes that horrible World War II bombing of Dresden. In 1941 Charles Portal, A British Air Staff officer, put forward the idea that entire cities and towns should be bombed. Air Marshall Arthur Harris agreed in February 1942. It was napalmed in 1945. Vonnegut made it very public in this 1969 novel. It was revealed by the historian David Irving in 1963 in his publication, \\"The Destruction of Dresdon\\".

I did not like this one in the least as it deals with a group of people who murder in a role-playing game they create over the internet and ends up coming off like a very bad Italian splatter movie complete with a banal plot, obviously no concept of internet security and wire tracing, cornflakes box characters and nothing of the kind of intelligence or pace that went into other Alex Cross books. Also the Cross backstory takes horrible turns becoming something like the Brady Bunch. Get the originals or a sequel like Cast & Mouse rather than this failure concept. Patterson totally lost it with this one.
The problem I have with The Shining... is The Shining... the gift of second sight, is never really dealt with that well in the book except how it ends up sending someone mad. The horror is much better in the book though than the film and the story is different in many parts, most importantly the animal hedge rows, and some other plot elements. A haunted hotel is the main theme, combined with a family that has the gift, but to be honest King rips the ending from the original Axeman dad gone wild on the family story, by Jay Anson, who wrote The Amityville Horror before this book. The two books so similar that it is hard to imagine that King did not know where his influence was directly coming from. It happens, The Shining, not as original as it tries to be, is really only a very average shabby king novel that would rate next to Cujo as one of his older works to pass on by.<br /><br />For some reason Kubrick tried to pass off a very long and boring remake of this tale that seems to make people think that the original book is a somewhat classic in King's collection. It is only a very average King book and not all it is made out to be as some others have wisely noted.
If you remembered watching the series when it first came out and if you read this book at the same time, then it was during an era when Stephen King was becoming a very big household name, Salem's Lot probably being the icing on that cake, and a very important instalment in the series, and probably the book that sealed King's fate as a horror writer. He could have turned anywhere after Carrie and instead delivered on a story about a town with a local vampire problem.<br /><br />(Jeru)salem's Lot is a Timeless Horror classic. This is one of King's best ever page turners, each page demanding that you read the next... a perfectly executed piece of literature moving between first rate soap opera, B movie horror, faultless character development, great arcs and an unbelievable ending to boot, horrific right up until the finale midnight coffin hunting in the old house on the hill. Oh, holy hell!<br /><br />A masterpiece that can not be described in a full bodied review, this is certainly one of King's best works he has ever written. The hero is even a writer. You don't have to like vampires to like the thought of writers chasing vampires in their old boyhood town.
Next to reading \\"The Man in the High Castle\\", I was prepared to read something as deep and as drawn out as that Hugo winning quasi-science-fiction novel from the same author. \\"Martian Time-Slip\\" is described as being similar in nature to that style of writing. I also discovered \\"Clans of the Alphane Moon\\", \\"Do Androids Dream of Electric Sheep\\" (Blade Runner), \\"Ubik\\" and \\"The Simulacra\\", all of which are 5 star reads, \\"Martian-Time Slip\\" comes highly recommended because it is in the top twenty science-fiction books, Orion Publishers and the SF Masterworks series listing it as #13 in their collection. Unfortunately I was surprised by how little I enjoyed any of it and in fact I hated a lot of it, however the author should be credited and published for creating this world, but as for reading it... well that is a totally different matter. This is an oddity, more for collectors than readers. I am glad to have it in my Philip K. Dick collection.... However, it is at the back of his collection.<br /><br />Mars is populated by settlers from Earth, starting a new world there, with Bleekmen Martians, like primitive man, selling trinkets to earthlings, who mostly need clean water, which is owned by the waterworks manager, Arnie Kott, who has acquired a former mentally ill repairman, Jack Bohlen, to plug into the mind of an autistic boy, Manfred, who might be able to see the future and tell him why the UN wants to buy in on Mars soil. Jack's father arrives from Earth, turns out to be a prospector and Jack ends up double-crossing Kott, over and over again in alterative universes, until he figures what is going on and by that stage you just don't care because there is no ending, there is no science-fiction, the politics and extraterrestrial real estate scams became moot long ago, the penetration of the mysteries of being and time totally abstract to the point of meaninglessness anywhere else except in Dick's mind, then we get his over-excuse for adultery neatly wrapped in a package \\"Sleep with other people so that you get to know what your spouse is doing right and wrong\\", Dick who happens to have been married five times, really doesn't come across as that faithful to his characters and his alter-ego chews through them, mostly sexually, and quite disturbingly, ending up in a Dick book that doesn't quite have the same panache as anything I have read from him before.<br /><br />Even though \\"Martian Time-Slip\\" puts forward some very interesting notions that make you think ah, here it comes, the plot or the twist, it never really does. Instead you end up with an extended soap opera on Mars, not that this is a bad idea, Dick writes good soap into his science-fiction (\\"Clans of the Alphane Moon\\" does it well), but the soap here pretty much envelops any science-fiction under all the smut and suds that come out of nowhere around page 100 and continue to dominate the later half of the book with the theories discussed in pages 70 to 100, never going anywhere, after the huge 70 page opening, yes many of you will be wasting your time, characters are introduced far too slowly, jacked around half way through the story and replaced by new characters towards the end, meaning what you have covered so far has been lost to the warping and bending of time in the story, unfortunately not working out as a good read, but maybe as good writing, and certainly Philip K. Dick can not be faulted for his literature skills, dialogue or introduction of descriptions that should have occurred towards the start of the book, we don't mind all of this, but the story thus is boring, without centre and does not deliver on a payoff like the last two or three pages of \\"The Man in the High Castle.\\" It isn't like that work at all. This is a self-serving science fiction rant to explain the author's own problems with mental health and infidelity.<br /><br />As many of you know Dick can be more suggestive than fleshing out those suggestions. Here he makes a suggestion that quite frankly we are not in the least bit interested in because of the way he puts it forward, that some people's mental illness can be confused with people who really have special talents, but the story boxes this concept into replaying a scene a couple of times over again in variation each time, the Martian Time-Slip explained by changes in people's perceptions, this concept comes up in the middle of the book, then takes a back seat to more suds and soap about adultery... and never emerges again. I am glad to be free of this book. That is not a good sign.<br /><br />It hurts me to say this but... \\"Martian Time-Slip\\" stinks. Only get it to see into the mind of a science-fiction writer beginning to question the depths of the mind and reasons for his own unfaithfulness. If you want to learn more about Dick through his work, then certainly this has lots of insight, but the story, not even close to what he is capable of doing.<br /><br />I am going to move onto \\"A Scanner Darkly\\" next. Hopefully that will go a bit better than this one did. Five stars all the way and then this bumpy ride. Only get this Philip K. Dick if you have read everything else. Comes nowhere even close to #13 place that Orion SF Masterworks gave it.frankly we are not in the least bit interested in because of the way he puts it forward, that some people's mental illness can be confused with people who really have special talents, but the story boxes this concept into replaying a scene a couple of times over again in variation each time, the Martian Time-Slip explained by changes in people's perceptions, this concept comes up in the middle of the book, then takes a back seat to more suds and soap about adultery... and never emerges again.

Thesaurasized, now there is an expression you don't hear everyday, much like every second word in this book, and to be honest most of them do not exist in reality either, this manuscript an interesting piece of literature, but I would read \\"The Name of the Rose\\" a hundred times over rather than go at this one again, and this is coming from someone who has actually read books like \\"The Trial of the Templars\\" by Malcolm Barber, Eco beckons us with the Templars' hidden mysteries, a theme that this novel deals with, in the last 150 pages of a book that is easily four times that size, 550 wordy-full pages, written as if Umberto has found a whipping boy he can use to convert a 100 paged novel into a huge piece of arcane knowledge via Thesaurasization, to be later transformed by time into an archaic must-read, possibly a contender next to James Joyce's Ulysses, but then why try to copy that style, the point being originality, but Eco does, and ends up binding a pointless beast of words, the pontificating of a good artist who has a healthy and vast knowledge of historical Italian events, coupled with multiple ways he can express this in terms of writing... goes off gallivanting into the world of muddy publishing, writers transfixed by politics, women, coffee shops and alcohol, brood over possible antediluvianismistic occult judiciousness as a message contained in the holy grail, THE MEANING OF LIFE, here it is according to Eco, obviously enjoying the fable he is creating while gadding about across the page in stuff he knows you will have to look up to understand, you will break often throughout the story and be all the more fed up with it, unless you have been diagnosed with longer life expectancy than most, then by-all-means, go for it.<br /><br />Over the period of a couple of months I reached the end. I did not retain half of what was eluded at, nor did I begin to care much for it, as the pages just wasted time, making sense only that this is a story about publishers chasing the meaning of life through a series of odd events. There is no logical reason for this novel to run anywhere near its length unless a few enjoy that sort of thing, as some probably did, but to be honest I have found better elsewhere in shorter versions that said an awful lot more in less time. If that is what Eco is eluding to here in this text, then it is a 'point' that took a lot time to get to get across... and all of it Thesaurasized at that.<br /><br />Praise to the five star reviews. I am happy you liked it. This one is fair warning for those who won't.meaning of life through a series of odd events.

If you liked the idea of Gary Soneji in the movie Along Came A Spider, then you will probably not mind reading Cat & Mouse, which is mostly about Gary Soneji, developing this character a lot more, but unfortunately doesn't deliver as good a second half with the serial killer of Mr. Smith which although is an interesting read does not really make the Soneji story any better, thus Cat & Mouse would have been a lot better if it skipped on Mr. Smith and did more with Soneji. This is one of the better Alex Cross reads and you could do a lot worse than Cat & Mouse, so in that respect it is one of Patterson's better books.
Clans of the Alphane Moon was written in the same year as three other books by Philip K Dick after he peaked early in his career with the Hugo award winning - The Man in the High Castle, highly original in either being a very divergent type of sci-fi or a deviating political comedy. Dick is often cited as the best science-fiction writer who does not write sci-fi, but some of his works, Do Androids Dream of Electric Sheep (Blade Runner) and UBIK, come across as more descriptive in the future they present, rather than ideology and dialogue driven. Clans of the Alphane Moon tends to be a situational environmental type of Dick presentation, rather than then latter, somewhat harder, but more heady science-fiction herbs that rely on dialogue and thoughts to tell their story. It is the environments the writer conjures up that makes this one of Dick's easier books to read, comprehend and probably enjoy.<br /><br />Clans of the Alphane Moon is like an early version of UBIK, developing a series of events, rather than a full story, to engage characters with other characters, in the most interesting of environments, under the most oddest circumstances. It focuses on dysfunctional relationships from the persona and how that is reiterated through the cosmos like an expanding fractal, Dick himself was married five times, here a couple, in process of getting separated, end up on a Moon run by the offspring clans of various mentally ill people who once occupied a Terra owned hospital there. Each clan has a personality character disorder that affects their role in life, down to their functions in government offices and their own disturbed nuclear family (again we have the dysfunctional relationship problem), with the looming background crisis of a CIA backed pharmaceutical company invading the Moon, to reclaim all the citizens and lands because they are all genetically insane - only to be double-crossed by Terra's entertainment industry, homicidal CIA agents turned scriptwriters, walking talking telepathic slime moulds, RBX303s and government executive love date drink spiking. It is not as funny or as heady as UBIK but certainly is a lot crazier.<br /><br />Alphane Moon has all the ingredients that you can expect in a good Dick novel but maybe not as much philosophy as it could have delivered on given such a rich premise, but then again Dick is always more suggestive and overall elusive in that he never delivers on it straight in a predictable way and is the reason why second guessing the next page will never turn out the way you expect making Alphane Moon as original as any of his other works with classic characters like CIA robot simulacra and slime moulds that regenerate by sporing when they die, a galactic mini-drama with an innovative design, although crazy in parts, that is exactly what the Alphane Moon is... but then again how do the people from Terra really compare?<br /><br />This is one of Dick's earlier works and maybe a little more down the avenue of choosing a follow up Dick novel to one of his more readable classics like Do Androids Dream of Electric Sheep or Ubik, where the reader is urged to go first, and certainly try to get in The Man in the High Castle to see how polarized this science-fiction writer is, the latter works towards the end of his career more metaphysical in nature as the writer descended into his own madness or genius (he believed an entity called VALIS was controlling him and even wrote a book about it).<br /><br />I choose this after reading \\"The Simulacra\\" and will move onto the other novel he did that same year \\"Martian Time-Slip\\" next.

Inspiring piece of worldly paranoia, that is truth, quoted well into the twenty first century as the future, and it is, not because mankind doesn't think it will ever go this way, but because we know full well we are, but somehow are allowing it to happen everyday. It is decentralization of power from the human being, in all aspects of one's life, to a higher power, a bigger cause, communism called the great Lucifer because all was given to the collective body and not to God, now God is the great Lucifer because we give ourselves to the collective body of something that we can not prove, so Science is the great Lucifer, producing weapons to kill the world a million times over, toxins to poison us a million times over, are all forms of giving to a collective body the nature of death?

Both works are inspiring pieces of worldly paranoia, that is truth, quoted well into the twenty first century as the future, and it is, not because mankind doesn't think it will ever go this way, but because we know full well we are, but somehow are allowing it to happen everyday. It is decentralization of power from the human being, in all aspects of one's life, to a higher power, a bigger cause, communism (more so in Animal Farm; but it would be error to say that it is just politics Orwell is hinting at) called the great Lucifer because all was given to the collective body and not to God, now God is the great Lucifer because we give ourselves to the collective body of something that we can not prove, so Science is the great Lucifer, producing weapons to kill the world a million times over, toxins to poison us a million times over, are all forms of giving to a collective body the nature of death? Is it the giving to a collective body that robs the soul of its power? Is it giving oneself wholly and utterly to something other than one's own self the conduit of decent into the investment of despair. 1984 sees men and women working their themselves to skin and bone to achieve a greater good that never emerges, the ultimate failings masked by a strict authoritative regime, BIG BROTHER, the power all seeing and ever controlling, rewriting history, editing the world around them, at war with this nation one minute and switching to another the next, neighbours up and vanish and protagonists invest in each other for but a fleeting glimpse of love only to be captured by the THOUGHT POLICE for engaging in illegal activity, men at the top of this society using torture and mind control to enforce a pathology of unquestionable and undeniable supremacy of all the power to the BIG BROTHER system, and that this is the system and that is why they are alive at all, at which point we question if it is worth living at all to which Orwell delivers a resounding, no, of course it is not worth living this life, why bother at all, and that this is a piece of work that must be understood by everyone and anyone who can read and is certainly mandatory reading for anyone in least bit interested in politics or political science.<br /><br />Unfortunately however we tend to vote in military commanders, lawyers and extreme capitalists into government and then ask why it is all going down hill.<br /><br />The problem is there is no terminology in the English language to describe the act of one human being killing their unborn future children by process of setting up a bad management system with a legal body incorporated into that system before they die.

The Warren Report is the basic starting point for anybody who is even remotely interested in researching the JFK assassination. The book is massive - nearly 2 inches thick, 9 inches in length and 6 inches in width and clocks in at 888 pages. There are many illustrations and photographs to help break the monotony and they are helpful in understanding the text.<br /><br />Be forewarned. This report is not to be taken at face value. It promotes itself while at the same time laying blame on everybody from Oswald to the Secret Service and the Dallas County Police. You have every right to be critical of this book because of its omissions. One of the most important pieces of evidence - the autopsy photographs - have been completely omitted. Not because they would serve as only disturbing the American people and the Kennedy family but because they where deliberately HOAXED when revealed to the public through the media. There is no excuse for providing the American people with autopsy photographs of another dead man who was not President Kennedy. The original autopsy photographs have since come to light and these shed new information on the case. The report does not even touch on that topic. These photographs alone should warrant deep consideration by the even the most hardened lone-gunman supporters. How can the Warren Report expound on the wrongness of the Dallas Police revealing inaccurate case information when itself is staying shut-mouthed on the deliberately hoaxed autopsy photographs? This kind of hypocrisy is mind shattering and only serves to drive home the most important item of interest of the whole affair - that the US government is knowingly and deliberately hiding evidence and information to protect some interest. You must read more elsewhere to learn the full facts of the case and the other host of omissions that where deliberately kept aside from this report.<br /><br />The warren commission report starts with its summary and conclusions - that Oswald acted alone in killing President Kennedy and that there was no conspiracy. It then gives a brief synopsis of the assassination and the circumstances surrounding the events on November 22nd 1963. The report continues by developing the scenario in the Texas School Book Depository including the evidence gained from witnesses at the scene and the recovery of the riffle, spent shells and prints. Connections are established between Oswald and the riffle and the School Book Depository building before moving on to the motive and Oswalds background.<br /><br />The report then deals with Oswalds detention, the media, Oswalds murder and his assassin - Jack Ruby. The next chapter deals with investigating a possible conspiracy before laying out Oswalds background in detail. Next up the Warren report deals with the protection of the President and concludes the entire events on page 468. The remainder of the book goes in-depth with expert witness testimony with several recommendations and more background on Oswald.<br /><br />In the end you are left feeling that Oswald was involved in the assassination one way or another and certainly the slaying of Officer J.D Tippit by Oswald is the clincher. The murder of patrolman Tippit is a key event which shows that Oswald was capable of murder and was also on a killing frenzy at the time of the assassination. He also tried to shoot officers when he was apprehended in the film theatre. Did Oswald shoot President Kennedy? Probably Yes. Could the Magic bullet theory work? It is possible. Did Jack Ruby kill Oswald on the spur of the moment? The facts surrounding this are vague. Did Oswald act alone? It is possible but unlikely. Does the Warren report do justice for the American people and the people of the world? Absolutely not. Does the Warren report deliberately neglect important and relevant information? Absolutely. Would an impartial jury convict Oswald on the assassination of President Kennedy based on the evidence? Probably not because there istoo much doubt at large to deal with. Would an impartial jury convict Oswald of the murder J.D Tippit? Yes. Is there a cover-up and if so why?<br /><br />The truth is that there is probably a cover-up involved and the Warren report as it stands today is absolute proof that the US government at the time was knee-deep in a conspiracy of some kind simply based on its omissions and neglect to deal with highly important and relevant evidence. Was there a government conspiracy to assassinate the President? Probably not, but there was a cover-up of a conspiracy of some kind and this is what is at the heart of the whole assassination and the follow up events including this report. A blind eye has probably been turned to the truth surrounding the assassination because President Kennedy was considered an obstacle to many important people. In fact the Warren Commission report has all the hallmarks of a new administration that just wants to sweep everything under the carpet.<br /><br />All in all this is a five star book, not because of the quality of the report, but because its contents when compared to what we now know only serve as a reminder that even the administrators of what is supposed to be a leading democratic and free nation can act in such a wreckful and manipulative manner.<br /><br />In short Oswald was definitely firing shots from the Dallas School Book Depository building. He owned the gun that shot at the president. He murdered a police officer and tried to kill more. He also tried to assassinate Maj. Gen. Edwin A. Walker but failed. The chances that Oswald was the only one firing shots at President Kennedy that fateful day in Dallas are slim. When you add an extra shooter the whole thing falls into place. To quote Occams Razor - When explaining a thing, no more assumptions should be made than are necessary.<br /><br />Magic Bullet vs more than one assassin? - The extra assassin is simply the more logical conclusion easily.there is too much doubt at large to deal with.

The Man in the High Castle is the Hugo award winning, now modern classic book, by Philip K. Dick, a relatively unknown 50s sci-fi writer who peaked early with this 60s novel, bringing him critical acclaim, launching sci-fi as real life drama, only to vanish for 20 years as he churned out what was considered pulp sci-fi for small circulars, only to have Hollywood turn his book - Do Androids Dream of Electric Sheep, into a failed movie called Blade Runner, that is now a cult classic in the 21st century, help putting Philip K. Dick back on the map again with more movie adaptations (Total Recall, Minority Report) long after his death, the result of health complications (reoccurring heart disease and insanity), just before the release of Blade Runner. It has taken nearly 50 years for this writer to actually gain public attention... which in many ways has stiffed the guy of funds he should have had to work with, but then again maybe his profession as a sci-fi writer on the poverty-line is somewhat rewarding in that he has left us heaps of literature to enjoy, the true chronicles of a determined writer.<br /><br />TMITHC is written in the same vein as 1984, Animal Farm and Brave New World, penned with the same urgent worldly paranoia coupled with philosophical genius. This archetype manuscript, the first to actually use alternative history as a theme, concerns a substitute present where WWII has been won by the Germans and the Japanese who control America, now suppressing whites and Jews, who run small businesses in order to earn a living, like Mr. Childen who operates a rare American memorabilia antique store, a speciality retailer for the rich Japanese ambassadors and military officials like Mr. Tagomi, only for Childen to find that some anonymous Jew (Frank Frink) is making fake items to earn a living and so Mr. Childen sets off to find out who is putting his job at risk while the Japanese build the new world infrastructure using the religious oracle, I Ching, as their guiding light only to discover that a mysterious man in a high castle, Hawthorne Abendsen, has written a book, The Grasshopper Lies Heavy, where America wins the war and so censor the book, while the Reich is in turmoil because the Chancellor is dead and needs to be replaced, Hitler lies in a sanatorium incapacitated and driven insane from syphilis. Juliana, the ex-wife of the Jewish artefact fabricator Fink, goes on the run across America with a mysterious Italian named Joe who may be a spy, while looking for the man in the high castle, discovers something startling about how the banned book was written that surprises the reader as a final twist to these series of events that help support the background psychological alternative world that the author creates without directly implying it much.<br /><br />Avoiding any sort of descriptive sci-fi world Philip K. Dick sticks heavy to describing psychosomatic thoughts and dialogue, exploring the clash of cultures from the perspective of an American who is no longer understood as a person with identity but a sideshow salesman for the Japs. There are lots of events which cross the story, penetrating the characters and changing them, all based on the book of changes, the I Ching... the oracle that they all used to guide them through whatever life they live. The Man in the High Castle is a book about illusion and change.<br /><br />This book is for seasoned readers of modern classics and fans of Philip K Dick. It is less sci-fi than you may anticipate as this is his early stuff so it is more psychologically analytical and less descriptive on environments, also the dialogue is not as perfect as his later works, but it is all there in the making. This book is what you should go on to after reading Do Androids Dream of Electric Sheep, a good starting point, which is midway in his sci-fi development (more descriptions, more dialogue, better editing and stronger plots) the end of his career was out-there stuff that generated hisown private genre - metaphysical fiction. Philip K. Dick eventually believed that he was been contacted by an entity called VALIS that appeared to him in a beam of light. He wrote a book about it. He also wrote a private, couple of thousand paged novel, called Exegesis, describing his visitations. This Hugo Winning book created a whole new realm for other writers to explore. It was the author who actually took that flame and ran with it but was never noticed during his extensive self investment into his original creations. Philip K Dick is probably the most important sci-fi writer of our time not to mention prophetic, whose books make more sense now than they did then.

This book is fantastic but its two other sequels are not worth reading. The story is about a very large mysterious asteroid that takes up an orbit around the earth. The only problem is that the inner dimensions do not match the outer dimensions. The story becomes a race between the Russians and the Americans to see who can get to the asteroid first to study the findings.<br /><br />Eon is about another world, which exists inside this rock, but is also a portal to a dimension called THE WAY which is inhabited by millions and billions of different species. The WAY is also going through a dramatic change and it is up to the explorers to discover what the WAY truly is and why the asteroid has arrived to orbit the Earth. Lots of story and action but be careful because the actual descriptions of the places in this book require a lot of imagination. Great story, great plot, lots of action and a great character called Olmy.<br /><br />My bet is that the Matrix filmmakers will try and give this book a bash sometime. It is said to be un-filmable but maybe they can pull it off. The production company is also called EON... hmmmm...
Nichole Thibodeaux is the First Lady who through her Martha Stewert type personality has remained in control of the government for over 70 years with daily White House television shows that have transfixed a nation conditioned by automatic advertisements that have the ability of thought control, meaning that the last line of defense, Dr. Superb, a psychotherapist, must try to maintain his capicity in society, even though his business has been outlawed by drug companies like A.G Chemie, who sponsor the mind control adverts and influence the government who have a time machine and are able to control the future somewhat except for the precogs in society who can tilt the balance.<br /><br />There is no hope left for humanity in a world that is becoming ever maladjusted to the electronic conditioning, their love for Nichole and conforming to what she likes, except to grab a Loony Luke Jalopy and head off for mars for an alternative life. Luke has a sales papoola, a synthetic man made alien lifeform from mars that can influence people to like whatever the owners wants. One of Lukes workers steals the papoola to impress Nichole at the White House only to uncover a sinister plot where all is not as it seems and the Presidential executive all might be actors and Simulacra robots.<br /><br />A secret policeman ND, Pembroke, has allowed Dr. Superb to work as a psychotherapist, so that he will meet someone who the doctor will fail to treat, as the time machine Lessinger apparatus predicted, unless the person seeks chemical treatment from A.G Chemie, become cured, and put the whole fabric of society in jeopardy. While all this is happening special mutant musician, Richard Kongrosian, who can play the keyboard with his mind, is having an emotional breakdown and believes he is becoming both invisible and smelly, only to start finding out things about himself that makes the government afraid of him.<br /><br />Philip K. Dick conjures a frightening realistic world where people adore leaders based on image, are afraid to think outside of the norm or else are reduced in status... while living in a time where entertainment, coporate drugs companies and shadow governments control the world... all written back in 1964... over thirty years ago... and more is relevant than ever today.<br /><br />The Simulacra is strong on dialogue given that this is one of his Philip K. Dicks early works. There are references to characters in his award winning book The Man in the High Castle with the same sort of everything comes home type of surreal adventure... the endings are both somewhat similar, although The Simulacra has a much more black humerious one.<br /><br />Like we have said, given the current times, this book stands out as more important than ever. Sci Fi comes true yet again. This book is listed as number 57 in science fiction masteroworks released by Orion publishers. I recommend if new to Dick that you start with Do Androids Dream of Electric Sheep, The Man in the High Castle, Ubik and then this one. I will be moving onto Clans of Alphane Moon next.

Do Androids Dream of Electric Sheep is an excellent introduction into the sci-fiction/philosophical masterworks* (*emphasis on master - Dick is a noted literary genius) of Philip K. Dick because this is one of his best works and also most of you have seen a very close adaptation of this book, a film called Blade Runner, which unfortunately was released to box office failure shortly after K. Dick's death, only later to become a cult classic that no one has missed from their DVD collection.<br /><br />Dick's books must be viewed along with writer's ambitions and warnings. In 1968 Dick wrote this story a year before man landed on the moon and yet describes a world somewhere closer to our own, in a `very soon down the road' roundabout way, as Dick does in all his books. Do Androids Dream of Electric Sheep is no different, describing an environmental catastrophic event that leads to Earth's ruin, where humans have migrated to offshore colony worlds, where they get a free human cyborg - a replicant, to serve them. Back on the earth those who remain live in a world where everything is synthetic, the atmosphere radioactive, and where everyone dreams of owning a real live pet, and not a clone controlled by microchips and circuit boards, including our protagonist, Deckard, a professional bounty-hunter cop, with secret ambitions of replacing his electronic sheep with real ones before the neighbours found out how poor he is, so takes on a contract to hunt down and `retire' a group dangerous renegade replicants that escaped from the offshore world colony of Nexus 6, murdering people during the break out and who have managed to make their way to earth blending in with the local population.<br /><br />Deckard who is looking forward to buying some real sheep goes to visit the Tyrell corporation where he uses, the now unforgettable, Voigt-Kampff test, to see if a human is a cyborg. The Voigt-Kampff test is the key to opening the philosophical mindset of this book - \\"Is empathy only a human condition?\\" with the psychology that a replicant will test negative for empathy during the test. The question then arises for Deckard, \\"has he ever retired a human by mistake?\\" Dick challenges us to think about this (look at the books title) as Deckard runs across the city retiring replicants who appear to lack empathy only to suddenly find himself up against a new type of Nexus 6 that does not lack empathy and has the ability to learn it. The book will keep you second guessing as to who is real and who is not, but at its heart the question Do Androids Dream of Electric Sheep in conjunction with Deckard's job, and his desire to own real sheep, leads him slowly down a path of questioning this own existence and reassessing his life and what he thought he knew. The book finished beautifully, answering these questions to the full with a bit of a revelation.<br /><br />However we would do Dick a disservice, not to at least complement the writer's ability to craft the English language, and more importantly, edit his work to perfection. This is a page turner, without any interlude or boring descriptions. Everything will be absorbed at a fine reading pace. Dick also manages to come up with about 70% dialogue, all of it beautifully written with characterisation that actually goes somewhere. The story is also very exciting!<br /><br />You will no doubt read another Dick book after finishing this one even if you do not like science-fiction. I also finished his awarding winning \\"The Man in the High Castle\\" and \\"UBIK\\". And why not? Dick is possibly the best science-fiction writer ever who does not write science-fiction. Maybe the only one that could that. I would read his whole chronicles (50+ books) just after having read this one.<br /><br />Bravo - a whole new writer with a massive collection to read.nly a human condition?\\" with the psychology that a replicant will test negative for empathy during the test.

An Alienist was an old term to describe a psychiatrist (a person who studies alienated people) and given that the start of the nineteen hundreds was to turn medical science on its head, this little tale takes us back to the origins of how and why it changed, by developing the process of psychiatry (or to be more precise behavioral science) with the analysis of a story about a Serial Killer roaming the rooftops of New York City, to murder and disfigure male child prostitutes that he has kidnapped for some strange reason, told through the eyes of New York Times journalist - John Moore, as he recalls this period of his life and which he wishes to commit to the page.<br /><br />Moore is called to a crime scene by a friend of his, Dr. Laszlo Kreizler, the Alienist, to help him with an enquiry. They hook up with the police commissioner, Theodore Roosevelt and Sara Howard, the first woman police officer in New York, to investigate the murders along with two `new age' brother detectives with a scientific bent - Marcus and Lucius. The problem is that the city does not care about the murder of child prostitutes, new policing techniques and Dr. Kreizler has some unorthodox views about metal illness that do not get him much respect in the city. Using Kreizler's ideas about the psychology of the killer the team decides to \\"profile\\" the killer to see if they can track him down before he commits the next murder. The Alienist - for all intensive purposes - is about the complex process of developing that profile and this is where the strength of the book really is and is main reason why you will enjoy reading it.<br /><br />Apart from that deductive element The Alienist is really a run-of-the-mill \\"hunt the serial killer\\" type clich&eacute;d material. It does not really move outside of anything we have seen or read before (the analysis of the sexual orientation of killer is akin to that of what we have seen before in Silence of the Lambs) , but it does do exceptionally well in the psychology of criminal behavior department and to be honest you do not really get a chance to see this in `fiction' much which gives the every day Joe Soap a chance to learn a bit about the early days of forensics and psychiatry.<br /><br />For instance, one of the detectives manages within 24 hours of examining a murder victim to find that the killer uses a huge hunting knife and procures the very same knife by conducting cutting tests with various types of knifes that he has purchased around the city. These little forensic type discoveries are a joy to read and then when applied to the actual profile they are developing, helps take the case one step further. Here they are dealing with a man they have never met, who is cunning and smart and yet by using science and logic are able to track him down even though they do not have the techniques we have today like fingerprinting, DNA testing and security video tapes. So there is a struggle there in the book which sort of explains how the minority must go against the majority sometimes in order to advance mankind. It is all great stuff.<br /><br />Carr does a good job of creating a tense atmosphere with vivid descriptions of a late 1800s New York City with all its political corruption, street violence and the gangster owned parts of town. He also does not shy away from describing the more grotesque parts of the story (various mutilations are covered in EXTREME detail along with a final act that is quite chilling), so this can be X-rated material at times and hard to stomach - however the English is first rate and a thrill to dive into the dictionary now again without breaking the flow of the story.<br /><br />In spite of this The Alienist does have some negatives for all its positives. The first is that the motives for the killings are never fully explained and many loose ends are left untied - specifically how and why the killer did what he did. So even though the amazing detective work helps to find the killer, the whole psychology element really does fly out the window and you realize that in many ways you have been had. The story is about catching the killer and putting him out of commission, but Carr focuses a lot on developing the profile of the killer only to pull the rug out from us in the end in a sort - \\"I guess we will never really know sort of way\\" and that can annoying for some. I can get over some plot devices and story elements that are little corny or some parts that are farfetched (really just Hollywood suspension of disbelief type plots) but the lack of cohesion in the end really took a star of this thing in a big way. This is not a good call given the time you will spend reading and learning about the profile they are creating. I am sure those who have little contact with crime fiction will find the book more than satisfactory but those with experience may not like where it all leads.<br /><br />Don't let that put you off though. It is still a hell of a good read - just don't spend too much time trying to work things out because it will be a futile attempt by the time you turn the end pages. Having said that though I would certainly check out this author's other works just on the bases of having read this one. The bottom line is that this is a descent crime drama with a detailed exploration of early psychiatry and forensic work.hole psychology element really does fly out the window and you realize that in many ways you have been had.

I read this years ago and it was very good and made into a film that is not all that bad. Basically the premise is that a family man dies and is reincarnated as a dog, returns to his family and tries to help reveal his killer to them. It is fairly formula stuff but the fact that the dog's perspective is written so well coupled with a story that is a little more adult than your average fantasy novel, almost horror, makes it compelling adult fairy-tale reading. I recommend it because it is very original, unusual and actually one of the better books from this British author who deserves to be discovered a little more in the west. It is good writing. I also recommend Creed.
Remember the movie The Omen where David Warner's character, a photographer, starts to find strange images in the photographs he takes of people? Well Creed is one big book about that as paparazzo Joe Creed, a character of the Princess Diana chasing type, finds himself photographing an important figure doing something over a coffin after a funeral which results in various forces coming after him to get the negatives. Creed then begins to unravel a world where monsters and demons exist and are aided by the rich and famous who he makes his living from. It makes for an original piece of reading, although not exactly hollywood material, comes across as very frightening most of the time and for that does exactly what it says on the label. Well worth discovering Herbert through this book and his other good one, Fluke.
As you are all well aware Michael Moore has Bibliographies in his books but since Fahrenheit 911 was a motion picture documentary he could not do one for that type of medium. Well guess what? Mike has not stopped his policy of backing up his facts, hence The F911 Reader which does just that.<br /><br />A familiar theme we hear from right wing extremist groups is that Michael Moore is a liar - that most of what he says is made up - not real - his conjecture - his lies. This to me comes as a bit of a surprise because somehow these readers (and I use that word with caution in this context) must have missed the 25% to 33% bibliography content in his latest post-911 books. Maybe the fact is that some people can not run a finger to that little number in the back pages and read the resources... maybe some of them can not read? Or... it is more likely that they just have not read his books at all? Do they really believe that Mike does zero research or something? The answer to most of the hate rants is in the bibliographies if one right wing extremist bothered themselves so much as to actually read on past the final chapter.<br /><br />\\"bib·li·og·ra·phy\\"<br /><br />  1. A list of the works of a specific author or publisher.<br /><br />  2.<br /><br />  1. A list of writings relating to a given subject: a bibliography of Latin American history.<br /><br />  2. A list of writings used or considered by an author in preparing a particular work.<br /><br />  3.<br /><br />  1. The description and identification of the editions, dates of issue, authorship, and typography of books or other written material.<br /><br />  2. A compilation of such information.<br /><br />Got that????<br /><br />If anyone has any doubts as to anything then why not doubt the source? NEVER will a right wing extremist ever point to the source material as corrupted or incorrect. It is always about Moore being wrong like he does it from thin air or something. As soon as I hear people attacking Moore, for being Moore, and because it comes out from Moore's gob, I really have to question the orientation of the mentality that seems to not be able to grasp where ALL of this stuff is actually coming from. The closest we get is in some pseudo anti-Moore (yeah Anti-Moore) home movie that tracks down some war vet who was captured by Moore in the spur of moment saying something maybe he shouldn't have said and now wants to change his tune (isn't it so strange how that moment of reality is not considered real when compared to a pre-prepared statement read by the vet who disavows what he said previously... in fact the reality of ALL of these little moments is what makes Moore's work so interesting.) or some newspaper that claims it didn't want its paper mentioned in Moore's work. Let's face it - Moore is bad for the military industrial complex as a whole. Nobody who makes money out of killing is going to have much love for this man.<br /><br />Anyway the Reader does what all of his other works have done before - giving a full scale resource and bibliography foundation to F911. The truth is that when reading a book like this you know all to well that a Michael Moore hate group is actually based on the fact that is far easier to attack a fat man than it is to actually do the work... to actually DO THE WORK and READ and FOLLOWUP on the Bibliographies. There within the confines of a quick internet scan for related documents will reveal the proper orientation for one who is to critique Moore's work and not the man himself. This book is yet another testament to the fact that the person actually doing the work is Moore himself. Moore is an avid researcher who had no problem uncovering what you are not allowed to see or know. He then goes that step forward, seeking out his sources, filming them, and putting it for us up on the big screen. It is all about the facts.<br /><br />This book contains the actual F911 screenplay so it is a must for anybody who wants to read the documentary.The next part of the book is the resources and bibliography - the backup - the evidence. The latter part of the book is then writings about the film itself, including critiques, letters or praise or contempt before finally showing us some funny pictures and shots of cinemas outside F911 screenings.<br /><br />As someone who is interested in films, F911 is actually something unheard of in the annuals of film making, and is the reason why it won Cannes, but reading through the later part of this book really helps expand on why. I think anybody interested in film making should really get this book to nitpick the fundamental principles behind the making of this movie, its production value, the final distribution fiasco, censor ratings, rating enforcement, and how cinema screenings are affected by all of this. For me this was the gem of the book.<br /><br />Anyhow the bottom line is that this book is just yet another reason why attacking Moore for being fat is hell of a lot easier than actually DOING THE WORK. Do the work and attain the goal. See things for what they really are. It is as easy as that.documentary. The next part of the book is the resources and bibliography - the backup - the evidence.

Do Androids Dream of Electric Sheep is an excellent introduction into the sci-fiction/philosophical masterworks* (*emphasis on master - Dick is a noted literary genius) of Philip K. Dick because this is one of his best works and also most of you have seen a very close adaptation of this book, a film called Blade Runner, which unfortunately was released to box office failure shortly after K. Dick's death, only later to become a cult classic that no one has missed from their DVD collection.<br /><br />Dick's books must be viewed along with writer's ambitions and warnings. In 1968 Dick wrote this story a year before man landed on the moon and yet describes a world somewhere closer to our own, in a `very soon down the road' roundabout way, as Dick does in all his books. Do Androids Dream of Electric Sheep is no different, describing an environmental catastrophic event that leads to Earth's ruin, where humans have migrated to offshore colony worlds, where they get a free human cyborg - a replicant, to serve them. Back on the earth those who remain live in a world where everything is synthetic, the atmosphere radioactive, and where everyone dreams of owning a real live pet, and not a clone controlled by microchips and circuit boards, including our protagonist, Deckard, a professional bounty-hunter cop, with secret ambitions of replacing his electronic sheep with real ones before the neighbours found out how poor he is, so takes on a contract to hunt down and `retire' a group dangerous renegade replicants that escaped from the offshore world colony of Nexus 6, murdering people during the break out and who have managed to make their way to earth blending in with the local population.<br /><br />Deckard who is looking forward to buying some real sheep goes to visit the Tyrell corporation where he uses, the now unforgettable, Voigt-Kampff test, to see if a human is a cyborg. The Voigt-Kampff test is the key to opening the philosophical mindset of this book - \\"Is empathy only a human condition?\\" with the psychology that a replicant will test negative for empathy during the test. The question then arises for Deckard, \\"has he ever retired a human by mistake?\\" Dick challenges us to think about this (look at the books title) as Deckard runs across the city retiring replicants who appear to lack empathy only to suddenly find himself up against a new type of Nexus 6 that does not lack empathy and has the ability to learn it. The book will keep you second guessing as to who is real and who is not, but at its heart the question Do Androids Dream of Electric Sheep in conjunction with Deckard's job, and his desire to own real sheep, leads him slowly down a path of questioning this own existence and reassessing his life and what he thought he knew. The book finished beautifully, answering these questions to the full with a bit of a revelation.<br /><br />However we would do Dick a disservice, not to at least complement the writer's ability to craft the English language, and more importantly, edit his work to perfection. This is a page turner, without any interlude or boring descriptions. Everything will be absorbed at a fine reading pace. Dick also manages to come up with about 70% dialogue, all of it beautifully written with characterisation that actually goes somewhere. The story is also very exciting!<br /><br />You will no doubt read another Dick book after finishing this one even if you do not like science-fiction. I am going to move onto his awarding winning \\"The Man in the High Castle\\" next. And why not? Dick is possibly the best science-fiction writer ever who does not write science-fiction. Maybe the only one that could that.<br /><br />Bravo.nly a human condition?\\" with the psychology that a replicant will test negative for empathy during the test.

Black House is unfortunately bundled as a horror serial killer novel when in fact it is closer to fantasy in the same vein as Clive Barker, not to mention it is a sequel that does not quite work as a standalone book. Those of you who enjoyed the Dark Tower series or prequel to this one, The Talisman, will probably return to fond memories. Those who are looking from a clean slate perspective will only throw it down in boredom. Black House IS for die-hard fantasy King fans only. I got it because I liked `Eyes of the Dragon' but sadly I was mistaken as to its nature. This is not really what I expected. It was not really a King book I should have started reading.<br /><br />Black House presents itself as testament to the fact that horror literature can be written well. Black House is as grammatically perfect as you can get with well written passages, realistic dialogue and fine descriptions. It is all honours A+ writing that is polished to a `T' for maximum presentation of that fine English language that you, the reader, deserve from two big names like King and Straub. However Black House is tremendously overlong and wrought with descriptions that seem to last for days. For instance the first 100 pages of this novel deals with nothing more than setting up the basic structure of many lanes, landmarks, people and places only to barely bring 1% of what is mentioned to life throughout the remainder of this super-sized horror book. Breaking into the introduction of the lead protagonist occurs close to the 200 page mark. At this stage most of us are halfway through a normal sized novel and this one has not even begun... not that we don't mind big set-ups for chunky books, but Black House does not sum it up very well, unlike horror classics such as The Stand which have the same super-sized start-up. This initiation seems more like page filler - great English, but still just filler material. The book centres on a child killer called The Fisherman, who eats parts of his victims and leaves taunting messages to the police and the victim's parents. The cast however are never fully explored within the 300 odd-so setup pages. For some reason Black House talks a lot but says very little. I found it lacking character substance and instead delivering on character predicament, leaving holes as to what makes some characters tick and why they are different from others. Everybody seemed the same. In page 200 we learn who the killer is. At page 300 Henry, a blind DJ, with a huge character setup, is told that he will be useful in identifying a caller's voice. Henry eventually gets round to it at page 650, but by then the previous 200 pages involving bikers and hell angels preventing people from entering a child murder crime scene, building up relationships with the police officers, becomes naught as the lead protagonist has found that the Serial Killer is able to travel to his victim's via a portal that leads to another dimension. And our protagonist can go to this dimension and hunt the killer to rescue a kidnapped child. From then until page 820 it is all wizards, reincarnation and magic.<br /><br />I guess the reason why I was disappointed was in the book's packaging. I expected a horror story more akin to the synopsis on the back cover and instead got very long fan boy entry in the Dark Tower / Talisman series. I also felt that Clive Barker does this better and that King has had much better fantasy books in this same genre. Sadly Black House is a real misfire in terms of what it could have been.es taunting messages to the police and the victim's parents.

You know when someone has not read \\"Dude, Where's My Country?\\"... (like the authors of that terrible money spinning anti-Moore book who stuck a picture of him on their cover to make a buck... why can't they use their own faces?? HUH... Tell me Why $$$$$!!) .....when they start to complain about the lack of facts in this book. Let us be clear here for a moment - this book has 10% of it devoted to resources at the back which YOU can check up on. The font on those pages is actually half the size so 20% of this book has sources noted. Moore provides us with a fully comprehensive bibliography. So for the phoney self-proclaimed democrats who say yeah they like Moore, but his facts are wrong, you have obviously NOT READ THE BOOK or even checked out that bibliography, period.<br />This quite comical, page turning (don't you just read Moore's book completely as soon as you open the first page!) political satire begins by asking George W Bush several questions that he has not yet answered in relation to 9/11 and these are important - like his ties to the Bin Laden family and why he let members of the Bin Laden family flee America after 9/11 - many good questions that have still not been answered by the man are put forth by Moore. Then Moore goes through the lies before 9/11 and after, citing all the major whoppers that Bush served up for us. We get a few pages on the up and coming oil crisis (very important to learn about and a pity there was not more about such an important issue and the backbone of the Iraq war). Moore then brings up the theme of FEAR again, which he covered in Bowling for Columbine, but brings it up here because since Bowling, Bush just hasn't stopped with the fear... nor have the media. He is merely showing us predictions that continue to come true with this administration. We then get 16 easy ways of how to stop terrorism by starting in the home. Like in Stupid White Men, Moore gives us a prayer to recite in hope that the bad guys in government have heart attacks tomorrow. It is all just so well written and so funny yet tragic that this is the way the government has opted to treat its own people. He then writes a piece about Bush's tax cuts for the rich while leaving the poor without any. Probably the best chapter is near the end. It is called \\"How to talk to your conservative brother in law\\" and had me in hysterics. After this chapter we get the low down on how to remove Bush from power.<br />All in all this is the prequel for Fahrenheit 9/11 and certainly mandatory reading for catching up on the whole question of just who will be in Government come 2005. For this Moore says we need to get Bush out, which means at this time voting for Kerry probably. However many critics have mistaken Moore's support for Kerry as being Moore's final agenda. This is not correct. Moore repeatedly states that a GREEN party would be stronger than the Democrats and is aiming for a 2008 Green win! This can be done by either forming a coalition between Democrats and Greens or the Greens going for it themselves. This is a good idea because already the Democrats see Kerry as the liberal front of their party; however there are not many good Greens and especially not really good ones like Moore.<br />The bottom line is that the man writing this book could very well be on his way to the White House sooner than most people think. This guy is not only the new poster boy for a new American government but he has, virtually on his own, defined how politics will be shaped in the 21st century! Imagine President Moore giving his State of Union address via your theatres or producing documentaries and programs to help educate everyday Americans about their own political system and how you can help make things better. Moore makes politics interesting for us! If that is not the single most important quality of a leader then what is? Thank this man for helping wake up America. Get him into the Oval Office and there will be no stopping what America can doto help the rest of the world. With this man in charge it is possible that we just might see a year's Military spending being diverted to converting 3rd world countries into 1st world nations. This is the man that we all need to represent us. He loves life and people. Go on Republicans - get a heart and try a bite from THE UP AND COMING NEXT PRESIDENT OF THE UNITED STATES OF AMERICA's Twinkie bar.to help the rest of the world.

As some of you know I have already written a review but the reviewer Hiromi said that everything in this book was mostly a lie, so I spent a few months checking things up and it appears that he is wrong, has read some other book(s), but whatever he did he certainly hasn't read this one. This book is probably not only an indictment of Japanese Human Biological Experiments but a condemnation of a US military industrial system that allowed the perpetrators to escape as long as the data fell into US hands and not the Soviets. The first thing to point out is that there are documented photographs of the biological experiments but this book does not reproduce them, even though they are extremely disturbing and show that these experiments occurred. You can find most of these pictures on the net. One picture shows a doctor with his hand inside a live POW on the operating table - another picture shows the bodies being stacked outside. So even though these pictures are not in the book they can be found on-line.<br />Basically before WWII the Japanese where world leaders in military medicine and during the Manchurian invasion took Chinese POWs to death camps for medical experimentation to advance science under the guidance of Professor Ishii Shiro, one of the most respected members of the Japanese medical community. America was not the world leader in biological weapons experimentation. Neither was the Soviet Union or Britain. It is all started right here in Japan.<br />The experiments were deemed so advantageous and necessary (because they both saved lives and killed massive amounts of the enemy) that the Japanese military built fortresses entirely devoted to human experimentation and bacteria stockpiling. This involved injecting a rat with a bacteria and then allowing a flea in a jar to feed on the rat. By creating stockpiles of infected fleas they would then design bombs to drop the fleas into towns and cities, but not before they experimented on POWs first. One experiment involved arranging POWs tied to crosses in circles in a field and then detonating the infected flea bombs in the centre to see how far the fleas could travel before infecting the host.<br />One of the most documented human experiment programs took place in a location called &quot;Ping Fang&quot; and included surgical work done on POWs not under an aesthetic, freezing POWs for frostbite tests and infecting POWs with Cholera, Epidemic Hemorrhagic Fever and THE PLAGUE all of which this book ties to the Japanese civil sector and the government under the control of a special branch called Unit 731.<br />This book even describes Japanese attempts at launching biological attacks on America and how after America took control of the Japans the whole thing was kept quiet so that the US military could get hold of the data as part of its Cold War. Some speculate that the data was not that important - however, this is no excuse for what happened to the POWs who where experimented on. We have records of what happened. For the first time Hal Gold publishes the transcripts of those documents which show US/Japanese collusion to keep this data out of the hands of the Soviets, period, end of story. But all this war crime stuff is pretty irrelevant these days because currently the White House has not signed up to the International Criminal Court. The denial of this kind of activity is outrageous and all we need to do is look to camp X-ray or even Abu Gharib to see the treatment of POWs even at the hands of what is considered the world leader is `freedoms' and `human rights'.<br />If there where any `mind control' techniques involved, as some reviewers have suggested to distance Japan and the US from these atrocities, then really you have to point out that these techniques where in fact conducted on the POWs by the scientists that froze their limbs or injected them with poison. The proof in the pudding- America advanced its biological weapons program x 1000 because of what the Japanese had discovered. So much so they where eventually selling advanced prototype weapons (the Japanese also designed PLAGUE BOMBS and photographs of these are in the book) to people like Saddam to fight the cold war in Iran.<br />The second half of this important book is devoted entirely to witness testimony and confessions - MANY OF WHOM ARE JAPANESE and not communistic Chinese or Russians as some reviewers have suggested. The Japanese or US government have never admitted to these war crimes but the evidence is now available for everyone to see. Many of the death camps and human experimentation factories are still standing today not to mention the fact that mass graves have been found at the experimentation sites and that the bones on the skeletons had been surgically tampered with on nearly every single body recovered that can not be explained as just war victims. Right now these bodies are being examined to try and find where they are from. Many of the skeleton shapes and sizes show that the majority of these bodies are NOT JAPANESE. Also there is the small matter of confessions and witness testimony being backed up physical evidence. The experimentation sites are mostly still standing today!<br />This is a pocket sized book, but an essential history lesson that is still a holocaust in denial.

TV NATION is also written by Kathleen Glynn but this book is Moore through and through and is much easier on the brain than Moore's other publications and certainly a lot Moore fun. You can get TV NATION on VHS at the moment but the DVD release is on the way soon. Basically Moore and his production team got backing to do a television series about various topics in America that concern the average Joe Soap after he finished making Roger & Me. The result was the award winning TV NATION and this book talks about the shows and what they did. Here are some of things they got up too.<br />* Love night for the KKK - Moore goes around with minority groups to KKK meetings.<br />* The invasion of Greenwich Beach, Connecticut - The locals have hired security to keep people off this beach other than themselves.<br />* Payback - Setting off car alarms outside of a major car alarm manufacturer's house. Calling up the boss's of telemarketers all day long etc.<br />* Crackers - The corporate crime fighter chicken that goes around American exposing corporate crime.<br />* Getting CEOs to see if they know anything about the products they sell - Can they roll a cigarette?<br />* Brian Anthony - A black American who has been arrested and questioned hundreds of times even though he has a totally clean record.<br />* Black Vs White Taxi stopping - Who will the driver pick up? The black or the white guy?<br />* Kentucky Slaves! - In 1995 Kentucky decided to abolish slavery.<br />* 1.5 Million Lock-ups and growing - what to do when you are the one in eight sent to prison.<br />* Selling your country - How to band together and sell your country over to the next one and get rich quick.<br />* Solicitation - How Junk Mail works and what kind of can WE send to people around America.<br />* Corporate Sabotage - How to get even the REAL way.<br />* Yuri the KGB spy - who because he does not have a job after the Cold War goes working for Mike instead in America. Missions include - Who is buried in Nixon's grave.<br />* Flint Nukes - Mike goes to Russia in search of the Nuke that was targeted on his home town.<br />* Communism Across America - Mike buys a big truck, paints it red with a hammer and sickle and has it driven across America to see what will happen.<br />* Serial Killer Neighbours - White? Male? How much can you really get away with? Why not EXPERIMENT and see!<br />* Cobb County - How much tax money does that place get and for what?<br />* Peace in Bosnia - How Mike got the heads of the warring factions to sing Barney songs... I love you... you love me..<br />* Lobby Congress - for $5,000 Mike manages to buy a new congress bill calling for August 16th, 1994 to be known as TV NATION day... and gets it!<br />Mike then talks about what was CENSORED from the TV nation shows and why, including spots featuring anti-abortionists threatening to kill people. Following this interview two abortion clinic workers where murdered by an anti-abortionist who probably prefers the old days of $5 backstreet coat hanger jobs. The Savings and Loans scandal was never aired because most of the rich where never convicted. The story about a young boy who turns up at the funeral of AIDS victims with a big sign that say - God Hates Fags, was also cut from the series. They where not allowed to air segments on condoms nor where they allowed to recreate the LA riots like we do Civil War enactments nor where they actually allowed to reveal that CUBA has better MEDICAL CARE than America.<br />This is great fun and informative read. If you can get the series on DVD or VHS then it makes it the even more enjoyable. This is a great Moore book with the usual witty lines every paragraph or so. Certainly one for the Moore collection and it maybe even be a little better than Stupid White Men.int Nukes - Mike goes to Russia in search of the Nuke that was targeted on his home town.<BR>* Communism Across America - Mike buys a big truck, paints it red with a hammer and sickle and has it driven across America to see what will happen.<BR>* Serial Killer Neighbours - White?

Michael Moore is the kind of guy that is directly identified by the right as some sort of a traitor and you can tell the people who misunderstand him or have not listened to anything he says because they never seem to realize that Moore is talking about parts of the US government and the rich fat cats who don't CARE ABOUT YOU and NOT about American citizens in general, except to point out some problems in society and show how some major issues could be resolved easily if we gutted a couple of fat cats and fried a few members of Congress. To be honest we all know he is not too far off the mark on these things. That is why we listen to this guy. With SWM, Moore builds on his policy making book - Downsize This! by targeting bigger fish... like the President of the United States of America - W.<br />The first thing you should know about SWM is that the publishers refused to release the book after 911 and that the British version has some stuff censored (I can not find the uncensored material though. Mike says it is around. If you find it on the internet post it here or mail me), so you get to read all about that in the book's introduction. Right away though Moore attacks W. Bush with how he stole the election. He then writes him a Chapter called Dear George and tears the man apart. He talks about the poor wages of airline pilots, brings the problem of racism to light in what is the most respectable and thought provoking chapter in the book. He then talks about the idiots in the White House and why they are idiots, gives us the stats of global and environmentally problems that are here now and how Bush doesn't care about ANY OF THEM. He then does a fun chapter on how men should chill out and let women run the world for a change, exposes the prison system in America, talks about the decline of interest in politics in general (says that Americans are 100% smart - just listen to them recite sports facts all day long - and we just need to make politics more like sport) and then gives us a people's prayer to send all those bad guys to hell.<br />SWM is not Moore's best book and certainly some parts can drag on but the man has something important to say on every page and I feel sorry for people who think this guy is actually saying that American people are the problem when all he is pointing out is that most of your tax dollar keeps you a slave and gives somebody more money to build YET ANOTHER NUCLEAR WEAPON while people go poor on the street. All of this stuff is worth reading, even if Moore does bend the facts or goes too quick for the jugular, because it deals with YOU, YOUR LIFE and the LIFE OF YOUR FAMILY. Every value he talks about in this book is critical to human development and he just points out how crooked politicians stifle our progress so that they can line their own pockets.<br />Vote this man for President!!! Send Bush on that journey to mars project instead (more money for bigger rockets).hen gives us a people's prayer to send all those bad guys to hell.<br />SWM is not Moore's best book and certainly some parts can drag on but the man has something important to say on every page and I feel sorry for people who think this guy is actually saying that American people are the problem when all he is pointing out is that most of your tax dollar keeps you a slave and gives somebody more money to build YET ANOTHER NUCLEAR WEAPON while people go poor on the street.

Moore's first book is actually his political policy disguised as a very funny liberal rant about all things corporate and crooked in America. If you want to learn more about what kind of policies Mike wants then this 1996 rage on the page is where it is at. For the critics who say that Moore is all about himself, this book proves them wrong. This is one that is certainly not much about Moore at all. I found barely two or three pages in it about Moore. This is about 90's corporate America. An important read for what was to follow in 2001.<br />\\"Downsize This\\" is probably not the easiest of Moore's books to follow because it is a little dated and centres on mostly America corrupt personalities who are unknown to the rest of the world... actually according to Moore they are pretty much unknown to Americans also which is really the case that the book wants to lay down - so Moore sets out to expose \\"Downsizers\\" (corporations that slash jobs at the height of their profits just to make more money). It is called GREED and Mike does one big expose on all of that (we are talking about corporations that are given massive government tax breaks ... your money... and then, when they are at their richest, slaughter the jobs of those who gave them the money in the first place by moving to some 3rd World Country to make EVEN MORE MONEY in places that have really bad human rights records). All that coverage is first rate material like his documentary Roger &amp; Me. If you liked that documentary then you will like this.<br />Then he shows how some politicians will take and cash checks from any sponsor (Moore even sends a check from a satanic cult to Pat Buchanan to see if the politician will cash it... and he does!). Moore lays it all down to Congress (this book should be mandatory Political Science literature) with 2 horse Presidential elections and the candidates which are mostly artificial corporate creations - demands voting for - working class INDEPENDANTS instead - To lobby for a stop in the massive tax welfare breaks that corporations get (the government gives them millions) for things like office parties while the poor go hungry - Companies have blown whopping stacks of cash (The Orange Country Crash) getting the tax payer to PAY IT ALL BACK FOR THEM - the next time South-Central LA wants to riot they should just travel up that road a bit further and trash Beverly Hills instead of their own yards! (He even draws them a map) - or how about the old German tourists and their retired relatives that are being murdered in Florida as payback for the Holocaust (yikes!!) To be honest he goes a little over the top at times with that chapter but Moore makes some decent points like - Why where the Holocaust survivors not given back considerable parts of Germany and how politicians may have endorsed the Middle Eastern conflicts with the move to Israel. I would not however say that Moore gives a good history lesson there by any means but the questions raised are good ones to ask.<br />He gives a lot of pages to Clinton saying how Bill could have been a miracle for America but messed it up badly and shows how. Then we get several pages of corporate crook trading cards. The Unions are not left unscathed. Moore calls them the most stupid people in society for letting corporate America get away with so much right under their noses. The best part of the book though is when Mike uncovers how prisons are been built in places where workers have been fired (downsizing) because the crime rate in that area goes up with unemployment. Guess what the prisoners are doing in the prison for labour? Doing the same job before they where fired for only 5% of the pay! Moore talks about abortion issues and women's rights. An interesting rant if you take the time to remember that we do not want to go back to the old days of $10 coat hanger back alley surgery. Moore has a bash at the military industrial complex with the failures in Cuba and the lost cloud the weapons makerswhere in when the Soviet Union didn't want to play anymore. He then goes on to tell us that O.J is innocent (lists some very interesting facts) but does not really convince us in the end - however he does get the point across - it is not really about O.J but the corruption of the LA police that is more shocking. He then talks about mentally ill members of congress and how he has actually tried to have them committed to psychiatric hospitals. These are just the facts.<br />Moore then proceeds to harass Bob Dole about his war-injured hand that he hides in public. This chapter does not make much sense but yet again Dole has been bought out by the various lobby groups and has pretty much voted against a number of policies that would have made the average American life better in favour of brown envelopes under the table. To Moore's credit he calls on Mandela to help end apartheid in America and makes a good case for it given that there are some incredibly scandalous statistics with infant mortality rates in certain parts of America when compared to Africa. Mike ends his book by setting out various policies that he would like to see put into action as soon as possible and asks everyone to help him help the average man by trying to do A,B,C,D...<br />Again this is not the best Moore book for those who followed in the wake of Bowling for Columbine but if you really want to know what's up with corporate America, \\"Downsize This\\" is mandatory reading... especially for politicians.s where in when the Soviet Union didn't want to play anymore.

From 1991 to 1994 Nick Pope was posted as the British MOD investigator of UFOs. That means he worked for the Ministry Of Defense. Pope believes that UFOs are real and explains what he discovered while working for the MOD. Although a lot of the information here is known to most UFO researchers he does uncover some new UK material. This is a good book about UFOs from an MOD insider. A worthy addition to any UFO book collection.
I really have to take this man's words with a grain of salt as I personally believe that his hypnotism and regression techniques are somewhat dangerous and certainly suggestive. I believe that only medical doctors should be allowed to carry out these very psychologically stressful procedures and here he conjures up all sorts of totally bizzare stories. Not that I believe that UFOs or Aliens are imaginary things, in fact I believe there is good evidense for them, but Hopkins &quot;may&quot; be influencing these people and that is certainly the most logical and scientific explaination for what is going on. This could all very well be the result of that yellow brick road to fantasy.<br />Have a bag of salt beside you when reading this one.
From 1991 to 1994 Nick Pope was posted as the British MOD investigator of UFOs. That means he worked for the Ministry Of Defense. Pope believes that UFOs are real and explains what he discovered while working for the MOD in his book &quot;Open Skies, Closed Minds&quot;. Although a lot of the information in that book is known to most UFO researchers he does uncover some new UK material and it is a good book about UFOs from an MOD insider. A worthy addition to any UFO book collection.<br />In this book he goes into detail about what he learned about Alien Abductions while working for the MOD on this topic. So it is pretty much as good an insider look at the MODs take on this whole issue as you will likely find anywhere.
Not my cup of tea for a UFO book. This one is mostly about psychic channelling and has stories about some people coming from the stars to save us. Not really my cup of tea for a UFO book but some of you out there might like this sort of thing.
This is a great book, a modern classic, but I have some reserves about it, namely the actual monster which is pretty much just derived from the \\"Return of the King\\" in a certain lair and Pennywise the clown is not frightening enough. So in terms of scares this book is not really the scariest King novel, in fact far from it, but then again IT tries to be more than just a horror novel and this is where it works best.<br />IT is actually best described as a \\"coming of age\\" book about a group of young adolescence who are bound by one common dominator - IT and how this thing has infected their town and their lives. The story is told in \\"Stand By Me\\" fashion, moving between various timelines in the past and the future as the gang remember their past and the horror that lurked in the sewers of their home town. So what you get is multiple characters, fully fleshed out and this bonding which is along the lines of \\"Let's kill the beast and save the day\\".<br />IT was actually written by cocaine fuelled Stephen King in his early days and even he admits that this one just appeared next his typewriter by the time he sobered up and it reads like it to. This book is massive and very thick but that does not mean it rambles on. There is a lot of substance to the story and the character development is first rate for this kind of literature. I recommend IT to teenagers especially because the story of friendship is a powerful one and adults will like it just as much as homage to their youth.<br />In short you can not go too far wrong with IT but remember you will be reading this book for the long haul but the pace is somewhat good. It is a unique book for its kind but again I have reserves about just how scary it really is. It is scary enough but not as much as it could have been and the actual monsters in this book are little bit undernourished in the frights department.
The Tommyknockers is best described as an interesting book about the unknown, specifically alien artefacts, but also happens to be a bit of a let down in certain departments, namely the conclusion and some plot development that goes a bit stray. The Tommyknockers is certainly his most original work and is a cross between \\"Invasion of the Body Snatchers\\" and  \\"Salem's Lot\\".<br />Basically a woman discovers a crashed UFO in the woods, digs it up, becomes hyper-intelligent and this \\"alien virus\\" spreads to others in the town who find themselves up to all sorts of good and bad things in very peculiar ways.<br />When all is said and done the characters are interesting and it has its moments as you would expect from this author, but ultimately it is a bit of a letdown and doesn't really finish quite like it started. King has done better but then again a lot of other authors have done worse. This is only really for the King lover. Go elsewhere if you want a good King book.
This book is probably not only an indictment of Japanese Human Biological Experiments but a condemnation of a US military industrial system that allowed the perpetrators to escape as long as the data fell into US hands and not the Soviets.<br />Basically before WWII the Japanese where world leaders in military medicine and during the Manchurian invasion took Chinese POWs to death camps for medical experimentation to advance science under the guidance of Professor Ishii Shiro, one of the most respected members of the Japanese medical community. The experiments were deemed so advantageous and necessary that the Japanese military built fortresses entirely devoted to human experimentation and bacteria stockpiling. This involved injecting a rat with a bacteria and then allowing a flea in a jar to feed on the rat. By creating stockpiles of infected fleas they would then design bombs to drop the fleas into towns and cities, but not before they experimented on POWs first. One experiment involved arranging POWs tied to crosses in circles in a field and then detonating the infected flea bombs in the centre to see how far the fleas could travel before infecting the host. <br />One of the most documented human experiment programs took place in a location called \\"Ping Fang\\" and included surgical work done on POWs not under anaesthetics, freezing POWs for frostbite tests and infecting POWs with Cholera, Epidemic Hemorrhagic Fever and THE PLAGUE all of which this book ties to the Japanese civil sector and the government under the control of a special branch called Unit 731.<br />This book even describes Japanese attempts at launching biological attacks on America and how after America took control of the Japans the whole thing was kept quiet so that the US military could get hold of the data as part of its Cold War. The second half of this important book is devoted entirely to witness testimony and confessions. The Japanese or US government have never admitted to these war crimesbut the evidence is now available for everyone to see. Many of the death camps and human experimentation factories are still standing today. This is a pocket sized book, but an essential read. My only critic is that it does not contain some of the more famous photographs of Unit 731 in action.<br />This is an essential history lesson that is still a holocaust in denial.
Hancock basically joins the dots to bring us a number of clues that suggest that at some stage the crust on the Earth suddenly moved causing some land masses to go underwater and others to appear from out of the water. The land masses then went down contained human societies that we owe part of our heritage too. He backs up his case with old maps that seem to represent some sort of a lost world. His book then moves along developing data on this incident and how it happened and want went down.<br />When all is said and done you feel that Hancock has a case that is not easily dismissed but not easily proven either. Geology may agree with some things that Hancock has to say and disagree with others. Archeologists accept that it is highly plausible that we are missing gaps in our time-line that are hard to explain and that catastrophes certainly do happen. So what you get a mixed bag, but nothing that we should slam but at the same time nothing that we should be rewriting history with. What it does do is say that much more research of the artic should be done and certainly we should keep an open mind on sudden shifts in the Earth's crust. Even the skeptics can not truly get science to ditch this one and the unorthodox scientists have a hard time pushing it.<br />It does however make for an interesting read and certainly you would not be wasting your time with it. Heck, you just might even raise your IQ a few points.
Hairy Hominoids and Big Foot, Giant Fish and Loch Ness Monsters, Gigantic Birds and other strange creatures - Science Screams \\"Neigh!!, Evolution has made them extinct!\\" but this book is what proves science wrong. In fact Darwin once believed that in order for evolution to work these relics of the past should be with us today, but he never could prove it. Then in 1938, Marjorie Courtney-Latimer, a museum curator, discovered an odd looking fish on board a trawling boat in South Africa... a fish that was thought extinct for 400 MILLION YEARS!<br />Could it be that this Coelacanth was nothing more than an artefact of evolution fished up from the depths of some frozen suspended animation? When science searched for populations of this fish it suddenly appeared in the Comoros and then later on near Java. Not only had they found a living fossil but they had also found what could prove to be the missing link.<br />The Coelacanth, because of its structure is a very good candidate for a fish that could eventually walk on land. Its fins even look like legs. Not only was the Coelacanth a good candidate for reptiles and mammals but as the precursor to mankind and here man holds the Coelacanth in his arms!<br />The book however is not really about crytozoology. It is all about the Coelacanth, its discovery by Marjorie Courtney-Latimer in 1938, the science and pursuit of the fish that followed as Professor J.L.B Smith sought to find more specimens. The politics of international law and science trying to find and acquire the first live Coelacanth and the subsequent analysis of the Coelacanth underwater in late 20th century by new wave submersibles.<br />\\"A Fish Caught in Time\\" reads like a great adventure story and is a must for anybody looking for a very interesting topic with some red hot escapades to boot. The characters in the search span some 60 years and are all fully fleshed out. It is Coelacanths, Coelacanths and more Coelacanths along the way.<br />This is a mandatory read for anyone even remotely interested in evolution. It speaks volumes about what science has yet to learn and how many of its 20th century evolutionary claims are in fact clearly wrong and the real scientists are those who the extra mile in the face of blunt reason and logic.<br />A wonderful book!

You can get this one from David Icke. He has a good few of them in stock. Basically it is a little gem of book designed around the notion that humans are really alien intergallatic do-gooders but some have lost their path and done all sorts of wrong things on way because of the birth process. So ET 101 tries to set the record straight on what Mission Control really wanted you to do.<br />It is a fun book full or morals and good virtues. It is quite funny at times and does have a cult following.<br />Highly Recommended.
The book is huge and heavy. Every single page has at least several great color photographs and it is a big book. You will love to read about ILM's ventures into the digital realm. It is very technology orientated, but not too much and does talk about the film making process and ILM in general. This is well worth looking at especially for fans of ILM or those who want to see what goes on behind the scenes or for those looking for a career in this direction. This is a good place for inspiration.<br />Although it does not cover the more recent movies you will still get the picture here. It starts by talking about go-motion and then moves onto the first ever digital sequence and how much people slaved over it before going into detail with the evolution of that process and of the special edition of Star Wars and Speilberg's &quot;J. Park&quot;.<br />The book looks fantastic. Keep it for your grandkids. I am sure they will love you for it. This is the kind of book that you will turn to time and time again just to see &quot;how they did that&quot;.
A Brief History of Time (ABHOT) has been with me since its first publication. I now feel, after nearly 20 years of it as a passive hobby, to be able to comprehend and explain what it means to me. It is a deeply personal voyage that I am most glad to have undertaken.<br /><br />Firstly to call this just a science book, a view I once held, is an understatement. It is both a scientific presentation and the exposure of the corruption of minds that submit completely to a mystery answer for mystery questions. You cannot separate the two in this book. They are interlinked by ABHOT's critic of the persistence of some members of mankind to maintain a wanton lack of knowledge.<br /><br />This armchair sufficiency in a mystery answer must be combated at all costs in order for us to stop denying that we possess a large brain. If we invoke the mystery explanation as the answer for anything then God just might as well have finished with the spinal cord which would have been enough for us. We are faced with the facts. Creation happened and we want to know how. Hawking knows how.<br /><br />Since this books deals specifically with theological questions and scientific ones it would be best to start with the theology problems posed by Hawking (the word God appears 40 times). Hawking claims that in 1981, at the end of a conference on cosmology organized by the Jesuits in the Vatican that they \\"...were granted an audience with the Pope. He told us that it was all right to study the evolution of the universe after the big bang, but we should not inquire into the big bang itself because that was the moment of Creation and therefore the work of God.\\" Whether the Pope said this or not is up for debate (the Pope has made official declarations on this matter and they do not feature this element of non-inquiry) but Hawking thinks he knows how this God went about his business. The book builds up to the explanation of the universe starting with this critic of the Church in Chapter 8 - Origins and Fate of the Universe, which describes the history of time as we know it and gives the Church a nudge in the process.<br /><br />It is obvious that Hawking, strictly using the scientific method, describes the history of time without invoking God or a mystery. Hawking shows us that he knows things about how creation came about and that at no point is an intelligence being used to describe the cosmos. This veil, he believes, was removed long ago with Copernicus, Kepler, Galileo, Newton, Einstein and now once more by himself.<br /><br />This is not the first time the Catholic Church is featured in the book. It has a historical relationship with cosmology and a pretty poor one when it comes to Galileo who effectively ended the dark ages by reviving Greek mathematics and physics with an obvious fact that the heaven's change. The Church simply got this badly wrong whatever way you try to cut it (how can God's representatives get it so badly wrong?). The Earth is not the centre of universe. How does the Catholic Church keep their claim to God's representative on Earth if other people are explaining creation without recourse to a mystery? Hawking gives you problem equation that the Church is now dealing with. That equation is... the more we explain things, the less there is for God to do. God = ?<br /><br />Now we get down to the brass tacks after finishing with this quick lesson about a major negative in theology. How does Hawking know there is less for God to do in his model of the universe? The answer is in the laws that exist and that remain unbroken. Things are the way they are. If God created the universe, he did it this way, the one we observe, the one with laws he doesn't break.<br /><br />According to Hawking if we know what these laws are then we understand everything there is about how the universe governs itself. This means predicting what it will do. So how do they do that? How do these men of science come up with such outstanding prophecies! Probably the best way to go about ABHOT is to break it down into easy to understand sections.<br /><br />Contrary to book blurbs, even though this is made for the layman, you can't do it with just this book alone unless you have a background in studying physics. Intense study over the period of several months, years even, as was my case, may be required.<br /><br />The original came with an introduction by Carl Sagan. It is not here.<br /><br />Chapter 1 - Our Picture of the Universe<br /><br />This chapter is easy to understand. It deals with the history of mankind's perception of the universe and gives special note to the Catholic Church's dealings with Copernicus and Galileo. In short the net result is that Churches tell us how to get to heaven while scientists tell us how the heavens work. The Earth actually goes around the sun.<br /><br />Chapter 2 - Space and Time<br /><br />Quickly combining Newtonian Gravity with Einstein's relativity we are given examples of spacetime models to explain the speed of light, how time can dilate, light cones and the geometry of spacetime according to relativity (imagine a rubber mesh with balls creating dips in the mesh that in turn create contours, called geodesics, for objects to follow naturally). Mass grips space by telling it how to curve, space grips mass by telling it how to move.*<br /><br />*If this Chapter does not make sense then read \\"Introducing Newton and Classical Physics\\" by William Rankin for Newtonian Physics and \\"Introducing Relativity\\" by Bruce Bassett.<br /><br />Chapter 3 - The Expanding Universe<br /><br />Astronomical observations by Hubble (has the telescope named after him) prove that the universe is expanding which means at one time in the past it was all together. Penzias and Wilson in 1965 discovered background radiation noise from the big bang. Friedman's projected model of the universe is analysed and Hawking introduces three outcomes where two expands forever and one collapses in eventually, from a big bang to a big crunch.<br /><br />Chapter 4 - The Uncertainty Principle<br /><br />This chapter quickly covers three important scientific experiments (blackbody radiation, photoelectric effect and the double-slit experiment problem) that led to the development of Quantum Mechanics and the uncertainty principle that the process of measuring particles on the quantum scale can alter some their attributes*.<br /><br />*While this chapter can be understood somewhat on its own, it is terribly short.

Relativity and quantum mechanics are not unified by the model presented by Hawking (gravity is not unified with the strong or electroweak force). Thus relativity describes macro events, while Quantum Mechanics describes subatomic particle events.<br /><br />Chapter 6 - Black Holes<br /><br />Hawking describes the history of Black Holes, what they are and how they advanced our understanding of quantum mechanics and relativity. Keywords are John Wheeler, Chandrasekhar, Oppenheimer and Cygus X-1.<br /><br />Chapter 7 - Black Holes Ain't So Black<br /><br />Hawking describes the dynamics of the black hole incorporating quantum mechanics. This section is why Chapter 5 needs to be understood very well.<br /><br />Chapter 8 - The Origin and Fate of the Universe<br /><br />This is the big description of how we came to be from the beginnings up until now with the predicted future of the universe which is described as a finite without boundary model. Keywords are Gamow, inflation and Guth.<br /><br />Chapter 9 - The Arrow ofTime<br /><br />This is amazing. Here Hawking answers the question about Entropy and why the macro universe is gravitating towards disorder in the system it is in. Call an apple order and imagine all the possibilities of a disordered apple. There are much more possibilities of disorder than order. However since our universe was ordered according to the big bang event then the disorder model when collapsed backwards reveals events becoming more ordered as they return to their original state.*<br /><br />*This chapter excludes how systems can become more ordered in systems that are not closed such as our planet which did not generate or destroy energy or change the balance of energy in the universe because the energy used in our evolution was transformed finally into heat which leaves the planet and goes back into the universe.<br /><br />Chapter 10 - Wormholes and Time Travel<br /><br />This chapter did not appear in the original edition.

Consult Galileo on attempts to show them how it worked.<br /><br />Hawking is obviously the best explanation for creation since the writers of Genesis redacted the creation account from the Enuma Elish somewhere over 2200 years ago.<br /><br />Living at the end of the 20th century meant being privy to facts that no one else had understood before.

Consult Galileo on attempts to show them how it worked. <br /> <br />Hawking is obviously the best explanation for creation since the writers of Genesis redacted the creation account from the Enuma Elish somewhere over 2200 years ago.  <br /> <br />Living at the end of the 20th century meant being privy to facts that no one else had understood before. I only got it in the 21st. Why settle for anything less than the truth? <br /> <br />Thank you Mr. Hawking for explaining creation like no one else has done before.
This is the historically true account of the execution of the Templars and the political circumstances surrounding it. If you have read books about the Salem Witch Trials then you will like this one too, but be warned Barber is a historian and so you will get the full blow by blow account of what went on.<br />Basically in the year 1307 King Philip 4th arrested the Knights of the Templars and a pseudo-trial followed in order to smash the Templars. Much like the Salem Witch Trials many where falsely executed while others survived the ordeal to tell the tale. Basically this book is all about the destruction of the Templars.<br />Again if you like books about &quot;Witch Trials&quot; then this is a must for the bookshelf and certainly Barber gives us the best historical rendition of any &quot;Witch Trial&quot; to date although the Templars where not treated as Witches but as anti-christian (when is fact they where a &quot;White Order&quot;).<br />Good historical depth to this one and highly recommended.
This is really the book that got the whole &quot;Tesla is a UFO whizz-kid&quot; going and MANY of the other books out there owe it to non-other than Commander-X for the expose and getting their minds going. Truth be told that this book is 50% complete fiction, 25% semi-accurate and 25% accurate.<br />However it is still a must read! You will love it! It talks about Tesla as if he was an alien and then expands on that. As a work of fiction and some half-truths it goes down a treat. I recommend this book on the bases that you also read something more mainstream and vetted for accuracy or even books written by the man himself.<br />You will still love this book though. I know a lot of it is bunk but I still find myself sitting on the loo flicking through the pages now and again for a good laugh. The real fun is finding out what is true and what is not by doing your own research or reading other books.<br />This is great stuff.
This man is a genius! In Food of the Gods, McKenna postulates that monkeys on a diet of mushrooms, or dipping for insects in mushrooms, ate psychoactive chemicals that eventually played a major part in the evolution of human consciousness.<br />He then goes on to examine mushroom spores and there ability to leave the planet and travel intergalacticly in deep space frozen hibernation before landing on another planet. He describes the mushroom as the perfect vehicle for intergalactic travel and the spreading of consciousness.<br />SPACE MUSHROOMS!<br />The rest of the book is all about mankind's evolution with psychoactive plants by his side. Although he did get some things wrong in this book it was still cutting edge for its time and remains one of the most important thoughts on the topic to date. The world will also miss the man after his recently passing into that higher realm of consciousness.<br />Take this trip with Terence McKenna and expand your IQ.
Some notes on this book;<br />*You can read this book in a few days.*<br />*You can skip some of the psedu-quasi-religion on your first reading but it is easy stuff if you do not rush it.*<br />*Hollywood made it into a film so it can not be that hard*<br />*Christian Slater even managed to get it.*<br />*Try reading \\"The Tibetan Book of the Dead by W.Y.Evans-Wentz\\" if you think this is hard.*<br />The Name of the Rose is quite complex in its initial appearance which according to the author is a work of non-fiction derived from an old manuscript written by a monk called Abo of Melk that Umberto Eco has translated for all the world to see and read. It is a 13th century tale of this monk's youth spent as an apprentice to an ex-inquisitor, Brother William of Baskerville, who has been asked by an abbot to uncover the truth behind a rather disturbing murder at his beloved abbey. The story is quick to adopt an investigative posture which not only involves all the hallmarks of a \\"whodunit\\" type story but also has Abo, and many other characters, questioning their own faith and the faith of others.<br />The story is much more than just another detective yarn as Umberto Eco continues to depict scenes of spiritual debates, holy disorder, political corruption, religious rebellion, crimes of heresy and sexual misconduct which are as a contradictory to the life of a monk as the murderous crimes themselves.<br />There is much in this book to dissuade many from reading it in its entirety. The Name of the Rose is often cited as the \\"bestseller that has never been read.\\" There is much truth to this as I myself have often found that certain passages and lengthy debates would make one nod off as if listening to a sermon that carries with it a haze of sleepiness. No doubt many of the monks in this story have felt the same way too. There are many versus in Latin and references to historical religious figures that have no direct impact on the story but are only dished up to help Abo, and the reader, derive conclusions to many of the questions found in the mind of a novice that are philosophical and metaphysical in nature. You have these questions too.<br />The Name of the Rose expounds on the correlations between order and chaos, much of which is linked directly to William's own ethics when carrying out his investigation of the abbey.<br />It is a hard book to read or follow because of its many Latin references, pseudo-religious-philosophical debates (there is not too much of it though) but is as equally a hard book to forget or stop reading. No doubt without the \\"whodunit\\" elements this book would more suitable as special treatise hidden among the abbey's own Aedificium. Very few books leave you feeling somewhat attached to the story but The Name of the Rose ushers with it a very subtle relationship between you and William who acts as a farther type figure to Abo who is your eyes and ears in the story. Needless to say the actual impact of the book does not hit home until the final three or four pages. Everything else beforehand has been of interest to you but you don't quite know why. The book actually ends up posing more questions than it attempts to answer and this in itself is what is at the heart of The Name of the Rose. The final vestibule of assertion is made only in saying that nothing can be confirmed at all and good men should not seek to hold fast to Earthly possessions which eventually return to that from which they came. . . . including this story.<br />You will read it again and that is why it is a keeper. Don't even bother looking for it in the library. Just buy it, appreciate it, take your time with it and raise your IQ.ader, derive conclusions to many of the questions found in the mind of a novice that are philosophical and metaphysical in nature.

Heart of Darkness by Conrad is a very short novella that is masterfully descriptive of its characters and locations but also happens to be incredibly uneventful and surprisingly lifeless for a book that attempts to bring us a unique vision of an Africa-come-trade fair.<br />In short, this journey into the heart of darkness should have been a little more engaging but just happens to pass from one page to next without any drama, suspense, intrigue or mystery. Sure Conrad can describe his locations, characters and their thoughts beautifully when he renders them onto the page but this novella just misses anything that might interest us, leaving each descriptive paragraph marred by dislocated reasons for being there at all. There are areas of this jungle that scream to be penetrated but are alas forgotten about or just left behind. As a story it also fails to stay coherent at the best of the times and even after repeat readings makes little or no sense.<br />Conrad is leaving much up to our imagination but also frankly leaves gaps too big to be considered a structured plot. It is more like the ramblings of a drunken old sea worthy fool who between swigs of the ale forgets why he was talking in the first place, but at least continues along in a descriptive babbling that helps you make it to the last page.<br />In short this story would have been better told by someone else who was there. It seems like the writer is struggling at the best of times to want to write it which probably explains its length as a novella. I am sure Conrad just got this one over and done with so that he could move onto a better piece of literature. It seems like a completed piece of work just for the sake of completing it.<br />It is no wonder that many students will nod off during this one. You can not blame their youth for this snooze-fest. It is plain and simply boring and there is much better period novels out there that deal with similar themes. I am sure swapping this one for something from Patrick O'Brian \\"Master and Commander\\" would make the class room more attentive.Patrick O'Brian \\"Master and Commander\\" would make the class room more attentive.
Not only can you see the words, but you can smell paragraphs, feel the sentences and taste the chapters. William S. Burroughs has managed to cheat the structure of the English language by flat-out denying the existence of orthodoxy, tradition, convention, rules, principles and standards to deliver a fresh 1950s account of what it is to be a free person, although albeit with the paradox of equally being hooked on every conceivable vice.<br />Burroughs treats character development, plot and structure as mere formalities that have no place on the page. To him the essence of writing is to convey an idea of an experience by any means necessary. This is inclusive of coining new words, new grammar and new syntax as long it gets the message across. In many ways Burroughs achieves the expression of his deranged take on the human condition, and the inhuman one, by simply never coming to terms with life as anything more than psychotic mayhem with the assumption that being \\"correct\\" is with population numbers that concur with one another on the trivial points of livelihood. To him it is all pandemonium whatever way you try to cook it and since disorder and chaos are the meal of day why not just dine on it like a King's banquet.<br />The premise here is non-existent. It simply delves into some sort of a junkie come spy come homosexual cover operative who travels to a place called the Interzone to write daily reports of his experiences there. The narrative is fresh, bold, thoroughly unique and actually interesting. It is inspiring but any attempt at trying to do a genre like it can only be seen as plagiarism. Not only has Burroughs cornered his market here, but he owns it through and through. There is nothing else like Naked Lunch and there probably never will be.<br />This book was so shocking when first published that it was tried under obscenity laws. By today's standards the work is quite heartening but is still thoroughly deranged material. It is evil because it is destabilizing on the reader who is brought to a resounding crunch as their mind leaves all rational thought behind. At that moment anything can happen. Let's just hope that the reader can tell the difference between fiction and fantasy before it is too late.

Learn how to become a movie mogul, get laid every hour, do cocaine by the second and eventually die on the toilet just like the \\"King\\" himself. Truth be told it is a terrible thought that this best-selling Hollywood expose book is based on a dead man written shortly after his death. It's a fair topic - a tab bit tasteless - but fair, because when you are a multi-million dollar figure in Hollywood who has spent money and time on the latest fashion, fast cars, diets and diamonds to get your face into Variety press, then when things come tumbling down, or you go the way of the dodo, you can't expect writers like Charles Fleming to look the other way - and Fleming certainly does not!<br />This book is cruel. It does nothing for Simpson or his family and friends. If you know the man well or have been close to him then this is nothing more than despicable tabloid trash. However the rest of the world may not see it that way. We have an interest. How did the most powerful movie producer in Hollywood live? What made him tick? What did he eat for breakfast and what do people really think about him? Fleming is able to give us an angle, although it is an extremely limited one. It seems that anybody who had a good thing to say about this man just shut up and didn't want to talk to Fleming during his research. Unfortunately, the end result is that the only people who wanted to talk are those who didn't like Simpson much and Fleming's rendition of this producers life is marred almost by a secular group, who... well... to put to bluntly... hated the man's guts.<br />So this book ends up being pure sleaze with a big capitol \\"S\\". Fleming for life of him is trying to tell the reader something along the lines of  - \\"Look, I am trying to find the man's good side, really, truly I am, but there are just so many people who hate the guy and want to say something that I just can not avoid them, really I can't.\\" and then to break the monotony of all the bad press he is giving to Simpson, Fleming manages to find a  hooker who says - \\"Gee, he was a sweet man who paid me well in bed.\\" or some burnt out junky who says - \\"Simpson, oh yeah (sniff) that dude (sniff) we had a really crazy time together (sniff) and he was really nice to people who had powder (sniff).\\"<br />As soon as Fleming hears the words - Cruise, Gere, Smith, Murphy, Schwarzenegger, Gibson, Stallone, Willis, Johnson he is off like the wind to find out what is there. To be honest this book takes no prisoners and if you are involved in the industry then Fleming is going to give you a Royal shafting with cheese.... extra CHEESE.<br />When all is said and done, and you feel like you have read more Sleaze than all of the editions of National Enquirer put together, you might actually discover that Fleming has a moral to his story - that the life of Don Simpson, although a successful one, is a lesson to learn for all who venture down the path of excess. It is not a bad lesson to learn, however out of millions upon millions of readers who have scanned these pages, maybe one or two will ever get close to touching the royal robes and certainly it is odds on favorite that they will just be made cannon fodder for the mysterious monsters that haunt Fleming's world of fame.<br />This is swill with cream on top... but its still swill... however, it is excellent swill at that. So gobble up your swill and have your fill. When you are sick with yourself afterwards maybe you should pay more attention to that which you are eating and using, or you might end up like our friend here. How ironic this book turns out to be.

It is not hard to see why. Harris has spent much time on writing this one and in the hands of the right editor this book is nothing short of expertly published. Not only does it stand out as a very important development in the world of literature and the art of writing but it is also a great story to boot. There is not one page, not one sentence, not one word that has not been looked at or mulled over by the author. You can tell by reading it that this book has been in development for probably something close to a decade. Every paragraph reads like a paragraph that has never been made before. Every clich&eacute;d driven plot, character and dialogue has been skilfully avoided. The descriptions are on top form and the book delivers on all counts.<br />First of all this is horror. This is not a murder mystery. Harris has thrown aside any preconceived ideas about what this sequel is going to be like and it pays off in aces. He could easily have given us ANOTHER Silence of the Lambs but what is the point to that? Instead this is a book about Hannibal... a cannibal.... a cannibal who is a man called Hannibal. That many figures from Silence of the Lambs are back here is only incidental to the fact that Hannibal knows them. The book is entirely based on his life following his escape from the asylum in Lambs and the life he has chosen to lead.<br />Hannibal is really the most extreme anti-hero character ever conceived. He is the pivotal character in the story, not Agent Starling!, and it is through him that we experience the world of Hannibal. This book is about just that and then some more. Here we learn what made Hannibal a cannibal and why he is what he is. That should be enough to get anyone who is even remotely interested in Lambs to read this book.<br />The premise to this story is a simple one. One of Hannibal's victims, a Mason Verger, has survived his attack and for years lies bedridden with his appalling injuries as he abuses little children. He has also hired some bounty hunters to track down Hannibal and will pay them whatever it costs because of his silver spoon heritage. Agent Starling discovers the plot to kidnap Hannibal and tries to get him for herself by way of deception. It is all out action and psychological horror from start to finish with a great ending too.<br />This is all about Hannibal and fans will love it. Just do not go into it expecting the same as what you got before. This is horror through and through.<br />**As a note avoid the movie which is very different and has a terrible Hollywood ending**y hunters to track down Hannibal and will pay them whatever it costs because of his silver spoon heritage.

Yes its time again for the Moore bashers to come out in their legions of ten or twelve people with over four hundred amazon usernames each and battle away with the many here without ever reading a single page of the man's work because the world they live in would rather see Moore swinging from a tree with mass censorship enforce up and down the country than somebody to maybe say huh?.. aren't the people of the United States a little different than the administrators that run the country? Hell no, who could ever think of such a thing! Bush and Ashcroft are everyday Americans, other brothers in arms who would certainly let us share their bed in their nuke fallout shelters if they ever pressed the button for the big one. What they do, they do for us right? What they do is all about us and not the multi-trillion dollar military industrial complex that spends more money in the black budget on a toilet seat than they do putting food in the mouths of starving people or the homeless who need shelter or those in need of better conditions in the classroom or the environment. Hell no, these people are thinking about us and nothing else but us!<br />Most people who live in real world recognise what Moore is saying. Moore is a man who is able to put the fear of God into every single narrow-minded individual who walks the Earth. Here he tells you that most Americans feel that they are being attacked whenever a political policy issue is raised. For someone to come out and say that the US government is wrong is somehow made to sound exactly the same as \\"America-hater\\". This is a striking reality that only shows how much hijacking the American government has undertaken over its own people. How can it be that because some terrorists exploited a hole in US defence that suddenly this allows the US government to rip civil-liberties apart with things like the Patriot Act. Does it make sense that the US government should act to belittle its own people and make them mice in what appears tobe a tragic experiment in repression because its own DOD managed to make a boo-boo of epic proportions. Again the American people have been spanked by their own regime for its mistakes and those who dare question that should be labelled \\"communists\\", \\"lefties\\", \\"insane\\" and \\"anti-American\\". The single best thing that Americans have going for themselves is their ability to band together as one and move forward, but in the wrong hands that becomes a disaster that we have seen many times before as a horror called fascism that rises up from what people thought was something good but turned out to be something very evil.<br />The sad part is that even people like Moore can do very little to stop it. It will run its natural course and then those who supported it will find themselves trying to put the pieces back together in its wake. It is only after the fact that this will eventually connect with them and Moore does a wonderful job here of trying to explain that.<br />It is simply amazing that Moore can create such a commotion with such simple and basic understanding as this one. That says it all really.
To read some of the negative reviews here is enough to place this book as a very good prediction of the way things are to become with Americans in general. One aspect that this book expounds on is the way that the US government has been involved in redirecting its own citizen's anger in every other direction other than towards itself. The greatest ploy explained in this book is the tactic that the US government uses time and time again by saying that when someone attacks their views or policies that they are attacking the American people, while at the same time Ashcroft is involved in the biggest rollback of American civil liberties ever seen during any era that this world has gone through. It should be clear to most people without much logical deduction that the real hijacking is occurring on American shores by its own government. One recent development is the issue of weapons of mass destruction which have still not been found in Iraq. The people where told by their own President that the American-Hating Iraqi was going to bomb them with chemical weapons both here and abroad and yet when American forces where on the Iraqi doorstep not one chemical bomb was dropped or used against American forces while Eastern European armed forces stood on the sidelines of this war laughing and cashing in on just being there with their expensive and world leading mobile toxic and biological treatment technology that they got paid multi-millions for but never used. The term \\"anti-american\\" has been coined by President Bush and yet nobody understands what this means. If you are \\"anti-american\\" then what is it to be \\"pro-american\\"? So Americans automatically get that they should all be now pro-american and have walked into business meetings with European leaders to ask them the question if they are pro-american only to be met with gob smacking looks by a nation that has had it fair share of dictators running fascist ideologies like this one around the place. Now all Americans hate France and Germany even though 50% do not own a passport and think that this all about America saving the world from World War 2 and not getting the respect they deserve as if Pearl Harbor never happened and as if their great country would somehow be able to stop Hitler single handed when he had taken over the rest of the world. This is a good book which shows what happens when caution is thrown at the wind and the mindset of a population is dangerously close to becoming the dragon that it initially set out to fight.
The Siege of Trencher's Farm has now been re-released under the title Straw Dogs by Bloomssbury press in the UK, and it deserves it. The book is different to the film in many aspects. The story is about a mild-mannered writer, George Magruder who has moved into a farm house in the Cornish Village of Dando. During the winter a child murdering lunatic escapes an asylum and a village girl goes missing. The locals find out that the lunatic has been knocked down by Magruder's car and so try to break into Magruder's house to kill the lunatic who may have murdered the missing girl. Magruder fortifies his house and over the period of a few hours in transformed from a weak writer into a full blown homicidal maniac in an attempt to keep the villagers out of his home. The story is angry, violent and very often livid with hate. It was written in 1969 and is probably responsible for movies like The Evil Dead and many other films where people are trapped inside their home battling something foul outside. It is different from the film but is still a very good read if only a bit short (159 pages).
I also own a stack of other film encyclopedias but for weight and manageability this is the best of the lot. The book is around 2 inches thick - but is the size of a novel and you can hold it in one hand. It is a full resource (with over 18,000 titles!), easy to carry around and has a full listing of directors and cast at the back along with Oscar winners. Overall the reviews are not very good and they are limited to just four of five lines at best. I mostly do not use it for the reviews though. It is more of a \\"find a director or star that you like and quickly flick through the index and the corresponding works to see what else they have done\\". For that it is very impressive but if you are looking for in-depth reviews then you should go elsewhere for the more unmanageable volumes and Arnold Schwarzenner to help carry them around for you.
I am not such a fan of Ray Bradbury but his book Fahrenheit 451 is excellent and is now among modern classics in the same line as 1984 and Brave New World. Most new versions of this book carry with it a great introduction from Bradbury about how he typed his manuscript on a typewriter that cost 10 cents to use every half hour. The story was first published by Playboy magazine. Fahrenheit 451 is the temperature at which books burn.<br />Inspired by Hitler and Stalin book burning, 451 tells the futuristic tale of a fireman, Guy Montag, who works for the government as an emergency book burner that sets fires to books which have been banned. They storm houses, dig up floor boards, find books, destroy them and then arrest the owners.<br />Montag begins to question the controlling society that he lives in. Why is he burning books? Inevitably this leads him to seek out books for himself and with it the paranoia of being found out while working for such an oppressive regime. There is some very good plot twists and the story is full of tension, suspicion and mistrust.<br />You will read 451 in a day or two. It is less than 200 pages long and easy to get through. A modern classic that you should not miss.
This is the forth and final book in the Tibetan series from W.Y.Evans-Wentz. Although this book can be used as a stand-alone book it is certainly not best read that way. Basically this is part of a developing series. The first book in the Tibetan series - The Tibetan Book of the Dead, is the fundamental book of the series which describes Buddhist philosophy, psychology and metaphysics. It is the best translation out there and the original! The second book in the series is called Tibets Greatest Yogi Milarepa and is the story of a great yogi who puts into practice most of what we learn from The Tibetan Book of the Dead. It is through the story of Milarepa that we learn more about The Tibetan Book of the Dead. In the story of Milarepa the yogi studies the Seven Books of Wisdom of the Great Path as taught to him by his gurus. Tibetan Yoga and Secret Doctrines, the third book in the series, is an expansion that explains those wisdoms and describes the yoga that is used to achieve them.<br />The Tibetan Book of the Great Liberation is a three act book which ties together everything learned from the other three books. Essentially the start of the book develops a clearer understanding of the metaphysics associated with the first three books in the form of a general introduction. The book then lays out the premise for a type of yoga practice called the Supreme Path or Mahayana, that was created to serve as an INSTANT ENLIGHTENMENT yoga. It is mostly psychological. The middle section of the book is devoted to the guru Padma-Sambhava who brought this yoga to Buddhists in the eighth century. The latter part of the book expounds on that yoga in a full translation.<br />Make no mistake about it. This is the ORIGINAL and best work because this was the man who brought the work to the occident! These texts are ancient and old but have served millions since their inception. The work that Evans-Wentz has done here is substantial if not some of the most important Tibetan Buddhist concepts ever seen by the occident - all directly translated by master gurus whom which Dr. W.Y.Evans-Wentz was a student for years.<br />There is nothing wrong with the translation. Forget those who seek to play down the originals so that they can sell their new version. This book has stood the test of time. It was first published in 1954! The original book in the series was published in 1921! Evans-Wentz was in Tibet at the turn of the century learning under these gurus!

Most of the major yoga practices are covered in this book. Most new books on yoga are indebted to this mans work on the subject, all directly brought back from the orient by master gurus whom which Dr. W.Y.Evans-Wentz was a student for years.<br />There is lots of philosophy to go through and lots of text and this may put a lot of readers off, or those what to get straight into the practice but there is lots of philosophy and mental orientation to get right first. It is all here... all 434 pages of it! Mostly text! There is nothing else like it! The original is here!<br />*** The other books in the series are - The Tibetan Book of the dead and Tibets Greatest Yogi Milarepa - before this one. The final book in the series is The Tibetan Book of the Great Liberation. ***The other books in the series are - The Tibetan Book of the dead and Tibets Greatest Yogi Milarepa - before this one.

Wicked Beyond Belief by Michael Bolton is an expose of The Yorkshire Ripper through the eyes of the police and investigators who worked on this biggest manhunt in British History. Anyone aspiring to become a police officer or an investigator should read this book. It is crammed pack with investigative methods and forensic procedures. Not only was The Yorkshire Ripper one of the worlds most chilling mass murderers, but he got away with murdering and attacking women over a period that lasted ten years because of bad policing.<br />The case of The Yorkshire Ripper is a three act story. It is about a serial killer who brought the middle of England to a stand still at night, the citizens gripped in fear for years on end and afraid to go out alone. It is also equally, if not more so, about the establishment of a single Yorkshire police body that combined the talents of different police squads from the towns where the Ripper was at work. It is also about the mistakes that where made during the Rippers legal hearing which led to his convicted and \\"diminished responsibility\\" on the grounds of insanity.<br />The Yorkshire Ripper terrorized Leeds, Manchester, Brandford, Halifax and Huddersfield. He may have murdered more than thirteen women and attacked scores of others. The total number of murders and assaults will never been known. The Yorkshire Ripper picked up prostitutes, hit them with a hammer over the head and left them to die, or as in most cases - he mutilated their bodies using special killing instruments that he shaped from screwdrivers which he always drove around with. He did not take any souvenirs but he did mutilate the woman in a sexual way. This led many detectives working on the case to believe that he was mainly only interested in killing prostitutes and so a huge manhunt began which involved questioning prostitutes, setting up monitors in the red light districts and trying to trace a car that matched the killers tire prints. The Yorkshire Ripper was not long before he started to turn on teenage girls, female doctors, secretaries, school teachers and women walking home alone at night.<br />Trouble for the investigators was brewing since the beginning. The fact that the murders had taken place over various different police jurisdictions meant that the crimes where not linked until at least three women where murdered, but there was also scores of other near-fatal attacks that where never connected. They had the killers name already in their database of suspects to go through and several photofits of the suspect from witnesses. The Yorkshire Rippers car was also on a list of another 140,000 vehicles to be checked. Later as the evidence against the Ripper began to mount up they eventually zeroed in on their man on no less than seven different occasions. Unfortunately bad management and organization in the incident room left the prime suspects file go unnoticed for years. Hundreds of thousands of homes, vehicles and businesses where searched and suspects vetted.  A punters £5 became the center of the enquiry and a letter and voice tape recording from the Ripper drove a media blitz upon the people of Yorkshire. LOOK AT HIS HANDWRITING! LISTEN TO HIS VOICE!<br />Read about detectives cracking under the stress and having heart attacks - learn what new victims emerged after the trial - listen to detectives talk about their conversations with the Ripper during routine interviews before he was captured - read about how his friends fingered him out to the investigators only to be ignored - Learn about the never-mentioned-before \\"KILLING UNIFORM\\" that the Ripper wore while stalking his pray. Read about how this demonic device never found its way into the courtroom as damning evidence which suggested that the Rippers claims of insanity where a hoax and that he planned his sexual murders meticulously.<br />The book is slow to start because it goes into a lot of detail about the areas where the attacks took place and the investigators, including their family background. So it is very slow to start, but around 250 pages in it really starts to get cracking. There is still much that the detectives on the case are not talking about and the Yorkshire Ripper himself has also told a lot of lies. However the end of the book does give the whole chain of events from the Rippers own mouth so you get that side of the story too. Overall a very good book but it is long slog to get through the detectives backgrounds before the case begins.s, including their family background.

The only reason why I have this book, which is mostly hardcore Hinduism, is because of reading - The Tibetan Book of the Dead by W.Y.Evans-Wentz which is essentially Buddhism. In that book, and especially his follow-up books (Tibetan Yoga and Secret Doctrines), Evans-Wentz makes reference to The Serpent Power in many of his footnotes. There are also introductions by Sir John Woodroffe (Arthur Avalon) in the books of Evans-Wentz. There are aspects of Buddhism and Hinduism that are intertwined. Hinduism is more like Christianity, in that it uses deities and faith to help one understand much of that which it espouses on. Buddhism is more psychological and metaphysical. That is why Evans-Wentz books have all introductions by Jung.<br />One of the main points of interest that has been adopted by Buddhism are the chakra, which are better known as - The Psychic Centers. There are seven of these centers in the human body. They are connected and are mostly psychological. Evans-Wentz does a good job of explaining these Psychic Centers in his own books but if you really want to see where Buddhist chakra developed from then no look further than the master book on the topic - The Serpent Power.<br />Now a word of warning. Hinduism is nothing like Buddhism or Christianity and this book is a world away from most Buddhist literature. It is heavy on Sanskrit and is certainly tough reading. However this whole book is a secret doctrine about the chakra, the psychic centers and Kundalini yoga. That doctrine is also called - The Description of the Six Chakras and the Five-fold footstool. There is 300 pages of an introduction and then the entire translation of that doctrine.<br />Those who wish to find out more about Kundalini Yoga or the Chakra may be advised to check out the works of W.Y.Evans-Wentz first before moving on to this more complex topic. It is presented in the manner of Hinduism and is certainly tough going - however the goal is attainable right here within these pages.
This is the second book in the Tibetan series from W.Y.Evans-Wentz. If you really want to begin at the start then you should first of all read - The Tibetan Book of the Dead by the same author. Milarepa is essentially the 800 year old story of Tibets greatist yogi told through the eyes of his students Jetsun and Rechung. The story is about a poor wicked boy who eventually turns into a wise old yogi to be held in the highest esteem. It is a wonderful story that can be read as a standalone book or as part of the series.<br />The most important aspect of this book is that it Milarepa, as a student of Buddhism, needs to practice and cover much of the topics that are explained in The Tibetan Book of the Dead. This is really what is at the heart of the book. So those of you who may want to learn more about The Tibetan Book of the Dead (and you should because it is one of the most important works ever obtained by occident man), can see it put into practice in the story of Milarepa.<br />There are many footnotes and references for you to read through. Again the story is a wonderful, uplifting one with lots of joy and sorrow to experience. You will certainly gain much metaphysical insight and the morals in this story when put into practice will certainly make you a better person. It is a wonderful journey and I have read the story many times and will read it many more. It really is that spiritually enlightening and certainly a very important text to be translated in English for the occident. This book is a treasure-house of spiritual information.<br />The other two works in the series are - Tibetan Yoga and Secret Doctrines and The Tibetan Book of the Great Liberation in that order.
The Warren Report is the basic starting point for anybody who is even remotely interested in researching the JFK assassination. The book is massive - nearly 2 inches thick, 9 inches in length and 6 inches in width and clocks in at 888 pages. There are many illustrations and photographs to help break the monotony and they are helpful in understanding the text.<br />Be forewarned. This report is not to be taken at face value. It promotes itself while at the same time laying blame on everybody from Oswald to the Secret Service and the Dallas County Police. You have every right to be critical of this book because of its omissions. One of the most important pieces of evidence - the autopsy photographs - have been completely omitted. Not because they would serve as only disturbing the American people and the Kennedy family but because they where deliberately HOAXED when revealed to the public through the media. There is no excuse for providing the American people with autopsy photographs of another dead man who was not President Kennedy. The original autopsy photographs have since come to light and these shed new information on the case. The report does not even touch on that topic. These photographs alone should warrant deep consideration by the even the most hardened lone-gunman supporters. How can the Warren Report expound on the wrongness of the Dallas Police revealing inaccurate case information when itself is staying shut-mouthed on the deliberately hoaxed autopsy photographs? This kind of hypocrisy is mind shattering and only serves to drive home the most important item of interest of the whole affair - that the US government is knowingly and deliberately hiding evidence and information to protect some interest. You must read more elsewhere to learn the full facts of the case and the other host of omissions that where deliberately kept aside from this report.<br />The warren commission report starts with its summary and conclusions - that Oswald acted alone in killing President Kennedy and that there was no conspiracy. It then gives a brief synopsis of the assassination and the circumstances surrounding the events on November 22nd 1963. The report continues by developing the scenario in the Texas School Book Depository including the evidence gained from witnesses at the scene and the recovery of the riffle, spent shells and prints. Connections are established between Oswald and the riffle and the School Book Depository building before moving on to the motive and Oswalds background.<br />The report then deals with Oswalds detention, the media, Oswalds murder and his assassin - Jack Ruby. The next chapter deals with investigating a possible conspiracy before laying out Oswalds background in detail. Next up the Warren report deals with the protection of the President and concludes the entire events on page 468. The remainder of the book goes in-depth with expert witness testimony with several recommendations and more background on Oswald.<br />In the end you are left feeling that Oswald was involved in the assassination one way or another and certainly the slaying of Officer J.D Tippit by Oswald is the clincher. The murder of patrolman Tippit is a key event which shows that Oswald was capable of murder and was also on a killing frenzy at the time of the assassination. He also tried to shoot officers when he was apprehended in the film theatre. Did Oswald shoot President Kennedy? Probably Yes. Could the Magic bullet theory work? It is possible. Did Jack Ruby kill Oswald on the spur of the moment? The facts surrounding this are vague. Did Oswald act alone? It is possible but unlikely. Does the Warren report do justice for the American people and the people of the world? Absolutely not. Does the Warren report deliberately neglect important and relevant information? Absolutely. Would an impartial jury convict Oswald on the assassination of President Kennedy based on the evidence? Probably not because there is too much doubt at largeto deal with. Would an impartial jury convict Oswald of the murder J.D Tippit? Yes. Is there a cover-up and if so why?<br />The truth is that there is probably a cover-up involved and the Warren report as it stands today is absolute proof that the US government at the time was knee-deep in a conspiracy of some kind simply based on its omissions and neglect to deal with highly important and relevant evidence. Was there a government conspiracy to assassinate the President? Probably not, but there was a cover-up of a conspiracy of some kind and this is what is at the heart of the whole assassination and the follow up events including this report. A blind eye has probably been turned to the truth surrounding the assassination because President Kennedy was considered an obstacle to many important people. In fact the Warren Commission report has all the hallmarks of a new administration that just wants to sweep everything under the carpet.<br />All in all this is a five star book, not because of the quality of the report, but because its contents when compared to what we now know only serve as a reminder that even the administrators of what is supposed to be a leading democratic and free nation can act in such a wreckful and manipulative manner.<br />In short Oswald was definitely firing shots from the Dallas School Book Depository building. He owned the gun that shot at the president. He murdered a police officer and tried to kill more. He also tried to assassinate Maj. Gen. Edwin A. Walker but failed. The chances that Oswald was the only one firing shots at President Kennedy that fateful day in Dallas are slim. When you add an extra shooter the whole thing falls into place. To quote Occams Razor - When explaining a thing, no more assumptions should be made than are necessary.<br />Magic Bullet vs more than one assassin? -  The extra assassin is simply the more logical conclusion easily.to deal with.

This is extraordinarily terrifying non-fiction. First off all I can safely say that many would find themselves better off not reading this book if they are of a nervous disposition. It is extremely serious in tone and probably one of the most compelling dissertations on the phenomena of ghosts, spirits and demons that I have come across. This is not your casual, &quot;I saw a ghost floating across a room in a haunted house&quot; or &quot;I felt a cold spot in my bedroom and watched a glowing orb&quot; type ghost book. It is more along the lines of &quot;This entity was ripping my living room to shreds, writing obscene messages on the walls and appearing behind me as a disfigured monk with no eyes who then proceeded to attack me while my family screamed in terror as they huddled together on the staircase.&quot;<br />I was really unsure of what I was getting myself into here. I heard that this book had a cult following and that Stephen King basically calls it his best book of reference. I was aware that this book was about two &quot;ghost hunters&quot; - Ed and Lorraine Warren and covers some of their research, spanning some 60 years, along with various case studies. What I did not know is that this book actually makes a valid statement on the entire issue of haunted houses, ghosts and demons and even goes into elaborate explanations for these phenomena. Truth be told I have read some highly professional books on this very topic before. Here is a word of advice. If you are seriously interested in learning more about the Occult then read &quot;The Tibetan Book of the Dead&quot; by W.Y.Evans-Wentz. It has forward by Jung. It is an ancient Tibetan Holy book that elaborates on and explains many different types of psychic phenomena but the book is not classed as such. It is a religious/psychological book about Tibetan Buddhism but it clarifies a lot about the supernatural. So I was well armed going into this one with at least a little more knowledge on the subject that your average reader.<br />The first thing that struck me was the authenticity of what I was reading. There are many books on this topic that would make me laugh or at least see another logical reason for what was going on. &quot;The Demonologist&quot; is having none of that. It is straightforward - here is another world, YOUR WORLD, where demons actually exist creating misery for peoples lives. Everything is explained in relentless detail without sparing the readers unease about such a topic. The book moves between cases of demonic disturbances (incorrectly referred to as Poltergeist activity according to the author) and the lives of the two researchers/demonologists Ed and Lorraine Warren. Most of the book is done in an interview fashion with Ed and Lorraine answering many questions and telling several stories about their many encounters with the diabolical. One story, about a family called the Donovans, will blow your mind. The case is also illustrated with photographs of demonic activity in progress. There is also transcripts of conversations with ghosts and demons from tape recordings.<br />Ed and Lorraine Warren are not &quot;ghost hunters&quot; per se. Ed actually uses religious strategies and holy objects to establish and combat the very physical presence of an &quot;inhuman&quot; spirit that is usually violent and on the offensive. Lorraine uses her sixth sense to establish connections with &quot;human&quot; spirits that are passive and inoffensive and are just looking for resolution to their misery. The book mostly concentrates on the malevolent &quot;inhuman&quot; type.<br />There is also something tremendously otherworldly about the book itself as if it carries with it some sort of direct connection to the Warrens experiences. &quot;Potent&quot; would be the best word to describe it. I am telling you right now in an honest manner, do not go near this book if you think you will be uncomfortable about the subject matter. The mildest parts of this book are utterly mind shattering and the more disturbing elements will deliver instant insomnia with unfeigned paranoia by the truckload. Only for the hardened spiritual explorers who can deal with the &quot;demon shock&quot; - The Exorcist is kindergarten in comparison.<br />**As a note there is apparently a problem with the US edition which has been heavily edited and is missing pictures. The UNCUT edition is available from the UK. I went the extra mile and got the UNCUT version but I have not seen the US edition so I can not say with certainty that this is the case except that other reviewers too have pointed out that the US edition is cut. Get it from Amazon UK if you want the UNCUT version like I did.**<br />My only critic about this book is the pictures. Please reprint them as quality standard middle section pictures next time! The resolution was not the best - however, like the rest of the book, they certainly are unsettling.terly mind shattering and the more disturbing elements will deliver instant insomnia with unfeigned paranoia by the truckload.

This is an autobiography from Bruce Campbell that is mostly about himself but contains huge amounts of important tips and tricks for the budding filmmaker and actor. In his younger years Bruce Campbell used to make Super 8mm movies with his friends - one of whom was Sam Raimi, who later went on to direct the box office smash \\"Spiderman\\". Before Spiderman, Bruce and Sam where spending most of their time trying to make it as movie producers/actors/directors and were reasonably successful with works like \\"The Evil Dead\\" series. Bruce painfully, and I stress painfully, recounts how hard it is to make it in the film industry. I was actually quite surprised to learn that Bruce did everything from cab driving to security guard work just to support himself as an actor - even midway through his career which already had a low budget smash hit and over two dozen pictures with his name on it.<br />What this book offers is lots of authenticity. Bruce is not an actor who wants to \\"shoot the bull\\" with his reader. Instead he just scribes away at the raw ins and outs of his life as an actor/director/producer and recounts his rise from boyhood prankster to B movie star which includes its fair share of bit-part sitcom paychecks and \\"hey is that the guy in the used-car dealer commercial?\\"<br />All in all people love Bruce Campbell because he comes across in his work as someone who seems to be having a cracking good time and wants you to enjoy yourself too. That same talent is reproduced in this book but be warned - many of you \\"Campbellites\\" will have to put up with the fact that Bruce does not just concentrate on one part of his career, or film - nor does he go into massive detail on some of his more obscure projects for the die hard-core fan. What he does do is go through everything, giving ample-campbell details on the making of The Evil Dead and the Hercules television series. I wanted more on The Evil Dead and even though the DVD of the series has running commentaries, I hope that Campbell/Raimi and Tapert conjure up some book solely devoted to that topic alone.<br />The book is stuffed with original pictures and there is plenty of laughter to be had between the pages. The new edition of this book has an extra chapter on the book tour which rounds up with many of the characters that Campbell spent time with throughout his career.<br />All in all this is an excellent insiders guide to the man himself, acting, Hollywood and making it on your own steam. If you read books about film stars, movie making and Hollywood then get this at all costs! Fans could not ask for more....<br />.... but we will..... encore!t Campbell/Raimi and Tapert conjure up some book solely devoted to that topic alone.<br />The book is stuffed with original pictures and there is plenty of laughter to be had between the pages.

Rosemarys Baby is extremely easy to read and you will get through the book in no time at all. It is short, about 200 pages and is pretty much more of a novella than a full bloodied horror manuscript. None the less - it is still extremely satisfying and the size and depth of the story is particularly suitable for the subject matter at hand.<br />The plot revolves around the newly wed Rosemary and Guy Woodhouse who have moved into a huge apartment in a building known as the Bramford in New York. Rosemary wants children and Guy, an actor, wants to further his career. Hutch, a friend of Rosemary, tells her that the Bramford is a \\"danger zone\\" because of previous murders, suicides and diabolical deeds that have gone on there in the past. Sure enough many of these atrocities slowly begin to unveil themselves much to the dismay of Rosemary. Guy sees these events as just a coincidence and the elderly occupants who live in the Bramford seem to be all too innocent to be involved in plotting murders or faking suicides.<br />Eventually everything settles down and Rosemary gets pregnant during a nightmare that has her confused but she gradually calms down to prepare for her new born but not without the smothering attention of her neighbors who pop around twenty times a day to help her out. Rosemary casually begins to notice things in the Bramford or about its occupants in passing and slowly suspicion begins to develop in her mind that all may not be as it seems.<br />There is a classic mystery lurking behind the more horrific avenues found in this great story as Rosemary slowly unravels the unknown which seems to have a diabolical nature. Doctors hint that her pregnancy may be causing undue stress and the reader is left guessing right up until the last few pages as to if there is a plot to sacrifice her baby or if she is going mad in some sort of prenatal depression. The ending is a total shock to the uninformed reader!<br />Roman Polanski also directed the film version of this book. Both the film and book are excellent choices of entertainment.<br />Highly recommended original horror!book.

The Stand is not for the King novice by any means and remains his most inaccessible work - but it is a modern masterpiece in every sense of the word. If you have not read King before then stay clear until you get a few under your belt because this is a very different book but it is probably his best. The Stand when first released was a publishers nightmare who felt that the book needed to be cut in order to make it more appealing to the market. It was a book that could have been a big turnoff point for his readership but the edits where made and the book was well received by the critics. With this version King has reintroduced the cut elements to restore this classic to its full entirety. It is a massive book (1168 pages!) and a huge undertaking by King. I read this while I was in hospital and that is the best place to read it because of the subject matter. So buy it and keep it aside for those gloomy days in the ward with tubes hanging out of you.<br />Essentially this is an apocalypse story that revolves around a terrible man-made virus that wipes out most of the planet leaving but a few survivors who must restore mankind by taking a STAND either with the good guys or the bad guys led by Lucifer - Randall Flagg. It is vast in characters with detailed locations and lots of plot. The first half of the book concentrates on the different characters and their various predicaments before the virus is unleashed. Then they gradually meet up throughout the course of the story, some falling victim to the dark side, others leading the survivors to good for a final standoff between the two factions.<br />All in all this is just salami literature (good guys vs bad guys stuff), but what tasty salami it is. This is a full blooded manuscript, rich in every aspect with plenty of scares along the way. A modern apocalypse classic that still works well today and possibly predicts the fate of mankind in a very eerie way. It all seems too real at times!<br />Timeless.<br />- As note this is one of Kings few books where a main character, Randall Flagg, makes a second appearance in another unrelated novel called \\"Eyes of the Dragon\\". You may want to dip into that one first before you read this as it is a sort of prequel for this main character.is is one of Kings few books where a main character, Randall Flagg, makes a second appearance in another unrelated novel called \\"Eyes of the Dragon\\".

This is the original \\"Tibetan Book of the Dead\\". All other versions are a toned-down version of this work by different authors who want to accommodate people who do not want to put the work in. You need to put the work in. No one can spoon-feed this kind of wisdom to you.<br />The Tibetan Book of the Dead is an extremely authoritative translation of the original texts of the \\"Bardo Thodol\\" by Lama Kazi Dawa-Samdup who schooled W.Y.Evans-Wentz in Tibetan Buddhism. The book is an extremely important piece of work for both the scholars of psychology and religion, and the lay person who has the time to spend working on it. The book is also the reality behind the \\"Necronomicon\\" which has been popularized by fiction writers, such a H.P.Lovecraft, but has been completely taken out of its true context.<br />To begin with, this book is a beautiful book once you truly understand the message that it is trying to convey to the reader - or more correctly, when the reader correctly understands the message that is being conveyed. It has a primordial air to it and is certainly ancient in its wisdom and understanding. The book was translated in the early 1900s and was first published in 1927. Be warned - this book is exceptionally difficult to read because the standard of grammar used is of the highest acumen humanly possibly. Evans-Wentz was a Doctor of Literature, a Doctor of Science and a Master of Arts. If you don't have a full size Oxford dictionary, then you will have trouble reading it. There is also a difficulty in the translation. There are many Tibetan words that do not exist in English so Evans-Wentz sometimes derives a more descriptive meaning behind the message that is trying to be communicated to the reader. Dr. C.G. Jung has written an introduction at the start of the book which is mostly concerned about explaining the Tibetan meaning of the words \\"Soul\\" and \\"Mind\\". It is for reasons like these that the book requires multiple readings to fully absorb the information that is being presented. So what exactly is The Tibetan Book of the Dead? It is a corpus with several teachings. Tibetan Buddhist monks believe that if you understand the meaning of death then you will understand the meaning the life. It expounds in detail on the illusions of the human mind and gives a context for working out many questions that are philosophical and spiritual in nature.<br />The book is essentially split into three parts. The first part has introductions from various students of theology, psychology and Buddhism. Evans-Wentz then explains the nature of the book and gives a rough breakdown of what we will find in the \\"Bardo Thodol\\" and how it is used to help the dead find their way to Nirvana during the after-death ceremonies (like an Irish wake) but also how the book can be used as a guide for the living, which is its true intended purpose. The middle part of the book is the \\"Bardo Thodol\\" translated directly into English and third part covers the topic of Buddhism in general with references to the different schools of thought and Christianity.<br />The middle part of the book, the actual \\"Bardo Thodol\\", is split into three parts. There is an introduction at the start which explains the entry into the \\"Chikhai Bardo\\", the first of the Bardo regions that one automatically enters at the point of death. Then there is the second phase of the \\"Bardo Thodol\\", the \\"Chonyid Bardo\\" before the final phase of the \\"Bardo Thodol\\" the \\"Sidpa Bardo\\". Essentially these three areas can be explained as - the moment of death and the dawning of the light or nirvana, the karmic illusions of worldly things and finally the rebirth process. However do not think that this means that everybody is reborn or that Tibetans/Buddhists take reincarnation literally. It is all part of a thinking puzzle. You have got to work out things for yourself. There are hidden meanings in there. You must compare the different concepts in this book to find out what it really means! Question the\\"Bardo Thodol\\". Question what it teaches! Question what it says about itself!<br />The Bardo Thodol is a technical and thoroughly scientific examination of consciousness that is still highly regarded as one of the most logical and controlled methods of understanding the mind and its relation to the world of phenomena. At first glance the book may seem horrid, uncanny and evoke a fear by the mere mention of the word \\"death\\", but this is a book about the living, dedicated to life and expounds on some of the most important questions that man can ask himself. It is extremely satisfying and worthy of repetitive readings.

They should be read in the following order - (1)The Tibetan Book of the Dead, (2) Tibet's Great Yogi Milarepa, (3)Tibetan Yoga and Secret Doctrines and (4)The Tibetan Book of the Great Liberation.)
I would recommend this book on the bases that if you want to get into film making then you should see how this guy went about doing it. It is not a bad book but is a bit technically challanged. For instance the writer has a huge section on building your own editing suite for actually cutting the film by hand. This may be good for some film makers but you will certainly get better results if you meet up with an actual editor who will cut your film for you while you sit by his side.<br />The book basically tells you what you need to get up and started and how to go about shooting your first film on a low budget. This book is pretty much written in a &quot;One-man-band&quot; sort of fashion and although it is possible to make a film this way you would do a lot better by actually meeting up with people who know a little bit about film making too - probably in a film school or weekend course. Anyhow, lots of helpful hints and tips but you will need other books to supplement this one and you will need a bit more help from experienced film makers (even amateur ones) to help you on your way.
Basically this book is a three part book. The start of the book goes into the film making process, what it is about, why bother and how to get started. It gives you a general air of what is going on before a film starts shooting.<br />The middle part of the book is extremely technically useful. Don't be put-off by the fact that it is a British book, most of the standards are the same and the writer covers both US systems and UK systems. Anyway the value of this book is in that the writer interviews very important people that work in the filming process - actors, special effects, film lab, cameramen, editors, sound editors, legal agencies, projectionists, marketing people, producers, directors... etc.... and they all give very profesional tips on what you should do and what you should NOT do.<br />The third part of the book deals with CASE STUDIES and various filmmakers talk about their projects and what went right and what went wrong (My copy of the book is actually missing pages here. It looks like the printer left out about 30 pages and replaced these with pages that where already printed a few pages back before).<br />Overall this is a very good book with lots of information from the people that matter in this industry. There is a lot of information on what NOT to do when shooting your first film. Anybody who wants to get into to film making should not miss out on this writer/director's account of his experiences with film making. It is worth every penny, even though my book did have misprints.
This is a very good book about Rene Dahinden who has since past away. Rene was the ultimate bigfoot hunter but one who should be respected because even though Rene spent most of his adult life in search of the creature he never found it. In fact Rene never claimed that bigfoot was real or that it existed at all. He was just interested in learning what he could.<br />Rene came to Canada from Switzerland in the 50's. He was one of the organizers behind the Harrison Hot Springs B.C. Centennial celebrations in which he started a monster hunter competition for the elusive creature.<br />It is a remarkable story about someone who turned up lots of new things sasquatch related but never once saw a bigfoot himself. His story revolves around his work with John Green and his failling out with the same man. Rene is one of the first sasquatch hunters to investigate the Bluff Creek footprints and was responsible for the release of the famous Patterson bigfoot film. He also worked closely with Russian bigfoot researchers and brought many of their findings to the west. This was an extremely important development in bigfoot research.<br />This is a very good book about Rene and his hunt for the sasquatch with lots of chapters that relate to the above. It is pretty much told in a way that doesn't try to push the idea that Sasquatch is real! and you will learn a lot about the history of sasquatch and how it all began right here within these pages.<br />This book is an excellent start to anyone who wants a good take on the whole bigfoot saga.
This is a great UFO story, about a man, his wife and children in Gulf Breeze, Florida. Ed Walters claimed that he was hounded by a UFO near his home that even tried to beam him up. Basically the book is about Ed Walters taking photographs of a mysterious UFO outside of his home and then publishing them in the local newspaper. He writes about his experiences photographing the UFO and the MUFON investigation that followed shortly afterwards, during which time he took more UFO photographs and eventually published them in this book. So basically the book is about a series of extraterrestrial events near the Walters household in Gulf Breeze, Ed Walters taking photographs of this UFO and the MUFON investigation that followed.<br />So how does the story pan out? Well it is pretty much the bees knees of UFO sightings. The book is full of color pictures of a mysterious UFO with portholes at the sides which seems to be flying everywhere around Ed's home. It seems pretty believable and even has statements on photographic analysis from Dr. Bruce Maccabee to authenticate the photographs. Bud Hopkins, the famous alien abduction memory retrieval expert, even chimes in. So as a true story UFO romp it certainly is very good... except...<br />All the pictures are indeed fake. In fact this story destroyed the MUFON outfit which split because of two groups that came out of it, Pro-Ed Walters and Anti-Ed Walters. Dr. Maccabee was paid $20,000 for his analysis to appear in the book before the investigation was over. What you also don't know is that Ed Walters has never released his photographs for analysis elsewhere and that he holds the copyright to all the photographs that he took AND the ones that he said he did not take. The other photographs where published in newspapers elsewhere, so he had anonymous witnesses to the events. The big blow to Ed's story came when he denied taking these other photographs but a quick search found that he had copyrighted them. Also anomalies associated with talking photographs against a piece of glass using reflection methods of fakery cropped up in these photographs as well as his own. The anomalies where originally called scratches and blotches due to the development process and the camera he was using, but this is false, and since all the photographs have them then they where taken with the same camera and the same fakery process. Ed is in fact the photographer of the anonymous photographs that appeared in the newspapers after he had taken his and since he owns their copyright it pretty much goes to show that Ed has lied about his story.<br />I believe that there was a UFO FLAP over Gulf Breeze and that many people did see UFOs in the sky but this book is a complete hoax that just capitalized on the whole event. Ed Walters has simply faked a ton of photographs during this UFO flap and sold them off as what people where seeing. This is in fact false. Ed and his wife where the only people to ever witness this type of UFO. No one else saw this UFO and there are no witnesses to back up their claims, even though Ed lives in a pretty densely populated area. People may have seen UFOs at Gulf Breeze, but they didn't see the UFO in the pictures that Ed took.with talking photographs against a piece of glass using reflection methods of fakery cropped up in these photographs as well as his own.

Also known as \\"The Cinematographers Bible\\", this thick hand-sized pocket book is an absolute must for anybody who owns or uses a 16mm, Super 16mm, 35mm, Super 35mm or 70mm motion picture camera (movie cameras). IT WILL NOT TEACH YOU CINEMATOGRAPHY! It is a technical manual to be used when shooting on film and has since become the industry standard book that most amateur and professional cinematographers own and use. Motion pictures cameras are also built around the specifications laid down in this book.<br />Essentially the first 100 pages deal with all the different types of motion picture cameras, their internal mechanisms, technical details and threading paths. Then the book goes on to dealing with motion picture film itself, the various brands that are available, differences between black and white, color and a bit about the development process of each one. Again, technically detailed. There is also very valuable charts on film lengths and running times according to fps. The lens section is very technical covering the different types of lenses and the most important focal length, distance to subject, measuring charts that is really the most widely used part of this book. There is a massive section on filters, exposure and emulsion testing.<br />The book then deals with lighting and covers the various aspects of lighting types, bulbs, filters and exposure techniques, all highly technical in nature with references to charts and illustrations. The book ends with a coverage of visual special effects that can be done with the motion picture camera and other special techniques that the cinematographer will need to know about.<br />You will need this book if you are shooting on film, end of story. If you are looking for a manual that teaches cinematography then choose CINEMATOGRAPHY by Kris Malkiewicz instead. As a note, there is a lot of new digital cinematography cameras on the up and coming that work on digital video tape and not film and many new filmmakers may be advised to check out this route as a cheaper and less costly way of shooting their first film.advised to check out this route as a cheaper and less costly way of shooting their first film.
This is an excellent book about all things horror, but is mostly concerned about books and movies. I got this book after flicking through the pages in the local bookstore and was taken aback by the wonderful layout and colorful images of what Clive Barker has to tell us about the world of horror. It is completely illustrated from start to finish and has lots of art work from Barker himself and there is plenty to read about in between images and pictures of all things diabolical.<br />Essentially the book donates a few pages to each letter of the alphabet like \\"M\\" is for \\"Murder\\" and then Barker starts ranting about that topic in as many of its different forms as he sees fit - however the book is primarily written by Stephen Jones, but there is plenty of Barker inside. There is lots and lots of references to artists, writers, actors, filmmakers, makeup artists and directors. Barker also talks about real life horror with such topics as Ed Gein the serial killer.<br />I would highly recommend this volume of work to anyone who wants to know more about horror. By flicking through the pages they will come across lots and lots of things that they would probably like to know more about. Whenever I am thinking about buying a horror movie or a horror novel I always turn to this guide to see what Barker or Jones recommend. As a horror writer Barker is into the whole scene and is never short of coming up with something interesting that you might like to know more about.<br />This is highly recommended companion guide to all things horror. The book is really well designed and you will find yourself turning to it time and time again.
Before you get &quot;American Cinematographer Manual&quot; which is a technical manual for shooting on film you will probably want to start with something that explains the ins and out of the motion picture camera and how to shoot on film. This book does just that.<br />Essentially the book deals with all the different formats of motion picture cameras, their internal mechanisms and threading paths. Then the book goes on to dealing with motion picture film itself, the various brands that are available, differences between black and white, color, color reversal and negatives along with a bit about the development process of each one. It is not technically detailed, it just describes and illustrates each one so that you will understand more about them and how they are used. The book then deals with lenses and how to frame your shots and covers a good bit about exposure, fps, filters and lighting.<br />This is an excellent starters manual and will get you up and running with your motion picture camera in no time. However when you are shooting on film you will need something like the &quot;American Cinematographer Manual&quot; for technical details on focusing the lens, threading the type of camera you have and exposure adjustments for filters.<br />As a note, there is a lot of new digital cinematography cameras on the up and coming that work on digital video tape and not film and many new filmmakers may be advised to check out this route as a cheaper and less costly way of shooting their first film.
This is a pretty good UFO conspiracy book because the author has documented over fifty cases that are related to a strange underground base in Dulce, New Mexico that may or may not exist. It is pretty much the ultimate UFO/Government conspiracy book and the author is pretty much describing a type of &quot;Hell on Earth&quot; scenario for the future. It was written in 1999, before the millenium, and the author has all the hallmarks of an apocalypse writer.<br />The value of this book is that is covers a lot of stories from others people's work and tries to link them altogether in one volume. It is the only book that I know of which goes into detail with its description of the case of Phil Schneider who was found dead in his house after a lecture tour about secret bases.<br />I found this book helpful in that it brought my attention to other UFO cases that I knew nothing about and I was able to learn a little more about these elsewhere because of this book. It certainly is more of a 'horror' story than investigative reporting but again the value is in learning about stories that you have not heard about before.<br />This book certainly does not cover mainstream UFO events and is more geared towards government conspiracies, New World Order, Free Masons and all that kind of stuff. It appears to be orientated in the direction of demonology too - there is a ton of stuff and reptilians and lucifer. If you like David Icke then you will probably like this book. If you don't like David Icke then you will probably do well to keep away from it. It is written in the same kind of tone as the Commander-X series of books.<br />Again the value is in learning about new cases but be warned the author does sound to be in panic most of the time and thus lowers the authoritative nature of this book considerably.
The book was originally written in 1979 and for anyone who wants to know more about the Philadelphia Experiment, then this is precisely where you should start because this is the book that got the ball rolling. The Philadelphia Experiment tells the story of the governments attempt at optical and radar invisibility with a navy ship called the US Eldridge that resulted in a catastrophe but may have also uncovered a whole new area of physics - essentially warping space.<br />William L. Moore and Charles Berlitz simply go in search of the story behind the Eldridge which is based on a series of letters and notes sent by Carlos Miguele Allende in 1955 to a UFO writer called Morris K. Jessup after he published the first and original UFO book called \\"The Case for the UFO\\". Allende essentially told Jessup that he had been a navy officer who witnessed what happened to the US Eldridge as part of a government experiment on invisibility. He claimed that the project went wrong, men caught fire, went mad, some were embedded halfway into the deck of the ship and others phased in and out of this reality. Allende claimed that there was a link between this experiment and the technology behind UFOs. Jessup thought that Allende was a crank but after doing a little more research found that there was some background to his story and that it was worth investigating a little more. Eventually a number of Navy officers and commanders became interested in the story and decided to investigate it for themselves. In 1959, Jessup died under suspicious circumstances - dead in his car from carbon monoxide poisoning - and many believe that he was murdered.<br />Moore and Berlitz cover the entire original story of Jessup and Allende and expose various US military programs that are connected with the Philadelphia Experiment. The investigative reporting is extremely good and current Philadelphia Experiment writers and researchers have this book to thank for their endeavors.<br />Much more to the story has since been exposed but like anything you would do well to read this book to find out how it all started. Forget about the Montauk boys who claim to have been there when it happened. This is the book that you should start with first well before you even consider looking at the Montauk project.<br />This is a highly recommended piece of investigative journalism. You don't need to be a UFO buff either to enjoy it.has since been exposed but like anything you would do well to read this book to find out how it all started.

The movie was good but forget about connecting that flick to this book. This book was first written in 1975 - NEARLY 30 YEARS AGO! If you have ever read \\"true story\\" UFO books before, then you have probably come across a lot of recent material that seems more plausible like \\"The Gulf Breeze Sightings by Ed Walters\\" and \\"Fire in the Sky: The Walton Experience by Travis Walton\\" but both of these books have since had their day - they have been pretty much debunked and are widely known as absolute hoaxes, if not downright fabrications at best. After 30 years, The Mothman Prophecies is still a SOLID story because of the amount of witnesses to the events, biological medical evidence and the final catastrophe that ended the phenomena. The only case that debunkers have against this story is that the Mothman could be an owl or a large species of crane, but eyewitnesses deny that it is any such animal.<br />In fact the Mothman is not part of any category of cryptozoology. Much like the chupacabra, it is a zoological impossibility so the only possible realm of existence for this thing is genetic experimentation, an apparition or extraterrestrial. The latter category is what the Mothman falls into and this book is all about just that.<br /><br />Keel went to Point Pleasant West Virginia in 1966 and 1967 to investigate a series of unexplained happenings that the towns people where experiencing at the time. Most importantly was the sighting of a creature that could only be described as some sort of a flying monster. This creature, dubbed the Mothman, was new to Point Pleasant but not to the history books and so Keel went digging around to see what he could find. While doing this he unearthed an astonishing amount of information on this mythical beast. At the same time there was some UFO activity in the area and Keel was the one who made the connection between the Mothman and the UFOs.<br />Essentially \\"The Mothman Prophecies\\" is a book that documents and reports on a HUGE UFO FLAP in Point Pleasant, West Virginia. Coupled with this event where strange lights in the sky, encounters with the unknown, men in black, psychic phenomena, cattle mutilations and an impeding of Keels investigation by possible secret government agencies. Keel is only one of many people that where exposed to these events and although the book must be treated skeptically, it does open your mind because there is simply too much activity taking place to call it a hoax or work of fiction. Various people seemed to be attacked by the Mothman. Even an ambulance used for blood donation was chased and attacked by the thing. In short this is an excellent UFO book that still stands the test of time.<br />For years we have been waiting for its re-release and the movie has helped spur that along. When you compare this book to other true stories about UFOs you really begin to appreciate its value. I have read a lot of UFO books and books about strange encounters but this is the one that really got me gripped from start to finish. After reading this book it is very hard to see it as anything less than real and truthful. \\"Occam's Razor\\" tells us that in explaining a thing no more assumptions should be made than are necessary - but when applied to this book you must explain how everything occurred in this one region to so many people. Keel not only researches the Mothman but documents everything that happened at Point Pleasant during that fateful period of time.<br />It is a whopping story that is highly intriguing, absolutely baffling, horrific and extremely hard to dismiss as a work of fiction. It is not until you see the Mothman documentary that is on the movie DVD that you actually get to put faces to the people in this book and hear them talk about their experiences. This is first rate investigative reporting and an amazing story to boot that can't simply be dismissed as all in Keel's mind, or a hoax or fabrication. Strange things went on in Point Pleasant, West Virginia and the people where scared. Then it ended with a massive tragedy and the supernatural phenomena stopped. There is no doubt that something completely out-of-this-world occurred at Point Pleasant and you should not miss reading about it.<br />Exceptionally riveting journalism!eople where scared.

In its day, this book about an alien abduction experience, was something of a shocker. In a nutshell, a group of young men working as lumberjacks drive home one evening only to be stopped in their tracks by a glowing object in the sky. They get out of their vehicle, Travis Walton gets beamed up, the rest flee. Back in the town, and without Travis, they have to explain his disappearance. People start suspecting that one of them killed Travis and so a missing persons/possible homicide investigation gets underway. The men are given a polygraph test - they pass, and so they seem to be telling the truth about Travis and the UFO.<br />Then Travis turns up five days later and doesn't look the best. He tells a story about an alien abduction and he becomes a national celebrity. It certainly makes quite an interesting read. A 22-year-old forestry worker goes missing, six witnesses passing a lie detector test, say that he was last seen with a huge UFO, later he turns up to tell the tale. For years this encounter was heralded as one of the most important accounts ever of a UFO abduction and it certainly had me fooled too. I was a firm believer, no doubt about it, Travis Walton had indeed been abducted by aliens and had enough witnesses to prove it.<br />You must read this book, but please note that a lot of new information had since come to light which has debunked the entire story. I refer to the articles  &quot;Profitable Nightmare of a Very Unreal Kind&quot; by Jeff Wells (from The Age, Melbourne, Australia, 6 January 1979), &quot;Ground Saucer Watch&quot; Memo on the Walton Incident and &quot;Fire in the Sky&quot; -- The Walton Travesty by Anson Kennedy which can be found on the internet. Basically the lie detector tests where botched and Travis even failed a number of them. The person who conducted these tests was paid to never talk about them again, but he did. When you couple this with the facts that the Walton's have a UFO history and their original statements in the missing persons case are somewhat suspect because his family said that he would \\"turn up\\" because \\"UFOs are good\\" without expressing any emotion of loss and the refusal of the family and Travis to talk to anyone who doubted their story ended up with numerous researchers/reporters/investigators simply walking away from the case. The Waltons sold their story to the National Enquirer and it is not the same as how the events actually occurred. So basically the book is good and believable until you do a little more research and find that the story has been twisted and the participants in the story did indeed fail numerous polygraph tests. So it just goes to show how a little more checking out here and there can make all the difference when drawing your conclusions.issing persons case are somewhat suspect because his family said that he would \\"turn up\\" because \\"UFOs are good\\" without expressing any emotion of loss and the refusal of the family and Travis to talk to anyone who doubted their story ended up with numerous researchers/reporters/investigators simply walking away from the case.

The Whitechapel murders have seen no more than several hundred books written about the case but very few can hold the same standing as \\"The Complete History of Jack the Ripper by Philip Sugden\\" because it is the most meticulously researched and venerated work on the case to date. Sugden, tired of fictionist accounts of Jack the Ripper (most notably his mistrust of works like The Diary of Jack the Ripper by Shirley Harrison and Jack the Ripper: The Final Solution by Stephen Knight that are spruced up to support a bunk Mason/Royal theory or to point the finger in the direction of what is probably an innocent suspect in order to sell copies by truckload) has delivered on the most comprehensive and historical factual account of the Ripper murders by examining and reporting on the case from the ground up. Leaving no stone unturned, Sugden delves into the initial murders at Whitechapel, before the canonical first ripper victim - Polly Ann Nichols, and beyond the final canonical ripper victim - Mary Kelly, to include no less than nine possible ripper victims that must be taken into account when reviewing the Whitechapel murders in their entirety.<br />Nearly every available important newspaper story, witness testimony, court hearing, autopsy testimony, letter, investigation memoir and police report relating to the case are used to piece the history of the Whitechapel murders together. Unprecedented attention is paid to the victims, the circumstances of their death, their martial status, boyfriends, education, children, parents, work and place of dwelling before their death. All makes for an exceptional record of the Whitechapel murders which is as unsparingly in detail as you will likely find in any book of its kind. It is not until page 164 that the night of the double murder is dealt with. Make no mistakes about it, this IS the reference manual to which all other works will likely be derived from and compared too.<br />Sugden unearths some fascinating suspects that most of us knew nothing about. Lunatics that where unaccounted for, having absconded from the eyes of the law and their asylums, where at the forefront of the investigation and a lot of these characters are explored in the book. Characters that where seen with blood stained hands at the time of murders are tracked down and revealed for first time.<br />Surprisingly, the book doesn't really ever get off the ground like other ripper books. When dealing with probably the most infamous serial killers of all time you would expect much more electrifying passages and comments by the author but instead Sugden opts for a history lesson and data exploration.<br />Essentially this is a book about a changing Victorian London, the rising of the press, Jewish expansion of the East End, social conditions and the poor, the victims and their unfortunate past, the early years of CID and how the city responded to the Whitechapel murders. Sugden even goes into detail with relatively suppressed topics like the bloodhound trials at CID, undercover investigations involving officers dressing up as prostitutes, innocent but violent vagabonds being hunted through the streets seeking refuge with the police and the creation of vigilante groups who raised reward monies and patrolled the streets.<br />The book is written in an extremely flat way but like we have said this all goes to prove a point - that Jack the Ripper was no talent. He was no boogeyman and he is certainly undeserving of the personality that he seems to have been accredited with throughout the ages. Yes he was a monster, a sexual serial killer, but one who could easily slip away with a prostitute at the height of the murders without attracting much suspicion - although one important witness (of the very many that are covered in this book) may have actually witnessed an attack and the suspect. In many instances Jack took chances and in all probability he should have been caught. What you are left with is a feeling that the investigators probably had their man, had seen their man, had probably interviewed their man, but didn't recognize him for what he was. The more you play down the hype the more you begin to see what conclusions Sugden is trying to draw. That the investigators had not a single scrap of good evidence to go by and didn't get the break that they so sorely needed.<br />In the final pages of the book Sugden covers four Ripper suspects, - Druitt, Kosminski, Ostrog and Chapman. He gives Chapman good coverage and names him as the best suspect but the reader is left feeling that that there is a good case against Kosminski because he was identified as Jack the Ripper by a witness.<br />Pros:<br />- Meticulously researched, especially the victims.<br />- Extremely detailed account of everything connected to the case.<br />- Levelheaded approach to profiling Jack the Ripper.<br />- Everything is kept real and factual. Very limited guesswork and theories.<br />- Highly detailed bibliography and references including police files and their locations.<br />Cons:<br />- Needs more pictures, especially of the investigators, more Mary Kelly crime scene photos, more Eddowes morgue shots, photographs of the alleged Ripper letters, some pictures of news articles would be good too.<br />- Not everyone's cup of tea. This is not something that will grip you throughout from start to finish.<br />- Index is extremely limited to names and places. Could be much better.<br />- Not all the modern day suspects are considered or covered.<br />- Does not delve into the investigators' backgrounds as much as the victims.gators probably had their man, had seen their man, had probably interviewed their man, but didn't recognize him for what he was.

Okay, say the name on the tip of your tongue - The Diary of Jack the Ripper - and watch as the dollar signs flicker before your eyes. It was bound to happen sooner or later. The reason why the Diary is still popular today is because a few Ripperologists attached their name to it and few have had the guts to actually say that they where wrong and walk away from it. The Diary is essentially a mini-volume of notes allegedly written by James Maybrick, around the time of the Whitechapel murders, that sign at the end as \\"Jack the Ripper\\". So how does it read? Well it is reasonably fair to say that it is very creative reading and does keep you entertained, but then again that is exactly what it is meant to do. What we know today is that it is undoubtedly a forgery because the owner of the book Michael Barrett simply admitted to forging it himself.  End of story, really. So you might enjoy this book but remember that it is only fiction and the case is still far from solved.<br />What one must remember is that James Maybrick is still a Ripper suspect and was a Ripper suspect long before the advent of the Ripper Diary so don't discount this suspect just on the bases of this book being a forgery.<br />Click on the authors name and have a good look around. I am sure you will be impressed and the message will finally sink home. Shame about the Ripperologists who went pair-shaped hooking up with this book as the Real McCoy. There have been a few causalities because of it.
This is not a bad ripper book. It was published in the late 80s and had four different editions over the years.  It is considered one of the better ripper books. I picked it up in the library a few years ago and it is primarily aimed at revealing the Jew who was sent to an Insane Asylum shortly after the death of the last canonical victim of Jack the Ripper. In 1894, the Insane Jew was first suggested in the Macnaghten Memoranda, which didn't get much attention until recent times. Martin Fido tracks down the Ripper suspect and reveals quite a bit about this mysterious character who is still considered a prime candidate till this day. In fact the last time I checked he was in the top 5 and usually resides somewhere around second place. His name was Aaron Kosminski but there are several variations of his name found in old records including the name - Cohen. Anyhow you would probably like to know that some of the original investigators claimed that he was actually identified as the killer by a witness who would not testify again him because he was a fellow Jew. Unlike most Ripper suspects there is a very strong case against Kosminski. In fact one investigator went as far as to say that they knew that this man was Jack the Ripper and that he was put away in an Insane asylum. So if you ever heard the story about the Insane Jew who was Jack the Ripper - well this is where it came from.<br />If you are going to read a ripper book then get Philip Sugden's \\"The Complete History of Jack the Ripper\\" which is definitive and meticulous in its research value. He covers three or four Ripper suspects at the end of his book and Kosminski is one of them. Kosminski is not absolutely Jack the Ripper but he is one of the very strong contestants. This is the book that really brought the name into the public domain. Well worth examining if you can get it. Fido is a very knowledgably Ripperologists. He has several other books on the subject.<br />The reason why this book gets five stars is because out of all the Jack the Ripper books in print this is probably in the top 5 in my opinion. If you are to take the top 5 books (all that follow in Sugden's footsteps) then it would merit about 4 stars. Anyway try and get it.

The Name of the Rose is quite complex in its initial appearance which according to the author is a work of non-fiction derived from an old manuscript written by a monk called Abo of Melk that Umberto Eco has translated for all the world to see and read. It is a 13th century tale of this monk's youth spent as an apprentice to an ex-inquisitor, Brother William of Baskerville who has been asked by an abbot to uncover the truth behind a rather disturbing murder at his beloved abbey. The story is quick to adopt an investigative posture which not only involves all the hallmarks of a \\"whodunit\\" type story but also has Abo, and many other characters, questioning their own faith and the faith of others. The story is much more than just another detective yarn as Umberto Eco continues to depict scenes of spiritual debates, holy disorder, political corruption, religious rebellion, crimes of heresy and sexual misconduct which are as a contradictory to the life of a monk as the murderous crimes themselves. <br />There is much in this book to dissuade many from reading it in its entirety. The Name of the Rose is often cited as the bestseller that has never been read. There is much truth to this as I myself have often found that certain passages and lengthy debates would make one nod off as if listening to a sermon that carries with it a haze of sleepiness. No doubt many of the monks in this story have felt the same way too. There are many versus in Latin and references to historical religious figures that have no direct impact on the story but are only dished up to help Abo, and the reader, derive conclusions to many of questions found in the mind of a novice that are philosophical and metaphysical in nature. The Name of the Rose expounds on the correlations between order and chaos, much of which is linked directly to William's own ethics when carrying out his investigation of the abbey.<br />It is a hard book to read or follow because of its many Latin references, pseudo-religious-philosophical debates, but is as equally a hard book to forget or stop reading. No doubt without the \\"whodunit\\" elements this book would more suitable as special treatise hidden among the abbey's own Aedificium. Very few books leave you feeling somewhat attached to the story but The Name of the Rose ushers with it a very subtle relationship between you and William who acts as a farther type figure to Abo who is your eyes and ears in the story. Needless to say the actual impact of the book does not hit home until the final three or four pages. Everything else beforehand has been of interest to you but you don't quite know why. The book actually ends up posing more questions than it attempts to answer and this in itself is what is at the heart of The Name of the Rose. The final vestibule of assertion is made only in saying that nothing can be confirmed at all and good men should not seek to hold fast to Earthly possessions which eventually return to that from which they came. . . . including the story.<br />Appreciate it.
The first 100 pages sets up the basic premise and characters before launching into a nail-biting hostage drama and a chase across Europe for the kidnappers that leads back to the US. Although the character Quinn, the negotiator, is fully fleshed out along with the kidnapper Zack, the story is far fetched when it comes to the detective work. The kidnapping case comes to a climax half way though the book and I found everything fully believable and enjoyable until then. After this pinnacle part of the story it looses the believable part and just becomes strictly enjoyable. Unlike his other novels &quot;The 4th Protocol etc.&quot;, it seems to miss out on keeping the story simple and believable.<br />This novel is a bit like \\"Hannibal\\" in many ways. There are lots of disturbed villains with their own tastes and a great memorable character in the form of British gentleman working for the KGB, but alas it really does have some big plot holes and &quot;chance&quot; discoveries that leave you thinking that the book could have been planned a bit better with regards to that. Although the writer does go to great pains to tell us that detective work needs a bit of &quot;luck&quot; or a &quot;break&quot; in the case for things to work out, the breaks that Quinn gets are all too much to really believe. Other than that the novel is extremely easy to read and you will not put it down until you have finished that &quot;next chapter&quot;. Good show, shame about the severe bending of reality though. Keep it real Fred!! I much preferred the detective work in &quot;The 4th Protocol&quot; compared to this.
I am new to this writer because I thought he just wrote boring war stories for old men. I was quite surprised to find that he is a talented writer who is able to create a fast-paced, gripping thriller with a lot of psychological punch. If you are reader of good fiction, even science-fiction (like me), then try this book out. It has many technological surprises.<br />The story is basically about a top level Russian official who wants to bring down the current british government (maggy thatcher, hehe) and install his own covert government (the opposition, labour!). In order to do this he needs to sway the majority of the british vote to labour by launching a semi-terrorist type attack on a small british town. Seems odd? Well not at all because Forsyth makes you believe it by throwing in some of the most coolest characters alive since &quot;Gorky Park&quot;.  Although the first 100 pages are pretty slow going you will finish this book in no time. Big surprises, nice plot twists and a courir service from hell.
