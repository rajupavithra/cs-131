Another winner in the Raw Foodists library.  Detailed with lots of info and encouragement.  Go raw, everybody.
Kids TV has gotten worse.  Parents: do you ever watch this stuff.  It's mind numbing at best, corrupting at worst.  And anti-Christian to say the least.  Read this book.  And get your kids doing something constructive.
A Christian who challenges the [stuff] our children are subjected to.  Thank you.  The harmfulness of these toys should be obvious.  But parents don't bother to be involved or take a stand.  If you're serious about your Christian faith, eliminate the violent/sexual/occult influences from your children's lives.  It's that simple.
Lauri Ward has created the most useable decorating book I've ever read.  The way she takes an existing room and rearranges what's there is pretty amazing.  The photos are clear.  The advice simple.  Very refreshing with so many other books out there showing the finished product, without taking into account that most people aren't starting with an empty room and an unlimited budget.  Good job, Ms. Ward!
A much needed book.  Learn what you can about the Masons then make up your own mind.
This follow-up to Use What You Have Decorating is fabulous.  Ward goes beyond glitzy magazine photos and shows the nuts and bolts of how to actually achieve these great looks.  She really proves that good design is not about throwing thousands of dollars at a room.  And she gives advice anyway can use, at any level of their decorating.  And if you're disappointed that there aren't a lot of big colorful pictures to look at, then I suggest checking out a few children's books from your library.  Otherwise, prepare yourself for a real treat from this classy designer.
His critics dismiss Texe Marrs with the label \\"Fundamentalist Christian.\\"  So be it.  But at least he takes a stand.  At least he reads the Bible of his faith.  At least he applies it to the world around him.<br />I like Marrs' books.  They have the excitement of conspiracy theory.  But grounded in Bible study.  If you don't believe in the Bible (or are afraid your friends will think you're a nut if you do) you probably won't like his books.  But if you're into Bible prophecy, and use the Christian Bible to guide your life, then I think you'll appreciate Marrs' perspective.<br />I'll admit, I try not to put any Christian writer on a pedestal.  God is still the definitive Author.  But there's a place for writers who use the Bible to comment on current events.  I appreciate the work they do.  Especially when it prompts me to go back and read Bible passages they've pointed out.<br />So, Mr. Marrs: I thank you for taking so much flak, yet still keeping the faith.  And I eagerly await your next book.
