As a policy analyst people often ask where my views lie politically. I often answer that they lie somewhere between Pat Buchanan and Dick Gephardt, and I emphasize that I am passionate about the issues where both Gephardt and Buchanan agree: A love of Country, American trade, and integrity in government. Although Gephardt declares himself a liberal, he stands apart from the \\"New Democrats\\", and resembles \\"Old Democrats\\" like FDR who saw the need to use government to rebalance the relationship between business, government, and The People.<br />Gephardt outlines how American Democracy is in decline today as a result of the \\"politics of destruction,\\" lack of citizen \\"participation\\" and \\"ownership\\", as well as the focus on divisive issues. He offers a personal account of the life events that have shaped his worldview and the major problems he sees facing America today, particularly healthcare, education, and maintaining a living age in our new economy. He offers some strategies to get people involved in the political process and create a better country for everyone.<br />Although this book was written in 1999, it is a very timely account of Dick Gephardt's policy views as he challenges other candidates in the 2004 Democratic primary. I found the book very pleasant to read, and was left wondering why the National Democratic party has moved away from his traditional views toward the shrill intolerance of today's liberalism. Gephardt may be the last hope for the middle-class working family.
This story recounts how dangerous Aircraft Carriers may be even out of combat as the author describes how a series of failures on the USS Forrestal created one of worst naval accidents, killing 134 men in 1967, as the crew was preparing to launch an air offensive on Vietnam.<br />The story, which centers on a tragic fire, looks at the incident from various sailor's perspectives, and paints an excellent picture for the reador of real life on an aircraft carrier and the mindset of a group of young men battling for their survival againt two of a sailor's greatest enemies -- Fire  and the Sea.

Many biographies have been written about Hyman Rickover, the father of the Nuclear Navy, which focus on his dictatorial idiosyncrasies and leave the reader wondering how anyone could have ever worked for him. In \\"The Rickover Effect: How One Man Made A Difference\\" author Ted Rockwell discusses how Rickover's leadership style created a paradigm shift among all of the organizations he came in contact with focusing away from the status quo and toward operational excellence and high-reliability. Rockwell, who worked for Rickover from 1949 to 1964 and served as the Technical Director of the U.S. Naval Reactors Program (NR) between 1954 and 1964 is certainly in one of the best positions to discuss his perceptions of Rickover's personality, work ethic, and style.<br />One of the quotes from the book that impressed me very much was that Rickover questioned how people who admitted they could never have accomplished what he had done -- building the first atomic submarine from abstract concept to reality in record time - could question his leadership and management style. Critics generally focus on Rickover's demanding style as ruthless and insensitive, when in reality he was building a committed organization and shaking out those that were not as dedicated as he was. It is quite obvious that Rickover would never had asked anyone to do anything he was not willing to do.<br />Rockwell's story encompasses his recruitment out of the post Manhattan Project at Oak Ridge until Rickover's death. While Rockwell left the Naval Reactors program 1964, he continues to write about how Rickover's influence shaped his management and technological paradigm and allowed he and two of his co-workers at NR to open an engineering firm delivering outside of the Navy the same operational excellence and high-reliability systems they had developed in NR. Rockwell also discusses how leaving Rickover's program changed their relationship.<br />Rockwell's book is a pleasant read, as his story is not overly technical and draws readers into an appreciation of how the Naval Reactors program influenced work systems and quality management. This book should be of interest not just to those interested in the life of Hyman Rickover and the Nuclear Navy, but persons studying leadership and culture management, technological advancement, and the career of Ted Rockwell - one of the unsung heroes of nuclear technology.

Man's ability to harness he boundless energy of the Atom has forever changed the world. Nuclear Pioneer Ted Rockwell recounts his role in \\"Creating the New World\\" in a series of thirteen essays describing the evolution of his 60 years in Nuclear Technology.<br />Rockwell is truly one of the American history's unsung heroes, having worked on the \\"Manhattan Project\\" supporting the development of the world's first Atomic Bomb, serving as Technical Director of Admiral Hyman Rickover's Nuclear Navy Program that founded America's Nuclear Navy and built the first commercial nuclear power plant at Shippingport, PA, and co-founded a leading engineering firm specializing in high-reliability technologies. Rockwell is also the author or editor of several government publications, articles in trade magazines, as well as a book  -- \\"The Rickover Effect: How One Man Made A Difference.\\"<br />One of the most astonishing facets of Rockwell is that despite his incredible technical accomplishments, he is able to relate his experience in the nuclear industry in a way that non-technical people like myself understand and appreciate. Throughout the book he is able to relate political, social, and technical issues clearly and persuasively, to give an appreciation of the subject matter.<br />The first four chapters discuss his work in the Manhattan Project from the time he was recruited out of college into the program at Oak Ridge. He does a great job describing the life style during World War II, explaining how the people banded together to build a community dedicated and their optimism of ending the war through the secret weapon they were developing. The next three chapters mesh Rockwell's work in Rickover's nuclear navy program and explain how his work there defined the values and principles that ultimately made him who he is today. The remaining chapters discuss some of the defining moments later in his life, such as his work evaluating the Three Mile Island accident, discussing the fallacy of that being pro-environment means being anti-nuclear, and revealing the other 90% of nuclear uses that people rarely think of. His overall theme in this book is to show that nuclear technology is \\"understandable and beneficial\\" to society.<br />This book is a must read for anyone that works with nuclear technologies and particularly serves as a means of conveying the history of the industry to the next generation of nuclear workers. However, anyone seeking to learn more about the evolution of nuclear technologies from a historical perspective would also benefit.<br />The one flaw I found in this book is that it retells some of the same stories that were part of \\"The Rickover Effect,\\" although at a different level. Then again, if the stories were not the same in both books, that would leave me scratching my head also.cy of that being pro-environment means being anti-nuclear, and revealing the other 90% of nuclear uses that people rarely think of.

Many people say that this fifth book in the Harry Potter series is a bit of a dissapointment, but readers will find that as usual, Rowlings spends a lot of time setting up the plot and referring to history. Much of this dissapointmentlikely stems from the length of the book, which is easily overcome through the audio edition. Grammy-Winning Narrarator Jim Dale has a different voice for each character (how does he keep them all straight) and brings the book to life, more so than even the movie could do. Owning all five sets of the audio edition, I can say I have gotten my monies worth out of them all. However, this time around, I opted to go with the pricier CD version, as my experience with the tapes have been that they sometimes break from extended use.
\\"A Republic, Not an Empire\\" is a History of American Foriegn Policy dating back to the founding fathers up until the 1st US-Iraq war. Buchanan's thesis of the book is that the United States should not get involved in Military interests that do not threaten the American nation. On the contrary, he suggests that America's participation in treaties, protection pacts and other reciprocal actions lure America into military and political intervention that ultimately undermines American Soveirnty and dilutes goodwill among other Nations. Unfortunately Buchanan's critics interpret his work as anti-semetic for criticism of US Isreali policy rather than seeing the patriot Buchanan who supports \\"America First,\\" fighting the encrouchment of a new global order than seeks to gain from America's loss. Packed full of hisotircal references and quotes, this work is a valuable review of American Foreign policies and the mindset of our founding fathers.
Buchanan's new book \\"The Death of the West\\" provides the thesis that declining birthrates in the Western World will lead an end to the Western civilization, to be taken over by peoples of present third world civilization. He argues that only third world peoples, such as Mexicans, Islamics, and Chinese are populating at a rate of above replacement, with potential for expenential growth over the next fifty years.<br />Buchanan also explains why the western world is not meeting population replacement, which he states is largely due to cultural shifts that accept birth control, the proliferation of abortion, and the growth of a female workforce that doesn't value or prioriize marriage and children. The U.S. soltuion to declining population has been to inccrease immigration, an act which furthers the concept of multiculturalism, and will lead to a decline in a unified concept of the nation-state. He furthers this by statuing that as traditonal Americans die off and are replaced by those that no longer want to embrace our nation's heritage, that all the history of this great nation will be forgotten, and the greatest Nation under God, will be gone forever. Many of these immigrants are bringing the third-world to the West, rather than adapting to Western values -- which uphold the economic systems that provide the better life that immigrants seek in the west. This will ultimately lead to the West becoming Third-World nations by 2050.<br />No one writes quite like Patrick J. Buchanan. Every section is packed full of history, footnotes, and statistics -- all of which reinforce his argument and political position. Some may call it rhetoric, but it is obviouly the truth -- and yes it hurts. Unfortunately, people who do not agree with Buchanan call him a racist, or a facsist. In reality, he may be a clarvoiyant. This book for me explained why Buchanan may disagree with our efforts in Afghanistan, and earlier during the Gulf War: the problem is defense of the homeland at our borders -- until we manage that, all other efforts are fruitless.<br />I also recommend Buchanan's \\"The Great Betrayal,\\" and \\"A Nation, Not an Empire\\" as compliments to this book and Buchanan's America First-Anti-Globalism mindset. \\"Right From the Beginning\\" is a little slow and difficult to follow as it is more an autobiography than a policy study.rs -- until we manage that, all other efforts are fruitless. <br />I also recommend Buchanan's \\"The Great Betrayal,\\" and \\"A Nation, Not an Empire\\" as compliments to this book and Buchanan's America First-Anti-Globalism mindset. \\"Right From the Beginning\\" is a little slow and difficult to follow as it is more an autobiography than a policy study.
I have never really folllowed compeitive bodybuilding, but recently decided it was time to get in shape. In my quest to transform myself I founf this book written by Bob Paris, about his journey through competitive bodybuilding, and his eventual withdrawal from it. Reading his story I have to new found respect for the sport, and most of all for him, as he turned way from the body building establishment because of value conflicts. After reading this book, I'll never be able to look at a Weider product the same way.

Many biographies have been written over the past 40 years about the impact that the life of Admiral H.G. Rickover has had on the United States Navy  one in which redefined the role of the Navy in the post World II era. All of these works have focused on his many accomplishments and the controversies that surrounded him, which often conflicted with the executive branch of the Federal government, naval shipbuilders, and the U.S. Navy itself. Few, if any, clearly demonstrate who Rickover was, and how his principles evolved. No doubt, the author of Rickover: The Struggle for Excellence, Francis Duncan, is the only biographer afforded enough access to the Rickover as an outsider to the Navy and its Naval Reactors program, to know him well enough to accomplish a detailed account of what shaped the man. This book, the third in a series by Duncan, tells the stories from birth till his death, remarking on events that shaped his priorities and principles, and addresses many of the unanswered questions or mysteries that readers of other biographers may have found in the story of Rickovers career. Some of the misconceptions about Rickover that Duncans work clears up are concerns such that Rickover had lied about his age or that Rickover had been for the most part unsuccessful and out of place in the Navy prior to his work with Naval Reactors. Unlike the Polmar and Allen Rickover biography, which often appears lengthy and intimidating as an all encompassing view of Rickovers life, Duncans work is very readable and pleasant. I assume that Duncan knew that the larger than life Rickover story could never be captured in single volume, and separated his works, which describes his evolution; Nuclear Navy, 1946-1962 which deals with the influence of Atomic Energy on the modern U.S. Navy, and the Rickover and the Nuclear Navy: The Discipline of Technology, describing the founding and management of Rickovers technical program.<br /><br />Although the emphasis of most Rickover biographies has been his impact on the Navy, his story serves two other main purposes. First, from a management and organizational behavior perspective Rickover seems to break all the rules and still maintain a highly committed program that integrated safety, reliability and high-performance He embedded principles and expectations that continue to exist today, and are the core of the Naval Nuclear program. This is the ultimate measure of a founders success, for an organization to remain relatively static around what principles and values drive its core mission. The second of course, is Rickovers influence on the operation of civilian nuclear power plants, an accomplishment that Rickover thought he was unlikely to achieve when he was forced to withdraw from Shippingport. However, his influence and principles have filtered down through the personnel he trained through NR, and have subsequently redefined nuclear power operations in the Post-TMI era of nuclear power, and forced a paradigm shift in nuclear power operations and realigned the thinking about the discipline required to operate high-risk technologies.<br />My only criticism of Duncan is perhaps his fondness of Rickover, which comes through in his writing. Considering all of the negative stories of Rickover, I would expect more negatives in his depiction of Rickover as well. However, biographies are written about the life and accomplishments of great men, and gossip and scandals best left for supermarket tabloids.the emphasis of most Rickover biographies has been his impact on the Navy, his story serves two other main purposes.

This is a helpful tool for practicing concepts of geometry, and stimulation of memory. However, it may not be helpful if you never had any experience with geometry.
My litmus test for any book like this is that it is easy, and pleasant to read. Senge does a great job explaining a difficult concept -- understanding relationships and systems thinking. Written back in the early 1990's, this book is a bit dated, but readers will unlikely be able to find a book that covers the subject of organizational learning system as easily and thoroughly as this. I bought this book because several others I was reading on the subject referred to this text, and felt that Senge was the Master. After reading, I agree.
The only things better than reading Harry Potter is listening to Jim Dale's narration, and the variety of voices that bring the story to life. You will not be dissappointed. My only caveat is that the tapes will probably wear out if you listen to it as often as my family does. Next time I'm going for the CD version.
This work, originally published in 1995, was Netanyahu's policy statement on terrorism -- both domestic and international. The sum of the book, the last chapter, outlines ten steps that western democracies should take in order to slow or irradicate terrorism.<br />Unfortunately, Netanyahu's predictions of what would happen if these policy recomendations were not taken seriously, have come true in recent months -- signalling that perhaps the U.S should give Netanyahu a dedicated ear. The problem confronting modern democracies is complacency, regressive policy formation and a focus on appeasement. Netanyahu has a particular clarvoyance on terrorism, and is able to make a clear-cut case for his policy directions, citing historical cases -- many in U.S. History -- where drastic measures were taken to save the Nation. The intent is to help overcome the fear of losing the &quot;freedoms&quot; which come with a zero tolerance policy -- which he likens to &quot;Obsta Principiis&quot;<br />This book is a pleasant read, and offers a focused overview of terrorism resulting from, as Netanyahu states, the Islamic hatred of Western Civilzation -- which he portrays as not hating the West because of Israel, but hating Israel because of the West.<br />It should also be noted that this book now is in its 2nd edition, which includes a forward commentary by the author reflecting on the Sept. 11th 2001 terrorist attacks.
I purchased this booking seeking to better understand the tactics that the federal government are using to combat domestic terrorism. What I found was a historical account of Mr. Coulson's illustrious career in the FBI, which started with the civil unrest of the 60's with militant groups such as the black panthers, to Timothy McVeigh and the Oklahoma City bombing. No doubt his career was unparralled. His story is very real and paints a picture not only of his role, but the transition of the FBI from the old Hoover regime to modern times. My only critism of this work, was that I was looking for a cut and dry analysis of &quot;counter-terrorism&quot; and a quick read. This is a rather lengthly book, most of which is very interesting, but not something that can be read in one night.

This book is actually a pictorial book of a Nuclear Power Plant. It has a narrative that explains the nuclear power industry, and an overview of how the plant operates: Its key components, etc. However, this is not a scholarly work, and seems to be geared more toward a jr high student level. I used it to explain nuclear power to my children. The pictures are also excellent.
I have recently been doing some research on ethnographics, trying to better understand how the operating culture of nuclear power plants evolved. I was directed toward biographies of Admiral H.G. Rickover, and I found Duncan's work to be one of the most enjoyable readings on Rickover. Duncan gives an inside view to the Admiral and the history that led to the success of the Nuclear Navy through a historical account. The author's relationship with the Admiral, which was probably closer than many other biographers, shows Rickover a hard-driven centrist leader who stressed technical competence and sought excellence and integrity, as well as a respect and dedication for the high-risk technology. My only criticism would be that other biographies of Rickover dealve more into the Admiral's idiosincracies and somewhat odd expectations -- traits that leave the reader wondering if Rickover was crazy or a genius. I look forward to reading Duncan's new book \\"Rickover: A Struggle for Excellence\\" when it is released November 2001.
We have been trying to get my daughter potty trained since she was two years old. We started because she showed interest in the potty, but she has not been consistant. We purchased many &quot;potty books&quot; so we could reinforce the importance of using the potty, and to give her something to do while she was sitting on the potty. However, our approach was lacking the motivation to keep her consistantly trying to use the potty on a regular basis. This book provides that motivation. It is a book of 126 stickers with a fun chart which maps out my daughter's progress. She loves the variety of fun stickers, which are definately original and found no where else but this book. We just got this book, and I hope that in two months, at age three, she will be on her way to &quot;big girl undies.&quot;
This is by far, the best book on behavioral safety I have ever read. Dr. Geller has a very laid back style of writing, which is very comfortable to read and easy to understand. He outlines many psychological theories in a very comprehensible manner, and reinforces ideas with models and anecdotes from his own experiences.<br />My interest in Total Safety Culture was its application towards unleasing latent resources in the union environment, essentially making safety a common ground for labor relations. This book is well worth the money, and a cover to cover read will likely make you want more.
Boyte and Kari articulate the breakdown of citizenship in America, emphasizing the decline of shared experience and ownership in American public life. The dynamics of modern work, have taken people away from collective experiences, creating a contemporary society that places little value on individual contributions to the greater society. Boyte and Kari explore the relationship bewteen work and democracy, which they believe are both on the decline in America.<br />Much of what Boyte and Kari write of, to me, reinforced the mainstay of Roosevelt's New Deal policies of putting people back to work -- which ultimately restored their dignatity, created identity as people contributed to society, and restored faith in American Democracy. This was an unparalled time in American History, where the people believed in their leader, accepted common values, and reuninited a fractured nation -- all on social-psychological terms based on collective participation in public life.<br />I found this to be a very interesting and informative book. The book is relatively easy to read, and reframes the the problems of public work and democracy from a historical context -- which from my eyes makes it a very educational and worthwhile work.
In this book, John Donohue challenges the promise of privatization as a cure-all to the problems of government. He offers a persuasive argument which defines the two realms of privatization, and follows up with a discussion of when privatization is sensable. He reframes the privatization debate from several general areas.<br />Donohue draws three basic conclusions from his work. First, that the best elements of government to privatize are those in which the government can precisely specify in contractual terms the work to be performed. Second, He explains the lengths at which it is reasonable to go to make a privatization effort work. Third, to emphasize the need for competitiveness -- albeit from private companies or government itself.<br />The book is well written and researched, and is easy reading.
Light does an excellent job in this book describing the government's manupulation of the &quot;True Size of Government.&quot; Light makes several important points in this very important work, which addresses contemporary issues in public management. He describes how the government is portrayed in numbers of civil servants -- creating an illusion of smallness -- but often neglects to point out the numbers of state, local, and third-party government participants that nearly double the size of the workforce the government reports. Light also points out that the girth of government may be shrinking, but the organizational levels continue to grow as changes in the government workforce have driven an exponential growth in government executive positions.<br />Light is an excellent writer, and visionary in government studies. You will find this book very informative, and easy to read.
My objective in purchasing this book for my two-year old daughter was to get her to overcome her fear of the potty, and to be more patient. Now she can sit and look at the book, while she sits on the potty.<br />So far it is working quite well. My only criticism is that little kinds tend to rip the pop-up pictures and levers.
The book is a compilation of 22 &quot;human factors&quot; research projects in nuclear power plants, performed to address the issues of safety and risk reduction. The papers are written by a variety of internationally known nuclear experts, and represent the most current studies available in one source. The focus of the research is the affects of human interaction with engineered technology.<br />Unfortunately, because of the narrow scope of interest in this book, it is unavailable in most academic libraries. This is probably the most expensive book I have ever purchased. With that in mind, I must say I have no regrets. To purchase these studies separately through information services such as NTIS, would like cost about $40 each ($880 total). The information is solid and credible, and will likely serve as validators to my masters thesis.
In this work on horiziontal maangement, D. Keith Denton writes of the need to delayer modern organizations and push reponsibility and accountability for work down to the lowest levels of the organization -- where the work is being performed.<br />The emphasis on his customer-driven model is creating employee involvement and empowerment at the level that interfaces with the customer. Denton's background in process management is apparent as he tells of traditional production models which often excluded customer needs and wants -- an American  shortcoming that I often attribute to the rise of globalism.<br />Although the book is nearly 10 years old and out-of-print on Amazon.com, I believe that Denton is a visionary in customer-driven management systems, which makes this book a very important work.<br />I believe you will find this book to be very easy to read, enjoyable, and thought provoking.
Kimball Fisher writes about the heart of modern management, the need to develop employees at all-levels and tap latent organizational resources through the emphasis of employee involvement in team-based programs.<br />Fisher makes many of his points through analogies, which makes his work a delight to read, and easy to remember. Two of his analogies have taken a firm hold in my mind. The first is about the difference between the Shephard and the Sheep herder, and the second about not &quot;eating the sausage.&quot; Both analogies describe the need for management to support workers, so as to create quality and efficiency in the absence of rigid oversight.<br />The book is well-written and easy to read, with information compartimantalized in understandable &quot;sound-bites.&quot; The book is packed with models and concepts which promote the use of team based programs, and descibe the proper roles of team members and management.
I can't think of a better way to share the miracle of birth of Christ with my children. This is an excellent children's book.
Somehow I escaped reading Catcher in the Rye in High School. I am not sure if it was because of the Holden Caufield in me, or if it was never part of the curriculum. Anyhow, in the interested of expanding my frame of reference and shared experiences, I ordered a copy. I found it very difficult to read, as I was put off by the language in the book. No doubt the story is a classic, but I found it somewhat distracting to read.
The Policy Making-Process is a classic primer on the policy making process in the United States. The author, Charles Lindblom is considered a classic thinker in American Policy, who emphasizes diversity in decision making in order to create &quot;intelligence.&quot; In short, he advocates getting more people involed in the process, as well as soliciting a wider point of view.<br />The book is set up in four parts. First, he introduces the nature of policy-making, writing of the challenges, limits, and potential of American policy-making. Second, he writes about the impact of government and politics on the policy process in creating change, or more often holding on to the status quo. The third section describes the broader influences of polciy making, and articulates that policy making by &quot;The People&quot; is often an up-hill battle. In the fourth section Lindblom offers advice how to improve the policy process.<br />I believe this is an excellent primer on the topic because it simplifies a very difficult process, and creates a broad understanding, which a reader may use as a basis to delve further into policy-making.<br />Lindblom's work is very reader-friendly. It is short, to the point, and easy to read.
The Revolt of the Elites articulates the growing disonnectedness between the social classes in the global economy. Lasch's work, for me, was an extenstion of Robert B. Reich's point in the Work of Nations,  where he predicted that &quot;knowledge workers&quot; would secede from nationalistic idealism to become members of a globalist higher society. Lasch's thesis is based on this growing trend, which he sees as ultimately threatening American democracy and identity.<br />This reframing of America's social decline is consistant with the views of many prominant social conservatives and anti-globalists. As such, it draws much criticism from groups who have a stake in the economic changes that have taken root over the past thirty-years.<br />Despite the average rating of this book, open-minded readers will find Lasch's work to be well thought-out, convincing, and a pleasure to read.
The authors of this book provide an easy to implement model of transformational leadership based on four points, which they call the four I's. The focus of their full-range leadership model is a long-term transformational change, as opposed to short-term transactional models. The author's model reflects the importance of leadership and vision in creating organizational &quot;buy-in,&quot; driving competitive change, and creating self-sustaining organizations through the growth of like-minded leaders.<br />I found this book to be well-written and easy to read. The authors apply the model to a wide-range of organizational situations. The only limitation to this book that I found, was a question that I posed to the model, which questions the validity of the model if the culture does nor support the leadership and vision. I suppose though, that the authors would counter argue that if the culture did not support the leadership and vision, that the basis of their model, the four I's were not being implmented properly.
If you are like me, you were probably turned-off by economics in school with all the graphs and formulas to determine how many widgets to make, and sell at what price. I have found over the years though, that having an understanding of economic theory is very important to critical thinking, especially in terms of management, politics, and economics in general.<br />Malabre's Lost Prophets is a very friendly introduction to the various economic thinkers of the last 100 years. His journalistic writing style draws the reader into the thinkers realm, and explains the theory and history related to each &quot;prophet.&quot;<br />The book is well written and easy to read. I have found it to be a complement to my other scholarly reference material.
At times, I find myself reading other books that refer to various economic theories that I am either unaware of or do not fully understand. I have found that Heilbroner and Thurow have done a very thorough job in this work to create a laymens book on economics that is easy to read and understand. I have found that this book in particular, serves my needs very well, as a primer on basic economic theory.<br />Robert Heilbroner is an excellent writer, notwithstanding his liberal slant. Lester Thurow, was the author of my college econimics text. The combination of the two, creates a powerful synergy and delivers a superb product.<br />I believe you will find the book reader-friendly: Easy to read, full of answers to of the laymens questions, and even somewhat enjoyable to read.
I must admit that when I read this book, I was a bit dissappointed at the lack of new information. As a student of labor history, I had read previously many of the ideas and concepts that Rifkin expands upon in several other books. I only wished I had picked up this one book, prior to reading all the others. It would have saved me much time and money.<br />In short, Rifkin decribes the transition of the worker from pre-industrial revolution, through the era of machines and mass-production, and the advent of the information age in which he predicts there will be fewer and fewer workers. His analysis describes how this effects the worker, organizational make-up, employment relationships, and even how government has been forced to change to accomodate the modern economy.<br />I believe that anyone interested in the dynamics of technology and globalism on the workforce will find Rifkin's work very interesting, well-written, and easy to read.
My nine-year old wanted to get a copy of Harry Potter because it was all the rage. I bought the book for him, which was supposed to be written for his grade level. I found he had a terrible time with the names. We ended up buying the cassette, and reading the book a long with the audio tape. This made it much more pleasant to read, but it is not the most economical way to enjoy the story. Next time we may just go for the tape.
My whole family loves Eric Carle. The Very Quiet Cricket is well recieved by the children, as they like the cricket noise at the end of the book. However, I must concur with other critics of this book that the names of he bugs in this book detract from the ease of reading, or more specifically the memorization of the words. The kids always want me to read it to them over and over.<br />Brown Bear, Brown Bear does a much better job, and may be a better addition if you don't alreay have it.
In my study of modern work systems I have often found that the top-performers are characterized by those that communciate well. Rick Maurer's feedback Toolkit is a very simple model to better communications in the workplace. Most of it is simple common sense, but the bottom line is that these simple solutions are still not being used in many organizations today.<br />The book is easy to read, and written step by step. No one could miss the meaning in this book. After I read it, and highlighted everything that was contradictory to what was happening in my organization, I slipped it under my bosses door. No doubt positive change is coming!
My objective in purchasing this book for my two-year old daughter was to get her to overcome her fear of the potty, and to be more patient. Now she can sit and look at the book, while she sits on the potty.<br />So far it is working quite well. The muppet theme helps!

I initially purchased this book as an assigned reading for a masters course in Organizational Management. My inital preconception was less than favorable, as I had not signed up for the class to learn about diversity, but to better understand the barriers to organizational change. What I found from Loden and Roesener was a focus on four areas -- sterotyping, poor communications, collusion, and culture clash -- which I found very useful in meeting my personal objectives for the course. On the issue of sterotyping, the author's talk about primary and secondary dimensions that affect our percptions of people. These translate into obstacles in commucation. The authors also write about collusion: how individual action or inaction affects the organizational staus quo and inhibits change.<br />The book is well-written and easy to read. This book will no doubt meet the needs of creating a better understanding of workplace diversity from a human resources perspective, as well as provide a deeper understanding of the dynamics of organizational management.
In this work, Edgar Schein articulates the importance of understanding organizational culture as a means of implementing change. His theory is that the ability to manipulate culture is a key tool of modern management. He theorizes that organizational culture reflects the leadership and vision of its founder, and that organizations become self-sustaining through buy-in to the culture.<br />Schein provides a complex model for diagnosing culture and analyzing the values and assumptions of the organization. He also emphasizes the importance of understanding the dynamics of the stage of organizational culture, prior to implementing change.<br />An interesting point that Schein makes is the need to periodlically &quot;unfreeze culture&quot; and apply a &quot;cognitive reconstruction&quot; -- in short repond to market pressures by becoming more competitive through organizational change.<br />Schein's work is very thorough and easy to read. My only criticism is the length of the work, which is the result of Schein's many real-life examples that reinforce his points.
Author Martin Gross does an excellent job challenging the educational establishment's claim that poor student performance over the last thirty years is due largely to factors outside of the classroom. In a hard hitting  way, Gross articulates that the  establishment -- teachers, administrators,  and education buearucrats are responsible for low performance, due to their  quest with new ideas and the mandate for a growing educational  bureaucracy.<br />I started reading this book while doing research on American  class-size reduction policy, and had revealed to me little discussed  arguments against current educational policy, as well-as how and why the  facts are supressed.<br />If you question the value of the education your  children are recieving, or are interested in the &quot;school choice&quot;  debate, you'll probably find it hard to put this book down. Given the  straight-forward arguments of Gross, I look forward to reading his other  books as well.
The book attempts to create a paradigm shift from the optimistic traditional American dream of hard work and reward, to the more pessimistic global reality of being displaced by big business as the social classes  polarize.  Greider takes on an immense task as he presents a macroeconomic  view of the global economy, which he states has caused a decline in the  standard of living for the average worker since 1974.  His main argument is  that the free running of global capitalism has recreated the conditions  that preceded the Great Depression -- excess supplies of goods and labor,  an expanding inequality of wealth, and social exploitation in the name of  free market economics, which threatens global economic crisis and social  revolution.  As multinational firms fiercely complete for global market  shares, they abandon the national interests of their home country and  disregard any social obligation that does not promote short-term profits,  including displacing or exploiting workers.  Without multilateral  intervention that would regulate global commerce and protect the rights of  workers everywhere, a world economic and social crisis is inevitable.<br />Greider successfully illustrates the struggle between labor and capital:  Organized labor's power to control wages and working conditions, which has  traditionally been grounded in its ability to limit the supply of workers,  has been decimated by the mobility of capital.  In a global market, there  will always be workers willing to accept a lower wage as opposed to no  wage.  As this Awage arbitrage@ forces earnings down, the middle class with  disposable income will slowly disappear.  Grader's argument of the economic  model looks carefully at the demand side of the equation and asks -- who  will buy the surplus if there is no middle class with disposable income?  Capital driven by profits and quick returns at all costs are ignoring the  fundamental relationship.  Labor needs capital for income, and capital  needs labor's income for profits and growth.<br />Greider also illustrates a  breakdown in American democracy: A government no longer run by the people,  but by big business, which makes government the broker of deals that only  serves to further breakdown our domestic economy in the interest of the  free-market.needs labor's income for profits and growth. <br />Greider also illustrates a  breakdown in American democracy: A government no longer run by the people,  but by big business, which makes government the broker of deals that only  serves to further breakdown our domestic economy in the interest of the  free-market.
Juliet Schor makes a variety of intersting points. Her main argument is that people today are working an average of 163 extra hours of paid employment each year. She talks about the paradox where employed people are  forced to work overtime, while the underemployed can't find enough work.  She speculates why people are working more, especially with the &quot;cycle  of work and spend&quot; that most of us are in. She is describing the  trends that have creeped up on us, wherby work has become all consuming,  and people don't know how to relax or recreate anymore. She even writes  about the new American Pastime, mall shopping.<br />My initial thought was  that the book seemed hurried, and very random in its writing. But it did  force me to realize why I am working more, and the fact that I have  forgotten how to relax.
Jo-Ann Mort's book is a collection of articles about the changes that have been taking place in the new AFL-CIO. Under the leadership of John Sweeny and Linda Chevez-Thompson, the AFL-CIO has been reivigorated and has taken  on many new project, such as &quot;America Needs a Raise,&quot; a call for  all Americans, Union or not to have a living wage and a rising standard of  living. In prior years organized labor just tried to hold onto what it had,  and saw its influence with the democratic party decline. But today's  movement has focused on recruiting new members, and building membership in  America's unions to secure a voice for all Americans. Many of the articles,  such as &quot;Part-time America Won't Work,&quot; which is about the 1997  UPS-Teamster's strike against the transitionto a part-time work force, are  important to most people. Prior to 1995, it would have seen likely that  organized labor would slip away. But today, with the new AFL-CIO's energy  and issues that address the economic plight most American, seem to have  momentum. Who would have thought of IBM employees trying to unionize  fifteen years ago?
Wilson's argument is that the global economic reorginization that has taken place over the last thirty years has significantly decreased the number of manufacturing jobs available to unskilled workers. Many workers  who formerly worked in manufacturing have adapted the the new service  economy, but the unskilled workers that could not adapt have been left  behind. The result of this job loss has been severe in the urban ghetto,  whose population in predominately black and has not been able to socially  assimilate into societal norms and become functional in the service sector.  Over time the result of chronic joblessness has prloferated a culture that  has been moving further away from cultural norms, indoctinating itself into  &quot;ghetto related behavior and attitudes,&quot; and creating a new  generation of urbanites that have little hope of betterment.<br />What is  interesting about Wilson's argument is that a continued globalization could  threaten other employment sectors, displacing workers that are not the  traditional urban poor. The point being, in a fast paced, high technology,  global environment -- although his case is the extreme --it is likely that  people who are left out of work, or out of society for any length of time  will have a difficult time becoming productive to society again.
Robert Kuttner takes on free trader's myth, which perpetuates the need for pure markets and limited government. He points out how this ideology, which has brought about the deregulation of many industries and continually  pressures for reduced government spending  -- on infrastructure, research  and development -- has seriously retarded wide economic growth. The result  of the U.S. economic policy over the last thirty years has created widening  income inequality, limited access to universalities such as health care and  basic economic security, and a breakdown of democracy that was established  to protect American citizens from private tyranny. He challenges the  free-market ideologues that continually influence politics and law by  preaching the rhetoric of whatever the outcome of the market must be  optimal if it is the result of the operation of the market. Kuttner  explains that the myth is allowed to perpetuate not do to economic  problems, but because of a lack of political power on the part of most  Americans.<br />Kuttner makes a fine argument through his comprehensive survey  of most sectors of the American economy and the social effects of  unregulated capital. Moreover, he points out that pure market efficiency is  only possible in spot markets, and rarely occurs in reality. He further  faults the free market ideologues on their notion that everything can be  reduced to markets, citing that markets in certain items are contrary to  public policy or unlikely to be produced due to the theory of free-riders,  such as with public infrastructure. Kuttner explains that the corporate  call for &quot;pure markets,&quot; freed from regulatory constraints, is  really a corporate call for liberation from its extra-market commitments to  community and charity.<br />Kuttner's position for alleviating most of these  problems that have arisen through the &quot;pure market&quot; myth is to  increase the size and stance of government to a more socialist form similar  to those of Western Europe, with a mixed economy.  He calls for the  government to intervene by taking over administration of extra-market  commitments and universalities such as health care and pension benefits,  and provide incentives to corporations that are socially responsible to  their employees. Moreover, Kuttner seeks a redistribution of economic and  political power through a return to a progressive tax system that weighs  heavier on persons with greater wealth and income. He contends that  Americans need to display the habits of a strong democracy in order to keep  markets in their place.<br />After reading this book, it is obvious that Mr.  Kuttner is very passionate about the subject for which he writes. My only  critism of his work is that it is a bit cumbersome.those of Western Europe, with a mixed economy.

Madrick describes the subtle economic decline in America that has taken place over the last thirty years. Many people find themselves working more hours, or even a second job without getting ahead. The rise in social  problems, lack of faith in the government, and America's poor economic  performance are approached from a historical perspective, where Madrick  cites the underlying problem as &quot;a sharp slowdown in economic growth  from our historical average of 3.4% a year, and often higher since the  Civil War to a little more than 2% a year since 1973.&quot;  He makes the  case that politicians and economists often look at economic indicators to  determine economic expansion or recession, but fail to acknowledge that the  slow average economic growth over time has had a somewhat irreversible  effect on lost production, which he has estimated to be about $12 trillion  over the twenty year period of 1973 to 1993. As a nation we tend to blame  these economic problems on inflation, government budget deficits, low  levels of investment, faltering education, or the irresponsible politicians  and their special interest spending -- which are really symptoms of the  root cause, slow growth. Conversely, Madrick presents a positive  correlation with the increase of growth in productivity as the solution to  all of society's problems.  Furthermore, he makes the case that the decline  cannot be rooted to any political party, change in moral values, or the  rise in special interests -- but has to do with the corporate America's  reluctance to identify and adapt to the changing global marketplace.<br />  Madrick tells of America's second frontier of mass production which had  once given the U.S. a great competitive advantage: having the operating  experience to produce large qualities at a small enough unit price and  distribute it over the nation's large consumer base --  which is  unparalleled in the world. While American businesses were caught up in a  paradigm of mass production of standardized products with broad marketing,  the rest of the world began systems of flexible production of specialized  products, produced for narrower markets. This coupled with the reduction of  trade barriers and the ease of entrance into U.S. markets created  competition that American companies had never before experienced, and were  unprepared for. As their corporate paradigm shifted, and companies began to  realize that what had once been was no longer, they reacted by trying to  compete through reducing costs-- such as reducing labor or wages-- rather  than focusing on increasing their productivity. Corporate America's failure  to adapt to the changing market conditions, essentially caused an economic  retreat in industries where American companies felt they couldn't compete  -- most noticeably in manufacturing. Madrick presents a model which  represents the cyclical decline created by the internationalization and  fragmentation of markets which create cost cutting and lower wages, which  further creates uncertainty, which creates weak investment, which leads to  lower productivity and more lost jobs, then reduced consumption which  compounds the slow growth, which only starts the cycle of cost cutting once  again.<br />All in all, Madrick has written an excellent book that is easy and  enjoyable to read.roduction of standardized products with broad marketing,  the rest of the world began systems of flexible production of specialized  products, produced for narrower markets.

In this very reader-friendly work, Max Green describes the slow demise of the American Labor movement. His thesis rests on the fact that the emergence of the New Politics of the New Democrats in the late 60's early  70's brought the political aspect of organized labor away from the  &quot;bread and butter&quot; issues of Gompers -- which rejected socialism  -- to an increasinly liberal movement with declinig membership and  influence.<br />He shows how this drift has coincided with labor abandoning  the political center for the political left, and how its traditional  approval of capitalism has turned into an unhealthy skepticism of market  forces that is increasingly out-of-touch with the modern world. In short,  the democratic nature of unionism was undermined by the New Lefts direction  toward seeking special protections for minorities, rather than seeking  gains for the whole. He further points out how the policies of the New Left  actually hurt a core group of union members, middle class white America,  and forced them to seek poltical representation outside of the traditional  Labor-Democrat relationship. Thus was born, the Reagan-Democrat.<br />Green's  work is well documented and worth reading, and has serious implications in  contemporay society. Of greatest importantce is the need for middle America  to gain representation -- a third party -- that would seek a more equal  distribution of wealth. In short, raising the economic standard of living  for all will likely adress the social issues of minorities as well.
In a revisionist look at labor history in the 20th century, Melvyn Dubofsky counters the typical claim that government has played a repressive role in government-union-capital relationships. His argument, not accepted  by many labor scholars, is that labor benefitted in the long-run through  the states intervention -- atempting to diffuse the potential revolutionary  zeal of the masses by appeasing them with small gains.<br />Dubofsky's  methodology launches a liberal attack on Marxist thinkers and activists by  challenging the view that government is a tool of capital to hold workers  in check. His work points out that unions gained when the people organized  and threatened militantcy. Government sought to appease labor through  putting pressure on capital. However, when labor crossed the line actually  becoming militant and acting out against the states authority, government  sided with capital -- an action more in line with providing the economic  stability everyone needs.<br />Labor history in a raw sense is both shocking  and appalling. His account of labor history is packed with detail, and  historical accounts which sometimes get in the way of his thesis.
Many of us outside of the manufacturing sector have not yet seen the changes that the global economy has in store for us.<br />In his economic model, Reich points out the &quot;vestigial thought&quot; of the American  corporation -- which today consider themselves &quot;global&quot; with no  ties to its home country. His point is that America as a nation should  welcome foreign investment if it will provide jobs to Americans. The global  economy, as he models, is comprised on global webs, with knowledge workers  with ideas in the center, surrounded by support services that add global  economic value and bring concepts and products to fruition.<br />He also  segments labor in the global economy into three catagories. Symbolic  Analysts (or knowledge workers) who have the greatest chances for success,  in-person services which are not readily suceptable to downward wage  pressures, and routine producers which have already seen jobs shipped  overseas to totalitarian areas with low wages.<br />More important than his  global economic model is the subtlties that lie deep within the text. At  first glance these may be missed, but a careful study reaveals several  important caveats.<br />First that the global economy will likely mean less  social mobility to the majority, with an ever increasing inequality in the  distribution of wealth: Hence, the end of the middle class. This means that  in a global economy, there may not be enough jobs paying living wages to  support our already declining standards of living.<br />Second, Reich points  out the improbability of of everyone becoming sybolic analysts -- which is  evidence on the growing population of people today who can not even perform  basic skills. He refers to a study by William Julias Wilson, writen in  &quot;When Work Dissapears.&quot;<br />Third, that as the rich get richer and  further segment themselves from others, there will less of a connection  between them and the poor -- a defacto end to the trickle-down economic  theory. They also will continue having their own schools, private services  etc, (their own private government) furthering the rift. He points out that  the government has to take a careful approach to these people so as not to  make them leave the U.S., taking with them the economy that revolves around  them.<br />Reich half-heartedly makes a few suggestions about investing in  training, education, and healthcare as a means of giving all people an  equal economic opportunity, but that also may be &quot;vestigial  thought.&quot;economic  theory.

Any negative review about this book could not have been written by anyone who read it. Buchanan writes about Our Great Nation and its slide into a declining standard of living that has been breaking down the Nation since  the age of Free trade in America.<br />Buchanan documents quite well where  America once was economically and socially, and its slow decline into  globalization. He makes a good case backed up with solid reason and  evidence that America should revert back to a &quot;protectionist&quot;  system of trade, whereby tarriffs would be applied to foriegn imports that  serve to destoy American industry.<br />Buchannan makes a case that  &quot;protectionism&quot; in the past paid off national debts, brought  about a balanced budget, a surplus funds, lower taxes, and a higher  standard of living. Buchanan points out that free trade only works when  everyone plays by the rules.<br />The book has solid statistical information  and a lot of historical perspectives that most people never learned in  school. My only criticsm of this book is the many historical quotes that  slowed the book down for me as I reflected on what events were occurring at  that time.<br />No doubt I am a better person for reading Buchanan's  perspective
