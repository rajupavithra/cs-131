I admit.  What brought me to this book was the opposing negative reviews and positive reviews and witch war excitement generated by this author.  So I bought it.  Damn good non-fluffy bunny pagan book telling a true (I think) story of initiation.  I've never read a better one.<br />I really think that the author is hiring people to write the positive AND Negative reviews since it has generated a great deal of interest here in the U.S.  The bookstores here in New Orleans can't keep it in stock.  As soon as the local Pagans heard there was a controversy surrounding The Quest  they ran to the book stores to buy one.  They initially bought all of them.<br />Good for them, thats why I bought mine.  Damn glad I did.  GREAT BOOK!  I am American I love America and I love this book.  I can't say as much for those Welsh people who aren't so nice so I really don't care much for them, but I really like the description of Wales.  I think Wales is neat and I think Welsh stories are neat, but I hope the Welsh reviewers are not anything like the Welsh people that I will meet when I go there.  yes, I am going to visit Wales and Caer Idris and the Fairy Ring and Mt. Snowdonia.  Yaaaaaaa.<br />Thank you Rhuddlwm whoever you are.
I have read almost a hundred books on Paganism and Witchcraft, then someone told me about these Welsh Athiests that were trashing this authors books.  Clearly they don't like the authors but the certainly never read the books.  My goddess!  This is an excellent book.  Want to start a coven?  Do magic?  Make magic tools? do rituals?  Its all here.  it should! I think there is over 500 pages here!  And its not cheap.  But it is soooo good!<BR>I will not let this book out of my sight.  No one borrows this one!
Well what can I say.  I've read them all, witchcraft, welsh history, philosophy, medicine, But this book actually kept my attention for more than 10 minutes.  Excellent Read.  Don't know about the claims, but I'm waiting to be convinced.
The opposing negative reviews and positive reviews and witch war excitement brought me to this book.  But what kept me reading was an excellent description of The Welsh Witchcraft tradition.  I do love a mystery.  I have been interested in Welsh Witchcraft for years after reading one by simmonds.  This book gives a true rendition of the practices, which can be confirmed by reading any good Welsh book on Mythology or pre roman history and archeology.<br />This book is a good non-sensational book telling a true story of witchcraft initiation.  I've never read a better one.<br />But, the author must be hiring people to write the positive AND Negative reviews since it has generated a great deal of interest here in the U.S.  The bookstores here in Detroit can't keep it in stock.  As soon as the local Pagans heard there was a controversy surrounding The Way they ran to the book stores to buy one.  They initially bought all of them.<br />Good for them, thats why I bought mine.  Very glad I did.  GREAT BOOK!  I am American I love America and I love this book.  I can't say as much for those Welsh people who aren't so nice so I really don't care much for them, but I really like the description of Wales.  I think Wales is neat and I think Welsh stories are neat, but I hope the Welsh reviewers are not anything like the Welsh people.
This book is causing a great hubub in Welsh Pagan circles only because it has been mentioned by pagans who want to be known as the be all of Welsh Paganism.  They don't want a yank to be known as a Welsh Witch, so they have inlisted the help of neo-wales extremists who invent e-mail addresses and keep trashing the author.  Not the book mind you.  The book is great.  The book is true.  And how would I know?  Because until last week I was loosely associated with this bonkers group.  They have become nasty and obsessed and totally bonkers.<BR>'<BR>The book is Great.  The author is honest.  The time is right.

I live near Aberdovey, Wales on the coast. I love my country, but I am ashamed of these neo-extremist so called Welsh people who<BR>instead of actually reviewing a book, they attack the author. I will be a disappointment to them all. I met Taliesin einion Vawr back in 67.<br />He was an egotist of the fourth order and treated us all horribly. But he said he and his cousin were responsible for initiating Rhuddlwm Gawr and giving him his name. I never met Rhuddlwm and cannot confirm or deny that he exists.<br />I dropped out of the Dynion Mwyn Group in late 68. I became and still am a solitare Witch. I read this book when it was first published in the late 70s and confirm the author captured the teaching method perfectly. that is one of the reasons I left. It was too primative.<br />I do believe that Dynion mwyn was at least 50-60 years old when I became a member. It was at least as old as taliesin's aunt who<BR>paraded around the farm as if she was the queen. I cannot verify any of their claims, but I can verify they existed. So the so called trash Dynion Mwyn group are not only wrong they are bloody wrong. The one person I really liked before I left was a Mr. Martin who was our astrology instructor. I don't remember his first name, i was 19 when I attended their classes.<br />I heard several years ago that they moved near Cardiff and slid underground as I did.<br />This book was a wonderful book because it brought back old memories and it was a reminder of what i had experienced when I was young.<br />Thank you author whoever you are.

Well someone has got to thank whoever started this witch war mentality regarding these books by Taliesin Vawr and Rhuddlwm Gawr.  It brought this book to my attention and it is now a part of my reference library.  Also thank you Amazon.com.  I live in a part of the country where it is almost impossible to obtain any form of occult books.<br />I just bought three more books by taliesin Vawr and Rhuddlwm Gawr and others.  I will be reading them over the next few weeks.
Excellent portrayal of Welsh Crystal Magick.  The critics would like you to think there are no crystals in Wales!

This book is about Welsh Mythology as taught by a tradition of Welsh Witchraft: Dynion Mwyn. It is a controversial group. The Welsh Nationalist extreemists hate them. The Christian Welsh extremists hate them and Pagans who make their money teaching rubbish as knowledge hate them. They don't charge for initiation. and they don't require students to do anything they have a problem with. They almost sound tame don't they?<br />There is a great deal of Welsh Mythology material in this book as well as other traditions and philosophies.<br />I have spoken to a few groups who are angry that they could not prevent the re-printing of this book. They claim there are &quot;secrets&quot; which are exposed.  One of the authors of this book, Taliesin enion Vawr was initiated into the New Reformed Order of the Golden Dawn as well as into Gardnerian and Alexandrian traditions. I believe he was also contemporary with and claimed to know Robert Cochrane, who worked with Doreen Valiente.<br />The authors use a great technique of presenting generic terms and ideas which masks the real philosophy of the Welsh Tradition, but<BR>teaches you enough so that when you actually enter into training as a seeker of the Welsh tradition, it will be very easy to pick up the wonderful religious ideas and Mythology of the Welsh Pagan Tradition. <br />All in all I would say that this book would give you a tremendous education into the Mythology which a great deal of Welsh Witchcraft is based on. I recently visited one of the two groups in Cardiff Wales that practice Dynion Mwyn last month and I assure you, they are using the Mythology as described in this book, PLUS much much more.<br />If you are looking for a book which describes Welsh Pagan Mythology as taught by Welsh Pagans, you have found it.<BR>Read this book carefully. It is a winner, and well worth the money.<br />Linda Prior <BR>London UK

One of the authors of this book, Taliesin enion Vawr spent years learning herbology from his aunt and passed this knowledge on to others in the Dynion Mwyn tradition.<br />If you are looking for a Celtic Herbal written by Welsh Pagans, you have found it.

It contains a great deal of material that is similar to NROOGD teachings which originated in California. I have spoken to a few of their members who are angry that they could not prevent the re-printing of this book.  One of the authors of this book, Taliesin enion Vawr was initiated into the New Reformed Order of the Golden Dawn as well as into Gardnerian and Alexandrian traditions. I believe he was contemporary with and claimed to know Robert Cochrane, who worked with Doreen Valiente.<br />The authors use a great technique of presenting generic terms and ideas which masks the real philosophy of the Welsh Tradition, but<BR>teaches you enough so that when you actually enter into training as a seeker of the Welsh tradition, it will be very easy to pick up the wonderful religious ideas and ritual philosophy. <br />The seasonal rites in this book appear to be very similar to the Celtic Tradition of Gwen Thompson and are not Gardnerian, nor are they NROOGD of which I am an initiate of both. <br />The Sabbat rituals contain a few modern verses written by modern poets which I am grateful for. After all isn't a tradition supposed to grow and change? <br />All in all I would say that this book would give you a tremendous education into the techniques and philosophy of ritual and rites as it is currently being practiced in Wales by actual initiates. I visited one of the two groups in Cardiff Wales that practice Dynion Mwyn last month and I assure you, they are practicing The Ancient craft as described in this book, PLUSmuch much more.<br />If you are looking for a book which describes Rituals and festivals as practiced by Welsh Pagans, you have found it.<BR>Read this book carefully. It is a winner, and well worth the money.<br />Linda Prior <BR>London UK

I am Welsh.  I speak Welsh.  I learned Welsh History.  I am proud and protective of my Welsh Heritage.<br />This book only adds to my knowledge.  It is astounding how close this philosophy is to what I was taught by relatives.<br />If you are Welsh and want to find out what else is available besides accepted history, please read this book.<br />It is massive,  It costs more than two of your average useless wiccan books.  Thats because it is real.<br />I will read it again and again and again.  Thats because everytime I read it my spirit is aroused.  Thats what is so strange.  This book opens something in my spiritual self that makes me closer to the Gods.<br />I hope you are affected as profoundly as I have been.
I have read the Way several times.  Once in 1985 and twice over the last month.  Those critics who have given it poor reviews obviously haven't read the Way.  It does not contain theosophical teachings.  I know.  I'm a theosophist.  These critics must have read something else. They also dislike the author.  It is obviously a personal thing and has nothing to do with the value of the Book. I have a degree in Welsh History and a long association with the Welsh Folklore Society. Besides actually visiting Betws-y-coed and tracing the authors life, I have interviewed several members of Y Tylwyth Teg in Florida and two members of The Dynion Mwyn &quot;mother grove&quot; in Wales. Very interesting people. I may debate whether the family which taught the authors, was totally correct in their philosophy, but I can say they were honest and sincere. I found nothing inconsistent with the ideas and words in the Way. In fact, I was hard pressed to contradict anything they purported to believe. Those who are criticising the book are listening to rumour instead of reading the book. I wonder why they don't want you to read it? If in fact it contains some ideas and words allegedly taken from other sources, so what. I have read over sixty books on Witchcraft in the last 17 years which are like reading a carbon copy of each other. But, I also have read the Way. From whatever source these Co-authors obtained their material, it is fresh and absolutely wonderful. No, the critics didn't bother to read the books. They just have a problem with people reading the truth. The author(s) must be doing something right. A very famous book store in California has already (according to them) sold over a thousand copies. Good for you Rhuddlwm. You've done good. Excellent Book on Welsh Witchcraft.  There is a rumour that someone is talking to the author about a movie project, based on the books he has written over the last thirty years.  I am looking forward to seeing it.
I have read the Quest several times.  Once in 1981 and once again over the last month.  Those critics who have given it poor reviews obviously haven't read the Quest.

Excellent Book on Welsh Witchcraft.  There is a rumour that a production company is talking to the author about a movie project, based on the books he has written over the last thirty years.  I am looking forward to seeing it.
Well I've read it twice and those who have given it poor reviews obviously haven't read it at all.  I have no idea why they dislike the author, but it is obviously a personal thing and has nothing to do with the value of the Book.
