I forget when I first read the series, but I loved it, and still do. My mother loves the books, too - she read them as a child. And now my brother in the eighth grade is starting to read them - he doesn't always get into books as much as my mom and I, but he's enjoying the series so far. Overall, I strongly recommend these books to anyone with an interest in mythology, fantasy, or the paranormal.<br />I suppose I should include a bit about the books - Susan Cooper combines ideas from British and Celtic myths with a more modern setting, in England and Wales, with a memorable cast of characters. It's a really great story about people from myths with ancient magic living in a modern world.
