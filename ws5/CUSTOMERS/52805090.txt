I got a bit bored by the first chapter & didn't regret it much when my father borrowed this book. Then 4 months later, a friend gifted it to me as a birthday present and I started on chapter 2.  It's a cross between a noir (LA confidential jumps to mind) & a travel book. If you like either form, you could like this. But if you like both, as I do, this book jumps & grabs you & drags you right in. <br /> <br />I lived in Bombay - Now Mumbai - for 14 years a lot of the locales are familiar. I've visited a lot of the places in the book, even the Sapphire dance bar. I even got beaten up by the underworld once but probably a really low hack. Looking through all this through Suketu Mehta was like visiting a completely different place. I don't want potential readers to think that it is essential to have lived in Bombay to enjoy this book. That just makes me look at all the places written in the book in a different light. <br /> <br />This is a wonderous book.  <br />
A few thousand year old mystery kept secret is solved in just a few hours by the protaganists. I tried hard, really hard to enjoy this book but it is too light a book.<br />Read the &quot;Quincunx&quot; instead.
This book was my introduction to Evolutionary Psychology years ago. While browsing Amazon, it has been recommended to me again. I am writing primarily as I feel that 5 stars are not enough.<br />Elsewhere on these pages, many have reviewed the book itself. I would like to add that not only does the prose sparkle, but reading the book might make you view people's behaviour anew. I found myself doing that.<br />Read this book. It is provocative and entertaining. This is one of the few books that actually had me 'tingling' like a good mystery does......
Some months back, I went to a bookshop in New Delhi &amp; found one copy of each of the Myron Bolitair series. I bought two titles as they seemed interesting. Two days later, having finished both, I went back &amp; bought the entire lot &amp; both the Non- Myron Bolitair books; which meant that I had cleaned out their Harlan Corben stock as they only had one copy each.<BR>The bookshop owners then went &amp; re-stocked many more copies of each title,<br />It's difficult to suggest a specific Harlan Coben Book: I found them all tremendously enjoyable. Read any one &amp; you will be hooked. It isn't necessary to read them in any order but I would recommend that start from the first as Myron's life will then unfold as lives should.... The crimes at the heart of each book can be read in any order.

I started reading this book quite some time ago &amp; left it a couple of chapters short of the ending. Now this should in no way be a presumption that this book turned me off. Its just that I like reading half a dozen books at a time: while travelling, while walking &amp; while (though my boss may not be too keen on this one) working. When I resumed reading this one, I found that I had to start it from the beginning, as, &amp; this is evident from some of the other review, this book is not an easy read.<br />But that was the best part: I got to read the fun stuff all over again. If you like Mathematics or better yet, if you love mathematics, this book is a must. If you have already read this book, you must read it again. However, if you have not done at least some college mathematics, proceed with caution.<br />As others have said, this book is not an easy read but the more effort you put in, the richer is the reward. There were two chapters that I didnt quite get. I think I am going to read the book again.
