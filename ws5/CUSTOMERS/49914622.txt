Robert Griswold and all the Love tapes from Effective Learning Systems (I have over 10) are great. I have used a few different tapes by others and none of them even come close to comparing!

First of all, she spends too much time talking about herself and her beliefs before she gets to the hypnosis. You have to fast-forward, screen, etc... Secondly, as someone with a chronic illness, her views that all  illnesses are self-created and can be self-cured are EXTREMELY INSULTING!   The &quot;Love Tapes&quot; (just a name) are SO MUCH BETTER, and no, I  don't get a commission for that.
