Compared to the generalized pap on the internet and in quick-'n-easy self-help books, I Don't Want to Talk About It is a substantial, worthwhile contribution to our knowledge about depression. Terrance Real, whose wife is also a therapist, has spent two decades counseling men and their families. From his considerable experience, he gives you his thoughtful take on depression. He believes there is covert depression which men may hide through drink, work, womanizing, etc., and, usually sparked by a sudden problem, overt depression which is the best opening to deal with the underlying problems that started in childhood. Although most of the many case studies Real provides involve fairly traumatic childhood events, he repeatedly makes the point that trauma can be either active--which gets our attention--or passive, the passive can be mild or extreme neglect, and some kids will react strongly to what society might think of as trivial. As one example, consider the man whose father hugged him and said he loved him for the first time when he got his MBA--a BA just wasn't good enough. Says Real, &quot;Passive trauma in boys is rarely extreme; it is however, pervasive.&quot; Becoming a man is not so much something that boys naturally grow into but typically means a loss of the relational: first, mother, then the self, and then others. Once the subtly insecure base has been created--the worries of worth, the feelings of emptiness--the next step is to invite boys to escape the doubts and pain by &quot;grandiosity,&quot; the illusion of some kind of dominance--work, work, work, financial success, violence . . . But when the crutches are kicked away, splat, the men and their families wind up in Real's office.<br />While Real does not provide a step-by-step recovery plan, he describes so many vivid cases that you see how it works, and how hard the clients have to work. First, they must give up their &quot;addictions.&quot; Then they must re-assess and treat their relationship withthemselves, using the mature parts of their personalities to &quot;re-parent&quot; the underdeveloped. And then re-establishing relations with others, often beginning with such concrete tasks as helping with the dishes or carrying a child's photo to look at in times of stress.<br />One great strength of this book is that Real can write: His prose is sensitive, sophisticated, and most of all fluid. His case studies--although too many to remember--are grippingly realistic. Another strength is his balanced, mature treatment of gender roles in our society. I feared a &quot;men's movement&quot; approach but found one beyond that. Another strength is that Real speaks from a lot of experience and hard thinking. Although the book would have been more powerful at 280 rather than 380 pages, he conveys his views convincingly. Of course, the inevitable warning is: This is not main stream, comprehensive, orthodox text on depression. It is at once more limited and much better than that.

I'm going back to read this book again. Kabatznick writes with the equanimity that convinces me she knows what she is talking about. The cornerstone of her advice is so easy to say and so difficult to make part of your life: Desires arise, and they pass away; watch they rise, do not pig out, and watch them pass away. Of course it is difficult, as is anything worth achieving.
Shunryu Suzuki's book has become a Zen classic in North America. I think this is in part because the book is quite accessible at first reading, and, then, later, you can reread a chapter and get much more out of it. For example, if the atheist who stopped reading at the chapter God Giving were to re-read the chapter, he would see something new. Suzuki uses &quot;God&quot; as a means of relating to his audience, mainly Christian Americans of the 1960s. His point is about the non-duality of person and &quot;God.&quot; Then, again, if I re-re-read the chapter I'd realize that . . . This is a simple and profound book.
