Bukowski had the guts to expose the underbelly of the<BR>American dream, where broken warriors wander lustfully<BR>throughout the forgotten streets, ever in search of<BR>something to silence the pain. He is as honest a writer <BR>as America has seen since the great days when the beats<BR>held court, taunting late 1950's sensibilities. It's not<BR>pretty, but neither was the life that Bukowski choose to live.<BR>Pick up this book and read it, then pass it on to a friend.
I love this woman's writing. I started The Vampire Lestat<BR>on my way to work one morning and it entrapped me to the<BR>degree that I phoned in sick on my way downtown and<BR>proceeded to spend the day in a couple of nice bohemian<BR>cafes, totally immersed in the world which this gifted<BR>writer created. There are very few writers who can write<BR>with the type of authority and clarity which she possesses.<BR>I would love to sit around a campfire with her, Poe and Stephen<BR>King-those would be some tales!
Bukowski is the type of writer who invites you out for<BR>a drink to his favorite bar and the next thing that you <BR>know it's two years later, your swimming in your own vomit<BR>and and living in a dive hotel right out of one of your<BR>very worst nightmares. But, he sure can write. Compare<BR>this book to Down and Out in Paris and London by Orwell.<BR>Why is it that Bukowski is not recognized for what he was:<BR>a great American poet and purveyor of folklore <BR>chronicling the exploits of society's eternal misfits?
This is undoubtedly one of the best books available<BR>for the reader who is seeking to broaden their <BR>understanding of basic philosophical issues. Pirsig<BR>is very clever at weaving in and out of complex <BR>investigations into the basic assumptions which tie<BR>down and restrict our thought processes. He does this <BR>by means of a compelling storyline and an accessible<BR>writing style. I read this book in my junior year in <BR>college and it was provided me with more insight to <BR>the foundational questions upon which many belief systems<BR>are based then any other book which I read during college.<BR>Pick it up. This book is for the type of person who enjoys <BR>an intellectual challenge.
I would heartily encourage you to spend some time<BR>with this book. Whitman is a joy to read and his<BR>love affair with language is extremely contagious.<BR>As a poet, Whitman expanded the allowable bounds<BR>of poetic expression and as such was one of the true<BR>founders of free verse as a mode of expression.<BR>He is one of the best voices in America's young<BR>cutural foundation. This is a book which young<BR>poets should spend a summer with: it will open your <BR>imagination to a new degree
Herbert is a rare type of writer that combines a<BR>fanciful imagination, a deep and probing intellect<BR>and an innate ability to create and control tension<BR>within a well written story. I am not an avid SF <BR>reader, but I would unhesitatingly recommend this<BR>fine book to readers looking for a thought provoking<BR>journey into another world. I would especially recommend<BR>this book to beginning writers so that they might spend<BR>some time with a verteren pro like Herbert,who will<BR>certainly teach them how to construct and develop<BR>a complex storyline.
I read this book about every five years or so in<BR>order to take inventory of my personal life. Soon<BR>I find myself forgetting about DVD players and software<BR>applications and begin to focus upon bringing<BR>my life much more in tune with the harmonics of<BR>nature. Thoreau has the ability to cut through the<BR>messages of nonstop consummerism and force the reader to<BR>evaluate the cutural norms of greed and individualism.<BR>Why is it so hard to accept that man is of this planet<BR>and we must learn how to balance our species goals and<BR>desires with those of the other species of life which<BR>inhabit this biosphere?
I am a writer and I found myself unable to write for<BR>at least a couple of months after reading this novel.<BR>This man can write with such an erotic, intelligent,<BR>and poetic manner that it can be a little overwelming<BR>at first. This is the type of book which will linger in <BR>your mind long after you have finished it. This book will<BR>challenge you to embrace the beauty of language as an end,<BR>in and of itself.
It is very hard to write a review of this book which doesn't<BR>come close to the length of the original. Pynchon makes<BR>the reader work. He tests your continued awareness and<BR>concentration and rewards you with an great tale told by<BR>a writer with that rare capacity of being able to entertain<BR>and enlighten, often within the same sentence. He is one<BR>of the best at developing complex scenarios which are<BR>carried through the various permutations by an able cast<BR>of characters. You may struggle with this book initially, <BR>but as is true with many things in life, you will be<BR>rewarded for your efforts
Marquez has such an eloquent way with words. He can<BR>also spin an excellent tale as evidenced by this book.<BR>But, what I enjoyed most about the book was the strength<BR>and depth of emotion which he was able to convey through<BR>the written word. This book pulls you into a magical and<BR>morbid world and holds you hostage until the ending. It is<BR>an immense book, but well worth the committment. I would<BR>especially recommend it to young developing writers. This<BR>book will definitely increase your artistic perspectives.
I recently bought this book as a present for my daughter<BR>to read and that prompted me to fish out my old road worn <BR>copy which I carried around religiously during the days her<BR>mother and I bummed around the western US &amp; Mexico.<BR>Kerouac always had the ability to spiritualize the <BR>experience for me. This book exemplifies his respect<BR>and admiration for those individuals who have forsworn the <BR>luxuries of a normal life for the intrisically demanding<BR>rigors of the spiritual quest. Rereading this book had <BR>me aching to be back on the road once again. Want to do<BR>Mexico again, Angela?
I have a daughter in college and to encourage her reading <BR>habits we read a novel at the same time, switching off as<BR>to who picks the book. I choose this one and she absolutely<BR>hated it for the first 100 or so pages until she fell under <BR>its trance, much like I did. To those of you who think that <BR>Kesey was a one book wonder, please take the time to read<BR>this book. You will not regret it.
Tom Robbins has this amazing ability to draw you into<BR>a world in which he defines the parameters and casually<BR>draws the reader into an internal debate over basic life <BR>assumptions. I always appreciate a writer who can tell<BR>a story, but when you find a writer who can do this on<BR>a couple of different levels, that is rare indeed. I would<BR>highly recommend you book a ticket for this one.
I read this book as part of a high school<BR>independent study program. I almost had to<BR>take the course over again in summer because<BR>part of my review of contemporary America<BR>authors included a book-Catch 22-which was<BR>not on the School Boards &quot;Approved Books&quot; <BR>list. When I asked why wasn't it on the list,<BR>they answered that it wasn't on the list because<BR>it wasn't approved for independent study. Hhhm...<BR>what was this book about? To make a long story<BR>relatively short, they begrudingly gave me a passing<BR>grade and I wrote my first newspaper column for an<BR>underground newspaper in Chicago. Read this book.<BR>Question authority.
I think that every good aware American citizen should<br />read this book every five years or so. Our freedom is what<br />makes this country so great. The freedom to be different.<br />The freedom to dream and love according to your own<br />desires. Go into Orwell's world of supression and<br />live out the danger with those who dare to rebel. I<br />read this book to remind myself that the freedom we all<br />love and flourish in, can be restrained in the name of<br />the &quot;state's interest.&quot; Reread this book. Encourage your<br />kids to read it. Orwell is an excellent writer.
Orwell was the type of writer who was so <BR>dedicated to his calling that he abandoned his<BR>petty bourgeois ways to take up with the<BR>scavengers, feeding off the crumbs of <BR>respected society. Poverty seemed to have<BR>cleansed his writing style and given it a hightened<BR>sense of intensity. I lived this book when I read it.<BR>I would highly recommend it to aspiring writers.
The first time that I read this book was in the<BR>back of a Grayhound bus from Chicago to San Francisco.<BR>I was a sophmore in college and coming out to visit<BR>my brother for the summer. My journey mates included<BR>a teenage runaway couple from Indiana, two drunken<BR>AWOL sailers heading to Vegas and a kindly old fat lady<BR>who fed us beans and tortillas the whole way. As I read<BR>the book I used to imagine that Kesey was on the back <BR>of the bus taking notes. Read this book. You will<BR>be moved by it. Kesey is a great writer with a knack <BR>for spinning a tale of enlightment.
Carlos Castaneda is a magical writer. He is a master<BR>at drawing you into a mystical new environment and<BR>captures your interest to the extent that you end up<BR>questioning major cultural assumptions you make in <BR>your own belief system. Very few people question basic<BR>existential questions anymore. It is pity. The drug <BR>issue in this book is very overblown. They are but a<BR>vehicle to awareness, never an end in and of itself.<BR>Different cultures use different vehicles. I myself would<BR>suggest a long walk on a foggy San Francisco evening,<BR>but that's probably because I live in San Francisco. Read<BR>this book, it is one of those that could change your life.
I like Nicholas Sparks. He is unpretentious, yet is a <BR>master when it comes to manipulating the emotional state<BR>of the reader. It is very refreshing to find a book which<BR>lets the reader wander through a time of innocence and<BR>indulge in the longings for true love. Read this book and<BR>take a short vacation from life.

I really liked this book. The author is very good about<br />pulling the reader into the emotional discourse of the<br />story. I have read one too many dry witted well executed<br />books of late. It was a nice change of pace to read a<br />story in which I found an emotional attachment with the<br />characters. It's an old story, with familiar hooks, but it<br />worked for me.

The story is fairly simplistic, but I really was impressed<BR>by the excellent character development which made the book<BR>a very entertaining read. It is harder to develop complex<BR>characters within a simple storyline. When it is done well,<BR>as in this instance, it results in characters which seem to<BR>outlive the book and follow you around in your head<BR>for a couple of days. I would definitely recommend this book.

To me, the magic of Tom Robbins is that he can slowly <BR>bring the reader to the point of examining fundamental<BR>questions about existence, before the reader has a chance<BR>to throw up his cultural defenses. He is a rare breed<BR>in that he can spin a great story which plays on different<BR>levels of consciousness. I would be hard pressed to recommend<BR>a better book of this type of folk wisdom genre.
If you have ever read Tom Robbins, and enjoyed him,<BR>you owe yourself a favor to read this book. It is<BR>typical of his style in that it takes a while to<BR>get acclimated and comfortable with what is trying<BR>to say and do, and how he approaches it, but just <BR>then, he kicks it in gear and whisks you away to a<BR>world of magical characters where Robbin's strange<BR>laws of metaphysics hold true. If you haven't read<BR>Robbins yet, dive right in; you will be surprised.<BR>If you have read Robbins before and did not find <BR>him to be enjoyable, this book will not change your mind.
Tom Robbins is a very seductive writer. I picked up the book<BR>and rather begrudgingly let him suck me into the absurd <BR>world which he created. After the second day, I was<BR>hooked. He is that rare type of writer who doesn't need<BR>to hide behind needlessly complicated language in order<BR>to explore man's deeper issues. He is so disarming that<BR>the reader barely notices the physic intrusion. A must<BR>read for younger writers,especially if you are a redhead.
This book is Keroauc sitting in on a mean late night<BR>jazz jam session, writing and reciting verse while all<BR>those around him are blowing madly. It is very<BR>different from the mainstream Keroauc where he <BR>talks about writing in this style. This book is the<BR>style as it spins a story in and out of the rhealm of<BR>the waking consciousness and reminds me of the way I<BR>feel like after listening to some classic Miles.<BR>Read this book and let in linger in your mind for a <BR>while, it has that kind of depth to it.
This book provides the reader with the best chance of<BR>exploring the roots of Kerouac's spitituality. Far too<BR>often the beats are viewed as a bunch of intellectual<BR>hedonists whose love for verse was equalled only<BR>by their indulgence in the various permetations of<BR>chemical abuse. The beats set the stage for the 60's,<BR>and America's search for a true a national spirituality.<BR>As &quot;King of the Beats&quot;, Kerouac takes the reader into an<BR>in depth analysis of what lay at the very heart of the <br />beat movement-the journey is the reward in and of itself.
Kerouac is at his best when he writes of his adentures amongst<br />the downtrodden people of misfortune. It is as if these<br />experiences cleanse away the pores through which his soul<br />breathes. For those of you who may only of read &quot;On the Road&quot;,<br />this book will awaken you to the depths of this great writer's<br />being. It is a must read for those of you who are<br />exloring his writings.
Steinbeck is one of my all time favorite writers. This book is a fitting curtain call to an illustrious career. Steinbeck had a deep love for the common man, for the misfits and socially shackled, and spent a lifetime spinning tales about their trials and tribulations. Yet, he remained so humble despite all the struggles he had endeared to become an &quot;accomplished&quot; writer. The language in this book is a joy to read and I would strongly encourage any young writers to give it a read.
Steinbeck has a way of telling a tale of the<BR>comman man which breathes life into the mythos<BR>which support our culture. America has long had<BR>an affinity for the exploits of those who live<BR>on it's fringes. The drifters, the con men, the<BR>dreamers and searchers doomed to anonymity were <BR>it not for the likes of authors such as Steinbeck.<BR>This is a simple tale, but told so well it can be<BR>read again and again...
I must admit that I don't read a lot of historical fiction,<BR>but on a friend's advice, I picked up this book and found it<BR>to be an interesting read. As a writer, I always am amazed when<BR>an author can reconstruct a past world and set a story in motion<BR>which draws the reader into it. Armed with only word, there are<BR>some very talented authors of this genre. Cornwell certainly is one of them.
I had read Cannery Row in college and loved it so much that I could never read this book. One day a friend of mine left it behind and I started to read it. Two hours later, I was back in Steinbeck land, laughing at the antics of the Cannery Row<BR>gang. What a glorious sequel. The lost art of the novella was resurrected in these two books by Steinbeck.
I picked up the book because I heard that Ms. Johnson<BR>hung out with Kerouac in the time right before his<BR>writing hit big. I was looking for her take on it all.<BR>This book surprised me because it is so well written.<BR>She provides an excellent insight as to the struggles <BR>which the female beat writers faced. I would recommend <BR>this to any young aspiring female writers.
It was interesting hearing about Kerouac &amp; Cassady<BR>from a woman's point of view, especially a woman who<BR>was so intimately connected to the dynamic duo. She<BR>dwelt on the negative ramifications a bit too much for<BR>my taste, but then again, these have never been really <BR>examined in much detail prior to this books release. <BR>For those of you who have at least a passing interest<BR>in the beats, I would recommend this book.
The author has been generally ignored as to his place <BR>in the formative years of Beat-O-Roma, and this book <BR>becomes a good background check on his impressive<BR>&quot;credentials&quot;. He certainly can't write with that <BR>jazz laced pen which Keroauc used to set the tone<BR>of beat writings, but his story really sheds a lot <BR>of light upon the struggles which this anarcistic<BR>movement bestowed upon its followers.<BR>All in all, if you like beat culture you <BR>will probabley find this to be an enjoyable read.
Ms. Charters did a commenable job putting together<BR>this book. I would rate it right up there with<BR>Nicosia's bio. The author certainly provided a lot<BR>of background info and did a compelling job of<BR>helping me get a better understanding of the social<BR>climate which Kerouac &amp; friends had to contend with<BR>and conquer. My only complaint is that her writing style<BR>sometimes lapses into a style a little too closely allied<BR>with that of her subject, but given the subject matter, that is<br />understandable. I would recommend this book for those of <BR>you who have found Kerouac's writings to be enjoyable.
The author sheds light on a side of the beat culture<BR>which has been ignored by the mass media for far too<BR>long. Many a word has been written about the Beat's<BR>frontal attack upon the sleepy surburban world of <BR>America circa late 1950s, but few have bottered to<BR>examine their spiritual awareness as related to Mother<BR>Earth. They were fresh voices who found spiritual<BR>rebirth through nature and were in the forefront of<BR>those questioning the prevalent doctrine of consummerism.<BR>I would heartily recommend this well written book.
This book features a great collection of photographs<BR>documenting Kerouac and his circle of acquitances<BR>spanning an impressive length of time. I would have liked<BR>the author to have spent a little bit more time<BR>exploring Kerouac's spiritual side, as oppossed to the media<BR>orientated recitation of random incidents, but I <BR>understand for it is the latter which pushes book exposure<BR>and sales. Still, it was a book which I would encourage<BR>others to read.
Let me tell you a story. I had just come down to<BR>San Francisco after a couple of years of bumming <BR>around the Great Northwest. It was a Monday morning<BR>and I had picked up a newspaper; bound and determined<BR>to scour the want ads until I found prospects for an<BR>honest job, with the full intention of becoming more<BR>respectful. I went to a cafe in North Beach and had a <BR>seat at one of the outdoor tables. As I began to unfold<BR>the newspaper, I noticed that someone had left a copy <BR>of &quot;Desolation Angels&quot; on the chair. I picked it up and <BR>started to read it. Several hours later I abandoned my<BR>faint tries at redemption and walked over to Washington<BR>Square to work on some poetry. The man can flat out write.<BR>That's why they call him the King of the Beats.
In this novel Keroauc starts to explore the possibilty<BR>that he had become a victim of the caricature which he<BR>had invented and chosen to portray. Inspired by Jack<BR>London, he invented this personna whose disquise<BR>he proudly modeled, forgetting the Zen imperative of<BR>quiet detachment. He had painted himself into the<BR>proverbal corner and the beautiful anquish laddened <BR>writing exposes the pain this awareness instilled in him.<BR>Let the world remember him for &quot;On the Road&quot;, this book<BR>is the one which I would choose to read in order to tap<BR>into the realizations which he had made in his waning years.
This book is a must read for those of you<BR>who ever wondered where the hippie movement<BR>of the 60's in the Haight got its start. As <BR>excellently chronicled by a young Tom Wolfe,<BR>the beats of the 50's planted the seeds of what <BR>was to become the psychedelic movement. The<BR>thing I like about the beats was that they were <BR>a bunch of intelligentia who made no bones about<BR>the fact that they totally rejected the Eisenhower<BR>50's mentality which held America under siege.<BR>Wolfe does a fine job of emphasizing the theatrics<BR>of the Merry Pranksters. These were more than<BR>a bunch of druged out drifters, these were people<BR>on a mission to spread awareness: to help awaken America <BR>from it's post war slumber. &quot;Go with the flow&quot;: now <BR>there's a motto to live by!
This book is a perfect introduction to the magic<BR>of Kerouac. If you have never read this book,<BR>you owe it to the collective consciousness<BR>to do so. Kerouac has an amazing ability<BR>with language. Words kind of dance for him.<BR>If you haven't read this book in a while,<BR>then you owe it to yourself to give it another<BR>read. I have always considered this book to be a<BR>dear friend from an author who inspired me to <BR>become a writer.
To those of you who have only read &quot;On the<BR>Road&quot;, you need to read this book. Kerouac<BR>made great strides as a writer after<BR>he wrote his first book. This book is a close as<BR>Kerouac ever got to emulating a fine blowing<BR>jazz piece. Personally, this book introduced me<BR>to Zen and has sparked a life long interest in<BR>its pursuit.
I think that this book represents some of his<BR>best sensually laced writing. The whole book <BR>ozes with a sexual tension between his two main <BR>characters. Having lived for a long time<BR>in North Beach, I loved his use and description<BR>of this bohemian enclave.
This book was a struggle until I reached the <BR>second part of the story. Ms Diamant shines <BR>from this point on. I have recommended it to several <BR>friends despite the slow start.
If you have read any of his prior work, you<BR>will want to pick up his latest offering.<BR>This man has a great way with words and<BR>can certainly weave a good story.
Carl Hiaasen is a very good writer who has shown once again that <BR>he can spin a good tale, filled with well developed characters<BR>and spiced with some insightful humor. I do like the way that he<BR>utilized the first person point of view for this book.<BR>There is nothing ground breaking<BR>in this book,but there are several hours<BR>of very enjoyable reading.
I think that this is Ken Follett's best work in <BR>a long time. Some critics have claimed that he <BR>has been very overrated, but this book shows<BR>what a master craftsmen can do within the context<BR>of a bizare storyline. This book is a must read<BR>for fans of this genre of writing.
I enjoyed  this book. I too am a lttle leary of a book<BR>which has all the PR vehicles of the industry behind it.<BR>The book did have some slow moments, but on the whole <BR>Mr. Franzen's writing style was strong enough to carry<BR>me through to a well structured ending. It was nice to<BR>be put under the spell of a very fine writer.
I thought Ms. Freethy did an excellent job of<br />character development while weaving an intricate<br />storyline. I think that this book proves that<br />she has become a very polished writer.
I read these back in college, but had never forgotten their magic. I recently gave this set to my young daughter and she<br />quickly emersed herself headlong into the beautiful and bewitching world which Tolkien creates for the reader. Do<br />the same for your young ones!
I thoroughly enjoyed this collection. You can quibble<BR>about which authors or stories were omitted, but I <BR>found it be a very valuable resource in terms of single<BR>sourcing an excellent variety of work. When I was <BR>a &quot;budding&quot; writer, short stories were my main source<BR>of inspirational reading. I learned a lot about point of<BR>view, plot development and character analysis from <BR>some of the masters of the craft. I also became acquainted<BR>with scores of new writers seeking to make an impact in the<BR>litery world. I would highly recommend this collection <BR>of short stories
This is an excellent audio and video compilation<BR>of a wide variety of very interesting poets. As a poet,<BR>I have often wondered what a particular poem would<BR>sound like when voiced by its author. How would they<BR>have read it? How did the poet want the phrases <BR>puntcuated? I would heartily recommend this collection<BR>for poets and nonpoets alike.
This is an excellent read! Victoria has a way of drawing you into the world which she creates within her book. She has a seductive way with words which kept my attention focused on the characters througout the story. My only question is when is the sequel coming? I would highly recommend this book.
