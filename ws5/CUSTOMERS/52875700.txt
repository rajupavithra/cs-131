The Irish have long memories, and even longer tales to reflect that.  This book is a wonderful way to get children caught up in the excitement and tension of a classical tale, while also giving them a resourceful and modern heroine to admire.  The book is everything a children's story should be: it's funny, the languish reads well and beautifully, and the illustrations are well done.  This is a must-have.
A standard seminary textbook, McBeth's comprehensive treatment of the various groups that share a common &quot;baptist&quot; identity is an accesible read for laypeople as well. If you've ever wondered what a &quot;hardshell&quot; baptist was, or what made &quot;primitive baptists&quot; different, this is the book for you. In addition, McBeth does an excellent job of helping baptists to understand how our own theological journey connects with that of the larger Christian church.
Bradley is undeniably one of the great craftspeople of fantastic settings; and her strong female characters are always a refereshing change from the  status quo.<br />I would not, however, consider Gravelight to be one of her  more stellar achievements.  Although the story line is engrossing, the  characters are just a little too stereotypical and the theology/magic  system a tad too clich&eacute;d.  The ending, likewise, is somewhat predictable  and pat.<br />Were it most other author, this book would have received 3  stars.  Nevertheless, the Bradley touches (particularly the emphasisi on  the female characters) are sufficient to make this a respectable read for  anyone who enjoys the genre.  As always, Bradley manages to make you want  to read to the end; even if you are pretty what that will be.
Worship is meant to be meaning-full.  Every word, pause, and action is (or should be) intentional and holy.  Dawn invites the reader into (an  admittedly one-sided conversation) that reminds the reader of the  sacredness of a gathered community of faith; and persuasively argues for  the preservation of the rich tradition of Christian worship.<br />Passionate  proponents of &quot;contemporary&quot; worship will at the very least find  points of disagreement.  In fact, they may very well be offended.  Nevertheless, this excellent book is a much needed and well-researched  counter to the current trend towards assuming that traditional worship has  no connection or meaning to contemporary culture.<br />I highly recommend this  book to anyone planning, contemplating, or participating in Christian  worship in any form or denominational tradition.  Warning: It may very well  change things you have believed for a long time.
Deus Ex is a complex game.  In fact, I didn't realize just how complex it was until I started reading this strategy guide and saw how many subtle options I had missed.  Unlike many of the Prima guides which tend to be a  little anemic in the &quot;actuallly useful information&quot; department; I  found this guide to be absolutely PACKED with helpful tips and clues.  Deus  Ex is almost a different experience with this by my side.<br />I highly  recommend this book for anyone who wants to get the most out of the game  but who (sadly) cannot play it through two or three times to accomplish  that goal.
I was first inroduced to this compilation in a graduate survey course on composition theory.  The articles started my love affair with the discipline; a tumultuous relationship that has caused me to completely  redefine my graduate interests.<br />Composition theory has evolved through a  number of distinct stages over the past few decades; and Villanueva has  effectively zeroed in on the key figures and key articles from each period.  If you are new to composition theory, these essays will provide you with a  solid roadmap through the landscape of rhetorical theory.<br />If you've  been down that road a few times; Villanueva's resource is an excellent  refresher course.  The editorial choices do not seem to reflect any  particular bias.  The essays themselves represent many different sides of  each school of thought; and are the authors' own words.  It is left to the  reader then to sift through the particular biases and assumtions of each  school of thought.<br />This book has my highest recommendation for anyone  with any interest in the field.  For all but the most sagacious, I would  consider it a must-have.
If you pulled up this title you probably have some interest in studying Bibilical Hebrew.  If you plan on buying only one reference tool for those studies, this should be it.  The contextual references and translations  (although somewhat dated) are extensive and detailed.  The The lexicography  is the standard used or referenced by all of the other works in the field.  The historical information is extremely useful if you plan on doing  comparative work or focused eymologies.<br />This is the single masterwork  reference for Biblical Hebrew; and, if you are a seminary student, you will  probably have to buy it anyway.
This is a top-notch biblical reference and a must-have for your language shelf.  Obviously, you don't want to become too dependent on it; but it can certainly get you out of a bind when you are stuck in a corner.
If you don't mind the British English slant, this is an excellent dictionary (and FAR superior to its abridged cousins).  I do prefer the Simon and Schuster's for more technical and precise translation; but this  is nevertheless an excellent dictionary which will not dissapoint you.
This is perhaps the ultimate reference tool for an experienced programmer who wishes to push Visual Basic to its limits.  The book is carefully laid out, well indexed, and quite detailed.  I highly recommend it.
Here Silverberg offers us the chance to experience first-person vignettes from across the thousands of years of Majipoor's history.  Silverberg does an outstanding job of making historical personages come alive in such a way  that, when you encounter oblique references to them in later novels you  feel as if someone has just mentioned an old friend.<br />In addition,  Silverberg takes you behind the scenes at some of the pivotal moments in  Majipoor's past.  He crafts those events with insight and cleverness (and  throws in a few surprises).  The complicated and seductive world of  Majipoor is even more so after the glimpses which Silverberg  offers.<br />Every story in this collection would stand alone as an enjoyable  and thought-provoking reading experience.  Together, they are a must-have  for fans and non-fans alike.
Majipoor is a big place - a really, REALLY, big place; and Robert Silverberg has peopled it with a diverse and intriguing population of non-humans and humans.  In this first novel set in that world (with a  Science Fiction History but an essentially Fantasy present); Silverberg  takes you on an exciting, fast-paced trek through its diverse  environs.<br />Although only Valentine is well-developed, the characters are  certainly sympathetic and the storyline is quite engrossing.  The sheer  diversity of the planet, and the thoughtful way in which Silverberg has  layed out the planet's history and social geography, make this a fun and  thought-provoking read.<br />If they are not there already, _Lord Valentine's  Castle_ and the world of Majipoor are destined for &quot;classic&quot;  status.  It is deserved.  They are both well worth the time that you will  spend exploring them.
Picture a sculpture of stunning complexity and beauty.  Then imagine someone taking a picture of it.  The first person who sees the picture holds tracing paper over it and traces the outline of the visible side of  the sculpture.  Realizing that what they have is only a pale imitation of  the original, the sketcher throws their work onto the ground, where the  image becomes partially obscured by mud.  A passerby takes a polaroid of  that partially obscured sketch.<br />If the rich tradition of Jewish and  Christian prophecy is the sculpture, then LaHaye and Jenkins' book is the  polaroid.<br />Speaking as a Christian clergyman, the theology and biblical  interpretation in _Left Behind_ is infantile and absurd.  Speaking as a  lover of books, the characterization is so limp and one-dimensional that it  was a chore to keep reading.<br />_Left Behind_ is an excellent propoganda  tool for those who wish to turn Christianity into the kind of self-serving,  ignorant, spiritually bankrupt institution that it is portrayed to be in  the media.  It is also an excellent tool for convincing people to read the  powerful and mysterious texts of the Bible as if they were a contemporary  (bad) novel.<br />If you are a Christian (or interested in Christianity); do  not go near this book. Please, Please, PLEASE seek out reliable, scholarly  commentaries on Revelation (such as the one in the New Interpreter's Bible  series).<br />If you are looking for an engrossing, clever, &quot;what  if?&quot; novel; look elsewhere.
When I was working as an Army linguist, this was widely regarded as the most complete Spanish-English dictionary.  Its entries are comprehensive, with excellent examples of contextual usage and thorough  treatment of idiomatic usage.  It is well worth every penny for a linguist with a solid grounding in basic vocabulary.
Most people understand that the study of Scripture is an enormous task;  and that there is a considerable theological heritage to even the most  benign of passages.  Unfortunately, it is sometimes difficult to translate  that understanding into a willingness to genuinely delve into the vast pool  of material out there.  In addition, it's hard to know whom to trust.<br /><br />You  can trust the New Interpreter's Bible series.  All of the scholars who  contributed are the best in their field.  In addition, the layout (which  includes two complete translations - the NIV and the NRSV) is conducive to  both scholarly and spiritual study of the texts.<br /><br />Each text is broken down  into discrete units followed by general commentary  on the passage, verse by vers analysis of key issues, and then an overview  of study questions.  The commentators address issues of authorship,  historical setting, translation, theological history, and personal  application.  In addition, they graciously point to excellent sources for further reading.<br /><br />Speaking as a pastor, it is my strong opinion that every  English-speaking Christian who is serious about Bible study should own the complete set.
I carried a Revised English Bible with me through all three years of  seminary; and constantly compared it to the Greek and Hebrew texts.  Although it is not the most precise, literal translation (here I would lean  towards the New Revised Standard because of my personal dislike for the  scholarship behind the New American Standard), the sense of language and  poetry in the REB is far superior to any reliable translation.  For this  reason, the REB is the translation that I read from the pulpit.<br />The  scholarly articles and footnotes in the Oxford edition are top-notch;  although they have a decidedly Anglican flavor in places they are generally  ecumenical and quite informative.  If you were to only have one study  Bible, this is the one I would recommend.
Kay's prose is, as always, lovely and engrossing.  His detailed recreation  (and slight warping) of Byzantine life is engrossing, and thought  provoking.  Both Sarantium books (and if you read one you will have to read  the other) would be worthwhile reading for that alone.<br />Kay's approach to  his character's relationships, however, adds an additional layer to these  two wonderful books.  Don't expect to predict how the romances and  friendships will play out in the long run.  As in real life, the intimacies  and and antagonisms in the Sarantium books are complex and  ever-changing.<br />Additionally, Kay's preference for telling events from all  sides, although sometimes a little tedious, is overall an engrossing device  which drew me completely into the world of Sarantium.<br />Both books are well  worth your time; and the characters are well worth your affection.

OK, I admit it, I'm a reference book geek.  I love to have as much information crammed into the smallest space possible.  The Order of Things does just that, and it does it exponentially well.  This is an invaluable  reference for anyone who wants to know &quot;How is X related to Y&quot; or  &quot;Which of these is better, older, more important...&quot;  Any trivia,  history, or fact buff would love to find this under their birthday wrapping  paper.
I love portraits.  I like to see how complex and how powerful and how beautiful we can be as humans.  I love to see histories and hopes etched into people's faces and bodies.  _Women Before 10 A.M._ successfully and  repeatedly evoked these kinds of powerful emotions in me.  I would have  bought it at twice the price.
If you think that the reason Christians should oppose homosexuality is \\"because the Bible says it's wrong\\" then, you should buy this book.  One of my seminary professors recommended this book to me while I  was an M.Div. student, and I have recommended it to many others since.  Scroggs does an excellent job of introducing the reader to basic prinicples  of biblical interpretation and then applying those principles to the (very  few) verses that seem to address homosexuality.<br /><br />If you have any biblical  questions on this issue, this is the book to start with.  It's starting to get a bit dated now, but it is still a great way to grasp the basic concept that the biblical writers were not addressing the issue of loving, consensual, monogamous, healthy relationships between adults of the same sex.
This book belongs in any library of Jewish folklore.  The stories are well-written and delightful; and often provide a new spin on a familiar tale.  Excerpted (and cited, of course) they make excellent anecdotes.  Woven together, they provide a sense of the rich and vivid tapestry that  comprises Jewish folktales.  Sometimes irreverent, sometimes poignant, and  always real; there is something for everyone here.
If you continue to question the assumptions and easy answers that seemed to make so much sense as a child, this is an excellent book to guide you through that journey.  I first encountered _The Openness of God_ in  seminary, and have since referred to it on several occasions as I have  sought cogent explanations for reconciling some of the tougher issues of  faith.<br /><br />I doubt that you will find much in common with the book if you are  a fundamentalist or \\"conservative evangelical\\" Christian; but I  do not think that this is its target audience.  For the educated,  questioning, perhaps believer; however, this is an excellent choice.
There are many delightful aspects to this well-written work.  Its most stunning quality is its clever, complex, and detailed look at first contact and the intricacies of a truly alien civilization.  In addition, the  carefully crafted characterization drew me in immediately.  I found that I  came to care very deeply for the characters, and I took their pains and  tribulations quite personally.<br />This is well-thought-out, well-written  science fiction at its best.
Dr. Duke, working under the mentoring of Alan Culpepper, has written a concientous, thorough, and fascinating analysis of a key pattern in the John's Gospel: Irony. This popular literary device permeates the fourth  gospel, and is fundamental to the dualistic themes found throughout the  work. Dr. Duke's research provides an essential schematic whereby the  novice or the scholar can navigate the complexities of this gospel. Dr.  Duke looks at the book with the eye of a trained scholar and the heart of a  lyrical poet.
If you've ever felt that Christianity as you've heard it only told one (very patriarchal) side of the story; Kidd wants you to know that you are not alone.  The emotions that this book arouses are so powerful (and  sometimes painful) that you may only want to take it in small doses.  Whatever your pace, however, I think that you will find the journey  worthwhile.<br /><br />One approach to spirituality that is often associated with the feminist movement is an emphasis  on the personal.  Unsurprisingly, then, Kidd takes us on HER journey rather  then that of a more abstract and impersonal third person.  In connecting  Kidd's story to my own, I found a kind of hope and encouragement that can  only come from meeting a kindred spirit on a long road.<br /><br />Man or woman,  your or old, this book is a must-have.  It will challenge you, make you  angry, and open up new worlds for you - if you let it.
It's a tough question.  Three years of rigorous Christian seminary is still not enough to convince me that they go to Hell.  It's nice to know that Knitter and Hick feel the same way.  If you are looking for a cogent,  scholarly approach to the kind of pluralism that most of us accept  logically but have trouble defending theologically, this is the book to  buy.  In addition, its bibliography is outstanding.
Crossan's work is a complex and thorough approach to the Jesus material in the New Testament, as well as to the socio-political period in which Jesus lived.  In his preface, Crossan clearly outlines the assumptions that  undergird his understanding of both; and I would caution any reader to keep  those assumptions in mind.  Taking that caveat into account, however, this  is a brilliant magnum opus by an outstanding scholar; but one that will  take considerable effort for someone not already familiar with the field to  understand.
Part whodunit and part sci-fi, Infinity Beach is a fun and engrossing read.  Sometimes the logic seems a bit slippery and the characters a little flat; but the main character is sufficiently sympathetic to guide you  through the book.  If you are looking for a &quot;hard&quot; sci-fi account  of first contact, try _A Deepness in the Sky_.  If you want more of a noir  detective novel on the same topic; this is the book for you.
