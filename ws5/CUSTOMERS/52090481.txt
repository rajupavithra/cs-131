Aside from people who just plain hate Shakespeare (and I don't get them at ALL), there are two types of Shakespeare Snobs.  1. The ones who think Shakespeare couldn't have written his plays because he wasn't born to nobility.  These people are idiots.  2. The ones who idolize Shakespeare to the point where, if they don't like one of his plays, He Obviously Couldn't Have Written It -- he is incapable of writing something they don't like.  Um... right.  Let's apply this rationale to a latter day artist: since Charlie Chaplin made \\"The Gold Rush\\", he obviously had nothing to do with \\"A King in New York.\\" <br /> <br />Geniuses grow and change with everything they do.  The Beatles of \\"A Hard Day's Night\\" are not the Beatles of \\"A Day in the Life.\\"  Shakespeare spent his career shifting with the tides of what was Currently Popular.  If he had lived in the mid 1970's, he would have followed a \\"Five Easy Pieces\\" with a \\"Star Wars\\".  He rolled with the flow, but stamped his own creativity on every work.  \\"Pericles\\" and the other later romances were written because that's what the current popular genre was.  Box office dictated form; artistry dictated content. <br /> <br />Having recently read \\"Pericles\\", I have to say that it's one of the best, wackiest plays ever written.  (I also think \\"Measure for Measure\\" is meant to be darkly funny, not brooding and angsty; but that's just me.)  \\"Pericles\\" is what would happen if the writer of the Hee Haw \\"Gloom, Despair and Agony on Me\\" song had decided to make a Hope and Crosby Road picture.  Unlike Shakespeare's tragic heroes and their Fatal Flaws, Pericles is just a poor schmuck (who happens to be a king) upon whom Murphy's Law comes down like a 50 pound hammer.  EVERYTHING happens to this poor guy; your jaw drops at his second or third consecutive shipwreck. <br /> <br />The opening scene alone is worth the price of admission.  Pericles has to guess the answer to the riddle of a very John Cleesian king.  If he guesses right, he marries the princess.  If he guesses wrong, he dies.  Unfortunately, he guesses the right answer -- that the king is screwing his own daughter -- and he can't possibly say it out loud.  He'll be killed if he answers and killed if he doesn't.  It's a very Ralph Kramden hummena-hummena-hummena moment. <br /> <br />And the Act IV brothel scenes, where Pericles' daughter Marina has been sold into prostitution, are among the funniest scenes Shakespeare ever wrote.  She doesn't just hold onto her virginity -- every male who tries to do her is coverted to the path of righteousness and the brothel is losing its shirt. <br /> <br />Nevertheless, you feel for the characters even while laughing at the outlandish sheer enormity of each new disaster; Bambi getting killed isn't funny.  Bambi getting squashed by Godzilla is hysterical.  The reconciliation scene is one of Shakespeare's most affecting. <br /> <br />If you like quirkiness, this is a wonderful play.

After &quot;MASH&quot; &amp; &quot;MASH Goes to Maine,&quot; Richard Hooker &quot;took on a collaborator&quot;, William E. Butterworth, for a series of &quot;MASH Goes to...&quot; books.<br />The first two MASH books are basically collections of short stories with a very loose structure.  The Butterworth books are sitcom novels... and not very good ones.<br />After the Butterworth series was played out, Hooker released &quot;MASH Mania,&quot; which was a loosely structured series of short stories about the Swampmen in middle-age -- a rock-ribbed Republican middle-age, in fact, amazing though that may be to fans of the TV series, which Hooker hated.  Although this book has politics opposite to my own, it's still funny and more importantly, Hooker WROTE IT.<br />From the completely different writing styles involved, I'd say that if Hooker ever even SAW what Butterworth wrote, it was to say, &quot;Yeah, ok.  I'll approve that.&quot;<br />I like Hooker's writing; so I felt rather manipulated by the Butterworth MASH books, which to my mind are Hooker's in name only.

This is more a review of the sample presentation on this page, since it is supposed to entice the reader into buying the book.  I'm a person who was looking forward to buying the book and now I have my doubts.    Books cost a lot of money.  While I'll put up with the sloppy grammar and spelling which are the spice of life for internet writers, if I pay for a book I expect decent proofreading.  What is on the front flyleaf?  In discussing Hiken's greatest creation, Sgt. Bilko, the editor allows the author to misspell \\"Sergeant.\\"  Three times.  On the flyleaf, which is supposed to dazzle us.    And then Amazon compounds the sloppiness.  In going through the sample pages, I find that pages 7 & 8 aren't even from this book.    Some people claim that demanding literacy and correct spelling from authors and editors is excessive.  Well -- they probably wouldn't say \\"excessive\\"; they'd say it was \\"sucky\\".  Or \\"suckee\\", if they wanted to be exotic.  These people make my jaw drop.    I gave three stars because it's not fair to rate a book high or low when you haven't read it yet.    *******  Since writing the above, I've read the book.  It's worth the three stars I gave it.  It's pretty good; worth reading.  But just because there IS a book on a hitherto uncovered topic doesn't automatically mean it's a GOOD book.
Some of the other reviewers criticize Goldman for expressing strong opinions.  Personally, I would prefer reading a strong opinion with which I might disagree to being spoonfed crap that I supposedly Want To Hear.  I *love* strong opinions.  Goldman wrote a Clint Eastwood movie that didn't become a classic, so How Dare He Dislike &quot;Saving Private Ryan&quot;?  So, &quot;Absolute Power&quot; wipes out &quot;The Princess Bride&quot; and &quot;Butch Cassidy&quot;?  And if he writes a mediocre movie, his opinions about what makes a movie good are no longer valid?<br />This is akin to what a book reviewer came up with when James Cagney wrote that one of the finest actresses he'd ever worked with was Doris Day.  The reviewer raked Cagney over the coals for that, forgetting that (A) Doris Day was damned good in &quot;Love Me or Leave Me&quot; with Cagney and (B) Cagney was certainly a better judge of whom he liked to work with than the reviewer.  Cagney was talking about Day's talent and potential; the reviewer only saw &quot;Pillow Talk&quot; glazing in front of his eyes.  Opinions from professionals like Cagney or Goldman may be disagreed with, but certainly not dismissed.<br />This book is highly recommended, both for its extremely fun anecdotes and especially for the screenwriting tutorial, which is blessed with abundant common sense.  As an aspiring screenwriter, my goal after reading this book is to study the breeziness, the flow of Goldman's storytelling and find a way to apply it to my own voice.  If you are a movie fan, buy this book.  If you want to write screenplays, buy two copies, one for the shelf and one you can mark up with hi-liter pens and post-it notes.
I've been reading \\"Monkey Business,\\" the other new Marx Brothers biography purchased from Amazon, and \\"Groucho\\" caught my eye in local bookstore.<br />It took me one brief browse to put it back on the shelf,  unpurchased.<br />There is a description of Groucho's detestation for Humphrey  Bogart after seeing him belt his wife in public.  This was Bogart's  \\"first wife, Virginia Mayo.\\"<br />Virginia Mayo?<br />Virginia Mayo was  a good actress who came to prominence in the forties, several years after  the quoted anecdote took place.  I assume the author meant Bogart's third  wife, Mayo Methot.<br />If the author can't get the facts straight about one  of Hollywood's greatest icons, are we supposed to trust anything he says  about the lesser-known people surrounding his biographical topic?<br />How  slipshod can you get?
It was coincidental that two of my Christmas presents were books by the director (Alan Rafkin) and star (Don Knotts) of \\"The Ghost and Mr. Chicken\\".  And I had the same reaction to both books:  Interesting but  skimpy, apparently designed to be quick, light reads (I finished both of them within a day and a half).<br />I'm beginning to suspect that this is an editing  problem rather than an authorial one.  Perhaps the publishers don't think  we'd sit still for longer, more detailed books.  I wanted more insight into  their worlds and the people with whom they worked.<br />For instance, Knotts  never mentions his participation in \\"It's a Mad Mad Mad Mad  World,\\" one of the most misbegotten movies ever released.  Imagine the  scene: Phil Silvers, master con-man, is teamed for a brief while with Don  Knotts, nervous rube.  That's *brilliant* casting... and it didn't go  anywhere.  It would be interesting to learn *why* things like that  happened.<br />Two stories heard elsewhere:<br />A producer came to Andy Griffith  and Don Knotts with a sitcom pilot script.  When Griffith found that the  script was standard '80's insult humor, he wanted nothing to do with it.   Knotts tried to convince him that they could fix it.  \\"I know we  can,\\" replied Andy.  \\"But why get into bed with this man when he  doesn't understand the relationship?\\"<br />Or this: After screening  \\"The Ghost and Mr. Chicken\\", studio execs came up with the  brilliant idea of *showing* the guy who yelled \\"Attaboy, Luther.\\"   Knotts put his foot down (reportedly *very* adamently) and the classic bit  remained unspoiled.<br />Call me greedy, but I find those kind of stories  insightful and I wanted more of them.  Tell us about having a Playboy  centerfold for your leading lady (which had to be a big deal in 1965), or  about the sketch on the Smothers Brothers Comedy Hour with Leigh French,  filled with drug references and sexual innuendoes (and one of the funniest  sketches I have ever seen.)<br />Talk about refusing to speak to the press  during the filming of \\"Return to Mayberry\\", one of the most  justified snubbings in TV history.  For twenty years, the press couldn't be  bothered with Don Knotts.  As soon as he was back in the niche *they*  wanted, they were swarming for interviews -- which he didn't grant and who  can blame him?<br />It's a likable book, but for me it was like having three  good potato chips.  I wanted more.
I'm very much a fan of Eric Idle's, so I ordered this book from Amazon.com the second I saw it listed.  *Sigh.*  The problem here is that \\"The Road to Mars\\" wants to be three things: a comic sci-fi novel, a  story-within-a-story and a dissertation on comedy.  The blend doesn't work.  <BR><BR> As a comic sci-fi novel, it clearly wants to follow in the  footsteps of the first couple of \\"Hitchhiker's\\" books by Douglas  Adams.  Those first books were adaptations of a radio series.  The plots  crackled along and the books were hilarious.  It was when Adams decided to  become a Novelist rather than an Adapter of his radio work that the books  became flabby.  The story of \\"The Road to Mars\\" doesn't hold up  as well as the worst of the \\"Hitchhikers\\" books.  None of the  characters acts as a driving force.  The plot just becomes tedious.  <BR><BR> The framework story, about Professor Bill Reynolds, a  micropaleontologist seduced by the possibility of fame and fortune if only  he can steal the story he's telling, is pretty good.  Reynolds is probably  the most developed character in the book, which is unfortunate in that he's  only the narrator. <BR><BR> If Idle had written a book solely about the  meaning and history of comedy & comedians, I would have bought that.   He obviously has a lot to say on the topic; it just doesn't really mesh  with the other half of the book. *And* he proceeds from a faulty premise.   He divides comics into two categories of circus clowns: Whiteface and  Rednose.  He then shoehorns a lot of comedians into the sections and claims  that the theory applies universally.  \\"Try it yourself.\\"  The  trouble is, it *doesn't* apply universally. <BR><BR> Circus comedy is  divided into four components, not two: the Whiteface, the Auguste (Idle's  Rednose), the Tramp and the Ringmaster.  The Whiteface is the ringleader,  the wiseguy, the troublemaker.  The Auguste is a lovable, dopey stooge who  usually ends up taking the pie aimed at the Whiteface; he's thepoor sap  who just can't win.  The Tramp is the lowest of the low, but with an innocence that usually deflects any pies aimed at him onto the Auguste (who  is the complete fall-guy) or even the Whiteface.  Frequently silent, the  Tramp is the most childlike Clown and occasionally exhibits magical  qualities.  The Ringmaster is the Boss, the Enemy, the bombastic official  who tries ineffectually to reign over the Clowns. <BR><BR> According to  Idle, Stan Laurel is a Whiteface.  He's actually a Tramp.  Oliver Hardy is  an Auguste, James Finlayson, Mae Busch, etc. are their Ringmasters and the  world is their Whiteface. <BR><BR> According to Idle, Phil Silvers (Sgt.  Bilko) is an Auguste.  Wrong.  Bilko is the Whiteface, Ritzik & Grover  are the Augustes, Doberman is a Tramp and Colonel Hall is the Ringmaster.  <BR><BR> Idle can't place Rowan Atkinson as Mr. Bean -- a silent,  resourceful brat of a child.  Mr. Bean is a Tramp.  Atkinson's first  \\"Blackadder\\" had three Augustes: Edmund, Percy & Baldrick.   The series became much more successful when they changed: Edmund as the  Whiteface, Percy (later George) as the Auguste, Baldrick as the Tramp and  Queen Elizabeth & Colonel Melchett as dangerously insane Ringmasters.  <BR><BR> Moe: Whiteface.  Larry: Auguste.  Curly: Tramp.<BR>Vernon Dent,  Bud Jamison: Ringmasters.<BR><BR> Groucho: Whiteface.  Chico: Auguste.   Harpo: Tramp.<BR>Margaret Dumont: Ringmaster.<BR><BR> W.C. Fields  (con-man): Whiteface.  W.C. Fields (suburbanite): Auguste.  W.C. Fields  (silent juggler): Tramp.<BR><BR> I wouldn't carp so much, but Idle builds  much of his comedic foundation on the \\"Two Clown\\" theory, and  it's an erroneous one... which wouldn't be so bad if the rest of the book  were good enough to take up the slack.  But Idle seems far more interested  in the comedic theories than the story.  I am, too, frankly.  It would have  been a better book if he had left out the plot. <BR><BR> Even so, if you  have a choice between Steve Allen'spontificating books on comedy (F=TS/56,  the theory that everything funny originated on the \\"Tonight Show\\"  when Steve Allen hosted) and this book, take \\"The Road to Mars.\\"
