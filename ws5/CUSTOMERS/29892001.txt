Michael Romkey is the kind of writer that you really want to see succeed. Having read all of his books to date, I think he is two thirds of the way there; in that his style of writing is very good and he does introduce fresh and unique scenarios and concepts into his novels. However, other than &quot;I, Vampire&quot;, there seems to be a lack of captivation with the books. By that I mean that at any point in his books, I could put it down and never pick it up again. To be fair though, I have never done that.<br />In this novel, the story unfolds when there are numerous victims showing up dead, drained of blood with two bite marks in their necks. This happens in London, in and around the time of Jack the Ripper. Although Jack;s name comes up on several occasions, it is clear to everyone that these murders are quite different. When the murders hit close to home on the British government, the Prime Minister authorizes a formation of a secret committee to find the killer and put an end to the panic. Members include a variety of individuals with different backgrounds, and of course some are Vampire believers and others are not. The most interesting of the group is Dr. Van Helsing himself. Plans are made, investigations are performed and as they say ' the chase is afoot'. <br />There are several endings to this story, both of which take up the last 100 pages of the book. The take on Van Helsing is one of the more interesting ones I've read and we are also finally introduced to more detail on the Illuminati. All in all, this is a good book ... not a great book, but better than some of his previous novels.
This is an extremely unique and captivating novel of a relationship of two gay men, one being a 2000 year old Vampire and the other an artist. The story is based in a monastery in Rome, where the two meet. Victor, the Vampire has taken recluse, under the guise of a monk and Paul, the artist from Kansas has been given an assignment of doing the illuminations of a manuscript of the gospels.<br />For those who are Catholic or devote followers of any religion will find this book very disturbing and may in fact not choose to finish the book. Not only is the gay sex very graphic and constant, but Victor's defiling of the monks and all things held reverent by religious people may be enough to turn your stomach. It's hard to believe that the author, Michael Schiefelbein, is said to have studied for the priesthood for 10 years. One gets the feeling that Mr. Schiefelbein had some very bad experiences during his studies and was either thrown out or left in such poor terms that nothing but spite and hatred are left.<br />The underlying story is actually a good one and if you can get beyond the gay sex and the religious perversity, it's very captivating. Due to developing situations, Victor transforms Paul into his Thrall, a being who is part human and part Vampire. There is a huge stake involved for both of their futures and the story intensifies as the stakes get higher.
This book follows Mina Harker both during the Dracula story and her life beyond where the original Dracula ends. Mina, if you remember is the newlywed bride of Jonathan Harker, the one who originally visited Count Dracula at his castle to arrange properties in and around London.<br />This is one of the most creative continuations of Dracula that you will ever find. You will once again meet all of the original characters and their struggle with Dracula as well as what their lives have become after they leave the castle when Dracula had turned to dust. Mina, still with the blood of Dracula in her, finds it hard, if not impossible to get on with a normal life. She has changed and this affect not only her but all of the people she has been the closest to. <br />This is a must read for all Dracula fans and a great thanks to Elaine Bergstrom for continuing the tradition.
This was a rather tedious book with little captivating appeal. It gives the account of Lord Byron, ala Interview with the Vampire, and his travels throughout various European countries, 'finding himself'. I thought the writing was disjointed as it didn't seem to flow well. The biggest question I found myself constantly asking was \\"Who cares?\\". Although Lord Byron is now celebrity status, I never felt drawn or attached to any of the characters to really cared what happened to them.<br />For those people who are fans of Lord Byron, I suspect you probably will like the book and find it entertaining. Maybe that was the whole point and I just missed it. However, for the rest of us, this was just a ho-hum kind of tale.
This is one of the finer novels of Saint-Germain that I've read to date. The immortal Count Saint-Germain washes ashore at the Saxon fortress of Leosan after a shipwreck in 937 A.D. He is rescued and nurtured back to health by Ranegonda, the Gerefa of the fort. Having a women run a fortress was unheard of at the time, however her brother, the original Gerefa, has joined the monks to follow the order of the White Christ and left Ranegonda in charge.<br />While the overall theme of the book is consistent with other Saint-Germain novels, in this story he does not have his own elaborate household with servants, his athanors, and his wealth. What he does have is a growing romance with Ranegonda as the months go by. From what I have read, she is one of the three great loves of his life. The fortress and surrounding village is at the outskirts of the Saxon empire, ruled by King Otto. They are few in number and struggle simply to survive from starvation, the plague, and the constant threat of outlaws living in the forests and the Danes. The people now also follow the teaching of the White Christ, as opposed to the 'old gods'.<br />For Saint-Germain fans, this is a must read book. It is very well written, moves quickly, and has one of the more satisfying endings than some of the others I've read.
This is a very imaginative, well written account of the Dracula story from Dracula's point of view. The main theme and events run very close to the original book, but describing the events as Dracula himself saw them; all the way from when Jonathan Harker first came to visit the Count, up to and including Dracula's apparent death.<br />It is essentially written is somewhat of a diary format and stays very consistent with the original novel. In other words, the pace, the accounts, and overall feel of the book are in line with Bram Stoker's novel. For Dracula fans, this is a must read, since it gives a different perspective of the legend. The Transylvanian Society of Dracula even went so far as to award this book as the Best Novel inspired by Dracula in the past century. You can't get higher praise than that.
Nightlife would be a great vampire / horror book if it didn't work so hard at trying to take a moral stance on the plight of the homeless and how various people from different backgrounds can all pull together for a common cause to defeat evil. This aspect of it was tolerable for a while, but when the book started focusing more on the social situation of the homeless and less on the Vampire, alot of the effect was lost, since the ending was become more predictable all of the time.<br />Richard Carnitch lives and feeds out of Minneapolis and is often portrayed as a Vampire of incredible strength, being able to get into peoples minds, summon and control thousands of animals of many species, and cast evil sensations in entire neighborhoods. In other ways, he's seen as very weak, submitting to childish cat and mouse games, and finding himself unable to deal with a situation with a few people with little if any influence or money can stalk and attempt to destroy him.<br />The book moves fairly quickly and has many interesting aspects to it but about two thirds of the way through, I couldn't wait for it to be over. Would I read a sequel? Probably.
This is a very unsatisfying, trite, and stereotype book. The 'Normals' or humans in the story are so poorly portrayed, that not even one of the is close to likable. The dialog is cheesy at best and even though you hope it's going to get better, it never does.<br />Okay, so you have another Vampire who's trying to undo what's been done to him a long time ago. He finds jobs as a doctor at clinics so he can continue his research with hope that one day he'll become human again. How many times are we going to have to go through this? You'd think by now authors could come up with an original idea once in a while.
Reflections of a Vampire is a very good, fast paced, quite entertaining, at times gruesome, well written book. It's quite a bit more than Vampire fiction, since it has many of the elements of fantasy built in; invisibility, blink of an eye shape-shifting, and fire beams, to mention a few. I disagree with other reviewers that this is a book in the tradition of Anne Rice. It is not. People use this comparison to the point of making it a clich√©, and basically having no meaning whatsoever. <br />As a story, this book has everything; Vampires, a Daemonion Council, shapeshifters, a priest, a book publisher and ghost writer, policemen, minions, very graphic gore, AIDS, castles, and a host of other things to draw from. The book could easily have been twice as long with the amount of ground the author covers. Damion Kirk does do a superb job at keeping the readers interest with a quick moving story, unpredictable events, and quite a bit of action.<br />The novel is dying for several sequels and I'm sure I'll read them if and when they are available. Unless you are a hard core Vampire reader, you may pass this book up since the cover price of the book is fairly high, especially for a first novel of an unknown author. It is done with quality paper and a very nice easy to read font, but still, I felt the price was out of line.
Some authors have a knack for telling a great horror story, and Joseph Curtin in Daughters of the Moon does exactly that. Curtin's writing style, well developed and interesting characters, smooth flowing storyline, grabs your attention and takes you on a pure horror ride. <br />The book revives Elisabeth Bathory, the infamous Blood Countess from 16th century Hungary and places her in the 1970's, eventually taking refuge in the outskirts of downtown Chicago. Lizabeth, as she is now known, takes on a prot√©g√© in Chloe Covington, the daughter of a wealthy Tobacco plantation owner from the south. Lizabeth leaves a trail of blood in her quest for money and power, playing on her victims fear, emotion, and guilt.<br />This book will stay with you for a long time due to the unique characters and personalities of just about everyone in the story as well as the gruesome settings and descriptions of Lizabeth's perversions. Mr. Curtin, take a bow for writing a captivating book and in being able to use all of the elements to keep the reader on edge and wanting more.
If you're looking for a good Vampire book, you'll find this one extremely lacking in just about every aspect. The bulk of this book is essentially an unbelievable account of a young woman's adventures in a world filled with drugs of every kind, graphic hardcore sex, brutal killings, and two Vampires. One of the two Vampires does nothing but eat real food, have sex as many times as day as he can, and is somewhat of an artist and has a bunch of groupies around him who treat him as a god. It's beyond me how reviewers can even think to mention this book in the same sentence to Anne Rice's novels. There is absolutely no comparison other than they are both available in a paperback.<br />This book reminds me of shock fiction; if you can't come up with something descent to write, then why not come up with as much sex, violence, drugs as possible. And why not throw in two Vampires, one of which is the quiet, hidden in the shadows, and tired of life kind of guy, and the other who acts as if he's got the energy of someone on steriods, has the testosterone of 10 men, and eats all the junk food he can get his hands on. <br />As far as Vampire books go, this is one to skip at all costs. Spend your time reading something that has some redeeming qualities, rather than something that relies on reaching down in the gutter.

Mondo Bizarro is one of the ways Elmo Land's is described at the end of the book. In fact, this entire book could be summed up in these two words. For most of the book I could only picture Elmo Land as a Forrest Gump type speaking in the voice of HAL from 2001, A Space Odyssey. <br />The book attempts to describe the world through Elmo Land's eyes in a post apoctoliptic time. Is he really a Vampire? Other than living for about 150 years, he could just as well have been a Hannibal Lecter, taking away all of the intelligence. Elmo's thought process is followed throughout the book as seen by the ongoing, disconnected thought pattern, as well as the continual repetition of text. This was entertaining for a while, but I could barely wait for the book to be finished. I got so bored with it after a while, the constant rambling, the repetition, the ignorance, and stupidity.<br />As a real Vampire novel, I'd say to skip this one. If you're into horror, then this will be a good one to pick up since, for what it is, it is well crafted and delivered in a unique and imaginative way.
While this book is about two Vampires who will do anything to destroy one another, the real story is about the humans who get caught in the middle and risk their own lives. The book moves along very quickly, almost too quickly in some places, it makes you wonder if it were written for a made for tv movie or for the big screen. Even though alot of time is spent trying to get into the hearts and minds of the main characters, it comes off as being too superficial and in many cases, stereotyping. This isn't necessarily a bad thing, it just gets annoying at times.<br />Mary Connely has been searching for her missing brother who she fears dead. In her search, she comes across Steve Ryan who seems to have been 'picked up' by the same woman Mary believes to be responsible for her brothers disappearance. Steve, who is divorced, is caught between the erotic and sensual woman he has just met and the warnings that Mary has given him. Mary's search for her brother and Steve's lust for the new woman in his life lead them to an ancient feud between two Vampires who will do absolutely anything to see each other destroyed.<br />The description of the Vampires and their surroundings is excellent. The author does an impressive job at describing the wretched, sickening, and repulsive way in which the Vampires exist. When the characters let you know they're ready to vomit at the sights and the smells, you know exactly why. If you like gory situations and a fast paced Vampire novel, then this book should satisfy you.
I was somewhat disappointed in this book. Much of it seemed rather corny and there's no doubt that it's superficial. It's a story of a girl, Mara, born in the year 362 who is raised by her father asto be a brutal warrior, just as he was. She knew nothing of being a lady and has a hard time adjusting to other people,especially to a young man, Gaar, who tries to win her affection. Her early life is little more than adjusting from being a mercenary to a woman of the times. As her life appears to be changing, she is transformed into a Vampire against her will and her life after that is never the same. The centuries drag by and her isolated and lonely existence cover much of the rest of the book. Working as a bar wench or a waitress for scraps of money barely enough to get by.....living off of rats and other small animals.. this is the life of someone who's immortal, can change into a wolf or bat whenever she chooses? Surely the author could have been more creative than that.<br />The ending of the novel seems very out of place, almost as if different person wrote it, or as if the author didn't know where to go with the book and simply came up with a way to end it. The book just didn't have a point, nothing to make you remember it by. I would put this very low on the list of Vampire novels.

The Last Vampire is an admirable sequel to The Hunger, published seven years earlier. The story follows Miriam Blaylock from Tailand to Paris and back to New York where she had intended to visit the once a century Conclaves where the Keepers convene. Mariam is considered quite a rebel in the eyes of other Keepers since she lives her life in the mainstream, flaunts money, technology, and is up to date with all of the latest marvels of modern time. During her visits, something goes seriously wrong and the old Keepers are being killed, removed from the face of the earth. Miriam, now also on the run for her life, return to the sanctity and protection of her New York home, and nightclub.<br />The book retains the style of it's predecessor, The Hunger, of seven years ago. The same colorful writing style, amusing descriptions, and suspense is consistent in both books. Surprising turn of events and an intriguing storyline continue to develop throughout. I read them back to back and could barely tell that there was such a span between the two books.<br />Based on the apparent outcome of the book, I would have liked to have more of a history of the Keepers and how they originated and developed throughout time. Perhaps Mr. Strieber will provide additional books at some later time. If you liked The Hunger, then you should read this sequel.
For a quick, lighthearted, and entertaining book, this first installment in the Cirque du Freak series should satisfy you. Most editorial reviewers suggest a 4th - 8th grade reading level however adults will find the book enchanting as well. The story is about 12 year old, Darren Shan's exploits and experiences with the Cirque du Freak and a Vampire, the famous Mr. Crepsley. Darren's fascination with spiders results in him stealing Madame Octa from the Cirque, who Mr. Crepsley pet spider. The situation get complicated for Darren after a series of events relating to his friend Steve, Madame Octa and the Vampire.<br />While the book is mildly entertaining, it was not enough for me to continue to read the second book, even though I purchased it and started it. Some reviewers have made comparisons to R.L. Stine and J.K. Rowling, mainly due to the age level and macabre content. Cirque du Freak certainly stands on it's own and will have it's own following and audience. Although entertaining, there is no real depth to the book, which, based on the reading level is not a surprise. The dialog between the characters is also kind of weak and some parts are a little slow moving, but all in all, it is a fun read and will not take you too long to finish.
The Hunger is a mesmerizing tale of a Vampire that has existed for thousands of years. Miriam Blaylock's thirst of the Hunger and the love of suitable companion is largely what drives her through the centuries. She offers her chosen mate immortality, and all of the powers that come with the transfusion of her blood. What her mates do not know is that they are not truly immortal, but will last only several centuries. After that they will age extremely fast and although they cannot die, they will suffer in a coma like state until the end of time; a horrible existence. Mariam is now preparing for a new companion; a doctor who has been doing research on the aging process. Things begin to get complicated and Mariam's life is in jeopardy.<br />This is a very well written book and captures both you attention and imagination. While Mariam is considered evil, it's hard not to cheer for her cause. The writing style is fast paced with alot of suspense and danger. As with many of the vampire novels available, this one also has it's own rules for Vampires with regard to their powers, strengths, and limitations. Vampire and horror readers should not pass this one up.
If you're looking for a great Vampire story with a twist, then Red Moon Rising is just the book for you. Instead of coming up with another variation of what the Vampires will be, Billie Sue Mosiman takes the predominant qualities and separates them into three distinct type of Vampires; the Predators, the Cravens, and the Naturals. Making this type of distinction no longer limits which qualities, powers, weakness', personalities, etc. the particular Vampires have to 'fit' in. <br />Della Cambian, a high school senior two weeks away from graduation, has finally caught the 'disease', the one which transforms one into a Vampire. Her mother, father, younger brother, and most of her blood relatives have already gone through the transformation. To help with the transition and to make sure Della make the right choice of which of the three types of Vampire she will be, the family's summons Mentor, the areas helper and guide.<br />Mentor has a variety of roles, which include keeping the peace in the Vampire community, making sure their secret is safe from mortals, and getting involved in disputes. One of the main crisis he has to deal with is when a doctor finds one of the local blood banks is shipping out untested blood, a situation that may have been going on for over a century. Unknown to her, the Blood Bank is run by a Predator Vampire who supplies the blood to the rest of the Vampires, for a fee. It is up to Mentor and Ross, the head of the Blood Bank, to ensure their secret isn't found out.<br />This book is very fast paced and has an engrossing storyline. It's well written, entertaining, and hard to put down once you get started.
Michael Romkey is an exceptional writer when it comes to descriptions, building a mood, and providing vivid graphic violence. Unfortunately, he does not seem to be able to tell a story. The plot behind the Vampire Hunter was truly disappointing and lacked focus. I don't mean to be overly critical; there is a storyline with a variety of characters, the building of a plot, and then everything sort of coming together at the end. However, it's lackluster, with predictable and stereo typed people with what comes down to a really silly ending. <br />The main gist of the story begins when the Vampire, Dante Gabriel Rosetti (Charles) is awoken and freed from being trapped in the Titanic when a movie crew makes an attempt to raise the ship from the bottom of the ocean. Being unconscious for about 80 years leaves this Vampire with no memory of who he is or any of his past. Through some aimless raveling he enters an asane asylum of his own free will and becomes a patient of psychiatrist Dr. Abigail (Abby) Bloome who makes it her personal mission to help him rediscover himself.The rest of the story is a variety of episodes of Charles fighting his own demons, good and evil in between a number of sessions with the good psychiatrist. Not only are the local police and FBI involved in recent brutal killings, but a Charles Bronson like character makes it his personal vendetta to find the Vampire who killed his wife on the ship that was part of the film crew trying to raise the Titanic.<br />As far as a Vampire story goes, it's a disappointing one. What it comes down to once again is, you have a Vampire who has a conscience; he knows what he is and he's going to try resist it. In this story he find a companion in a professional therapist who's going to help him get control over his inner demons - his Hunger.<br />Michael Romkey has tremendous potential as a writer. His wording, his descriptions, and the overall mood he creates makes reading the individual paragraphs a pleasure. I'll continue to purchase his books because sooner or later, he's going to write a fantastic novel.
Dead Until Dark is the first of the Southern Vampire series that introduces Sookie Stackhouse, a sexy cocktail waitress from Louisiana. Sookie is rather quiet, shy, and does her best to live with her disability; being able to read people's minds; i.e. a telepath. Early on in the book, a stranger, Bill, shows up and she is intrigued that she cannot read his mind, and for a good reason; Bill is a Vampire.<br />Vampires now have a certain status in many parts of the world and are free to live and come and go as they please. Japan has even developed a synthetic blood for them to drink and is stocked in many establishments, including the one where Sookie works. Bill and Sookie have a natural attraction to one another and a romance begins to emerge. At first glance this may sound somewhat corny but that is not the case at all. It is a highly imaginative story with a very nice blend of action, mystery, comedy, and romance. Sookie and Bill are both very likable, as are many of the other main characters in the novel. Charlaine Harris does a great job at developing their backgrounds and the result is a solid foundation on which to base future stories. This book is clever, imaginative, and by all means, fun.
This is one remarkable book delving in and around the times of Ivan IV of Russia in the late 1500's. Ferenc Rakoczy, (the Count Saint-Germain) is sent with an embassy of priests representing King King Istvan Bathory of Poland. Their mission is to ally the two countries for future attempts of invasion of the Turks. The Russian Czar is feared to have become mentally unstable after the death of his son and both the Russians and Poles fear the potential dangers this could create.<br />If you are familiar with Chelsea Quinn Yarbro's Saint Germain books, then you will once again marvel at the historical setting of this tale. One can't help but get absorbed into the life, the struggles, and sorrow of the times.<br />Ferenc Rakoczy, the close to 4,000 year old Vampire, blends in very well into the development of the story as he is not like Vampires that you'll find in other books. As he is described in this book: \\"All that death had given him was durability and strength far beyond that of the truly living, a degree of control over animals, superior night vision, and one specific thirst. The rest - the skills, the learning, the music, the compassion - he had acquired for himself in many long years and painful lessons\\".<br />This book does an excellent job at depicting the political and religious unrest of the times, the influence of the various European countries, the Orthodox and Roman Catholics, and the Turks. It's easy to get mesmerized with the story as it unfolds. Not only do you get an exceptional novel with a compassionate Vampire, but you are left with a history lesson you may never had the opportunity to discover.
This first in the Anita Blake Vampire Hunter series sets the stage, mood, and tempo of the rest of the novels. If you're tired of the slow paced, action free, whimpy vampires and werewolves that plague much of the novels in this genre, then Anita Blake is a dream come true for you. This book, as well as the other to follow offer a fast paced, high action, street smart punch that rarely lets up.<br />Anita Blake, a petite young woman is an animator; one who has the ability to raise the dead as zombies. Yes, this is her chosen profession, and not only is she one of the few in the country who has this ability, but she can more zombies per night than most, if not all of her peers. If that weren't enough, she is also a legal Vampire Slayer, meaning if she has the right papers from the courts, she can go out, hunt them down and kill them.<br />Anita is tough, very violent when she needs to be, street smart, resourceful, and can keep up with the insults of those around her that question her abilities and authority. She packs guns and knives and has access to just about any other assault weapon available. The book is full of great one liners, vicious Vampires, graphic violence and brutality, and sexual tensions. For Vampire lovers, this is a book you have to read.
Deep Waters brings a unique twist to the Buffy novels by introducing a Selkie and Merrows, both ancient sea creatures. A Selkie is a shape-shifting seal girl and Merrows are nasty creatures similar to mermaids. Willow, on one of her environmental rescue efforts, comes across a dainty oil clad creature and returns her to the library to learn what it is and how to get it back to the ocean. During their research, they discover she is a selkie and that her skin must be cleaned of oil before she can be returned to her natural habitat.<br />The Merrows, who also were affected by the oil spill, are downright nasty creatures and begin to kill people and wreak havoc on Sunnydale. It's up to Buffy and the gang to keep the town safe from the Merrows and at the same time restore the Selkie (given the name Ariel) to her natural environment.<br />The book is very funny at times due to some great dialog. There's also alot of Celtic history provided along with the good old fashioned bad guy slaying. Buffy fans will not want to pass this one up.
The first of the three book series, Covenant With the Vampire, is one of the best Vampire Sagas ever written. From the very start, a dark mood is set and it continues to unfold throughout the rest of the book. The story unfolds as Arkady Tsepesh's father has died and he and his pregnant wife are on route to Transylvania to undertake his late fathers role, that as an aid to a great uncle, Vlad Dracula. Arkady and his wife do their best to remain optimistic, but as the days go by, Vlad's evil begins to encompass every part of their lives.<br />The book is set as a prelude to Bram Stoker's Dracula and Jeanne Kalogridis does a magnificent job is setting the evil atmosphere you'd expect. The novel is filled with horror, suspense, tragedy, and despair, while always showing a ray of light and of hope that this evil can be overcome. This book is not to be passed up, whether you are a fan of Vampires or horror in general.
As a continuation of Covenant With the Vampire, in Children of the Vampire, Arkady Tsepesh lives in fear of the family obligation or curse to provide Vlad Dracula the first born male of each generation for a blood sacrifice. This has been a tradition for over 400 years and Arkady insists that this nightmare is going to end with him.<br />The book has the same dark atmosphere as the first in the trilogy and the suspense keeps building. Written in a diary format, you are able to get close to each person and feel their overwhelming hope, despair, tragedy throughout. This is an excellent sequel to Covenant With the Vampire.
'Witch' is the start of a wonderful new 'Wicked' series co authored by Nancy Holder featuring Holly Cathor, a senior in high-school who does not yet know that she is part of a very old line of very powerful witches. The story unfolds when Holly's parents are killed in a rafting accident and Holly is forced to move to Seattle to live with her aunt and two twin cousins. <br />Through a series of strange incidents and flashbacks we learn that Holly's ancient family has been part of a feud with another demonic line of witches, the Deveraux's, currently lead by Michael along with his two sons. If witches, warlocks, and the supernatural are for you, then you are sure to enjoy this first entry in this series.
This is a very unique, disturbing, and entertaining novel. It's the story of Jonathan both as a boy and a man and his dark fascination and perversion of flesh eating. For most of his early life, he would taste and eat his own flesh, but as he grows older he begins to have the desire to eat other people's flesh as well.<br />If you are squeamish and are easily offended, then this book is defiantly not for you. Many parts of the story are gory, gruesome, and downright morbid. However, if you keep the descriptive accounts in perspective, you'll find a very entertaining novel about a dark fetish and perversion towards cannibalism. The storyline stretches the limits of what is considered acceptable horror; almost a contradiction of terms. You may hate this book or love it but you will not be neutral to it. If horror and gore is what you're looking for, you're going to find it in this book.
Sips of Blood is a meandering story of vampires, blood worship, bondage, and sadism. I found it rather superficial and lacking substance. The characters, having no real believable personality, also added very little to the story. Even the infamous Marquis de Sade, of who this book revolves around is seen as little more than an everyday man with a secret life dealing with torture, pain, and brutality. Little if any of the psychological aspects of his mind and thought process are dealt with. <br />For those looking for an easy reading book dealing with porn, bondage, and a thirst for blood, then you probably will enjoy the book. However, if you expect something more substantial than superficial flash and shock, if you want to get into the minds, hearts, and souls of people and their behaviors, then you won't be satisfied.
The Palace, the second novel in the Saint-Germain series, provides a look at the religious and political hardships in Renaissance Italy.  The book focuses on the underlying struggles of the Pope in Rome and the renegade priest Savonarola, as well as the political up's and down's of the era. Our hero, the ever-elusive Francesco Ragoczy da San Germano, is caught in the middle of these conflicts to the point where he has to flee the city for his safety.<br />For those unfamiliar with the series, Saint-Germain is a Vampire, but not in the way we have come to know of them through other books and movies. He shares many of the same characteristics of the Vampires we know but to a lesser degree; without the flash, the magic, and evil we are accustomed to. He comes from a royal background, has a great scope of influence, is very wealthy, has a strong intellect, and due to his kind and caring nature, attracts the ladies of the time.<br />This novel is rather a sad one, since it focuses around the political and religious pain and torment people had to endure in order to survive. Italy, while in a glorious Renaissance, still was under the strong influence of the Church as well as local changing politics. Being called a Heretic, whether true or not, meant certain death, in a savage and cruel way. It is under these conditions that Francesco Ragoczy has chosen to live and this novel follows several lives within the government, the Church, the local builders, and artists.<br />If books with historical themes interest you, then you will certainly enjoy this book. If you're already a fan of Chelsea Quinn Yarbro, then you're sure to love the book.
The Ad on the cover of the paperback novel summarizes this book perfectly: \\"Think Hannibal Lecter by way of Anne Rice\\". Roderick Anscombe has created a fabulous horror novel with an enchanting style and storytelling of an Anne Rice. You are captured in the very first page of this 400+ page book and it is indeed hard to put this one down.<br />One word of caution for those looking for a true 'Vampire' novel.... you will not find it in this book. The Count Laszlo Dracula portrayed in this story is a 'real' live man, a real count, who has no special Vampiric powers. The struggle of the Hungarian Count is an obsession to savagely rip the throats of young women and lick the blood as it flows. His internal turmoil is his struggle and shapes what his life has become.<br />The psychological drama of the story is beautifully portrayed in every aspect of the Count's life; his internal struggle between good and evil, a doctor and yet a brutal killer, and a fiend behind the saint. Mr. Anscombe has indeed created a wonderful story of the internal strife of a man, with the style of an Anne Rice, Fyodor Dostoevsky, and the brutality of a Hannibal Lecter.
Michael Romkey has written a fast moving adventure novel combining the elements of Vampires, Black Magic, history, and modern science. The storyline flows very well and is presented consistant with the style of his previous books; concurrent events unfolding in successive chapters. With the exception of Ludwig, Romkey has introduced all new characters, and with his branching out into magic and disease science, entirely new avenues are waiting to be explored for future stories.<br />With the exception of the historial accounts, the entire plot unfolds in and around a rain forest of South America. Savage black magic and the uncovering of the Vampire Virus are the centerpieces of this drama. Romkey spends considerable time developing all of the characters and creates a mood of darkness, brutailty, tradition, and a hope for the future.<br />The book stands on it's own and can be read without reading the prior three novels. However, since Romkey turns in a new direction, you will not get the full breadth of his writing unless you read the prior three novels.
The third novel in Michael Romkey's Vampire series focuses on Nicoletta, the Vampire Princess. Her life story, from being a young girl to the ruthless Vampire she is today, brings up so many emotions, you find it hard to know if you should love her or despise her. Emotions ranging from sadness, sorrow and desperation, to savage, brutal, and totally barbarian.<br />The book bounces back and forth between a diary of Nicolette's past to a modern day outlandish terror adventure on the high seas. There are essentially two seperate story lines within this book with the Princess featured in both. The style of the book seemed rather 'choppy', with so many scenes, one after another. I believe this was intentional but I did find it irratating at times. <br />If you liked the previous two novels in this series; I, Vampire, and The Vampire Papers, then you have to read this one. David does have a role in the book, but it is minor and incidental. The story could have worked just as well without him, and in some ways, I wish that was so. When I think of him in this book, all I can say is: don't pity the fool.
Karen Taylor does a great job at storytelling in the Vampire Vivienne.  Although Vivienne is often portrayed as young and innocent and not very powerful for what we know of Vampires, it's hard not to like her and see her get what she wants. <br />The books takes place in two parts, the early 1700's in Paris and in modern times in the United States. It's an easy book to read and for the most part stays on the surface. The one criticism I'd have is that the ending is too abrupt. It's a good  and surprising ending, but it comes about to quickly and is over before you know it.<br />All in all, I enjoyed it very much and it keeps your interest up throughout.
Bloodlist is the first in a series of Jack Flemming, a reporter/writer turned Vampire in the midst of the post prohibition times of Chicago. Although Capone is in prision, mobsters still rule the streets, run the illegal gambling halls and have the cities polititions in their back pockets. Turf wars continue, revenge is a household word, and the various gangs are still as greedy for money and power as ever. They kill when they have to and know how to work the system. The one thing they've never come across is a real live Vampire.<br />Jack Flemming, only one day in Chicago has his life totally turned around and due to incidents in his past history turns into one of the undead. Jack's Vampire powers are somewhat different than those you will find in most of the other books featuring Vampires, and it is these very powers that make this book as entertaining as it is.<br />P.N. Elrod provides a nice blend of gangsters, mystery, violence, comedy, and the supernatural powers of a Vampire. The book moves along quickly and is action packed starting from the first paragraph. This is an easy series to get hooked on.
This book is indeed a fun read. P.N. Elrod continues the sagas of Jack Flemming, Vampire, and his adventures with the mobsters and corrupt polititions during post prohobition in Chicago.<br />This episode finds Jack caught between several local mob bosses, the boys from New York who are showing their muscle and of course the corrupt arm of the law. The book is very entertaining, funny, a mystery, has good old fashioned Chicagoland gangsters, and a Vampire who does his best to keep the peace.<br />Jack, as most Vampires nowadays has a conscience and will not feed from humans, but by living in Chicago close to the stockyards always provides him with all the nutrition he needs.<br />If you're looking for a fast paced, gangster mystery with a good hearted Vampire, then you're going to enjoy this book.
I, Vampire has all the elements to be a solid novel but at just about every turn fails to hit the mark. The storyline, the characters, the twists and turns, and even the historical aspects all have the feel of a low-budget B rated movie.<br />In a diary format, we learn about the facinating, yet barely believable life of David Parker. His path takes us from Chicago to Las Vegas to Paris and Germany. We get an interesting history of Russia from the Middle Ages to modern times. We're introduced to several famous historical characters, all of whom are Vampires that help David along the way.<br />It's almost like the author tried 'too hard' to make the story work, and in the process did an injustice to it. The choice of Mozart and the other historical characters takes away from the dark atmosphere and suspense and turns the book into an unintentional parody and in some cases a comedy, neither of which I believe was the attempt.<br />The book however, does stand on it's own and does lay the foundation for many sequels. I think the author has great potential to develop the character of David. I wouldn't put it at the top of the list of Vamp reads but definately take the time to read it when you can.
