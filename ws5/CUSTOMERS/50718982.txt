This is a beautifully written novel which reveals through the use of storytelling many occult mysteries. After reading this wonderful book, I was surprised to realize how many of my other books make reference to it. Overall, a delightful story with profound implications.
This book provides invaluable background information for any occult study. The author, and this book in particular, is widely known and referenced. I found the in-depth and complex analysis of the symbology of the fleur-de-lis particularly interesting and thorough.
Pythagoras is arguably the father of western culture. Certainly his theories have had a profound effect on the development of mathematics, music, architecture, the visual arts, philosophy, qabalah, astrology, astronomy, and the list goes on. Much as today's fans of Plato refer to Aristotle as a mere shadow of the former great man, so too can fans of Pythagoras say the same of Plato. Pythagoras was the first man to call himself a philosopher -- a lover of wisdom.<br />This book contains translations of all of Pythagoras' extant work, as well as many short essays by his contemporaries and students. There are many diagrams and charts which serve to effectively clarify his ideas. Overall, this book is a must have for any who seek truth.
This book is mistitled. It should be called &quot;Gypsy-Flavored Wicca&quot;. Wicca, of course, never existed before Gardner. While Wicca incorporates some older practices, it is not identical with them. If you call this Gypsy Magic, you may as well say that Catholicism is the same as Paganism, and that Tibetan Buddhism is the same as Hinduism.
I recommend that any fan of William Blake buy this volume and the other 5 in the series. The books are beautiful, large, and handsomely bound. Each book is reproduced in full color, using a six-color printing process rather than the standard four. The pages are heavy, opaque and have a gorgous lustre indicating very high quality paper. The text of each book accompanies the color reproductions in standard typeface with very competent commentary to boot.

The bulk of this book consists of Liber 963 itself (Treasurehouse of Images). This is one of the most beautifully stunning pieces of verse I have ever read, at once compelling, imaginative and detailed. This work is not published in many other places, and the books it is published in typically are out of print and demand high price tags. Therefore it is well worth the price of this book just to be able to have hard copy (in paperback, portable form no less) of 963. However, the description did lead me to believe that the other authors listed contributed significantly to this particular publication, which is not the case. There is additional material, but not very much and the additions consist of information easily found elsewhere. I would still buy this book over again, but it would have been nice to know the real value of the other contributed work.
If you are looking for a book to reinforce your beliefs about Crowley as a  Beast or as a Saint, don't read this book. This is the first apparently  unbiased biography of Crowley. Yet the author has done extensive and  exhaustive research, examining Crowley as a man who had an enormous impact  on modern culture, like it or not. It shows the heroic and superhuman side  of Crowley as well as the depraved and self-hating side, even-handedly,  without exaggeration or sensationalism. The book is beautifully written in  general.<br />This is a mainstream biography, and I feel it will open the gate  to further discovery and analysis by mainstream culture. It is remarkable  that such a man as Crowley until now had no biography which was ever filed  in the biography section.
This translation is incomplete and contested by modern latin authorities.  Their protests, however, are minor compared to the requisite nature of this  text. It provides countless perspectives on the nature of the Kabbalah, and  presents it in clear (if dry) language.
This book is critical for those pursuing hermetic spirituality. It is very  difficult to read though, especially for we young americans who have such  short attention spans. The language is complex, monotonous (as much as  printed text can be) and in many places boring. Nonetheless, it is a great  reference for telesmatic imagery and as a reference.
Princeton University Press has thoroughly impressed me with this series. Using higher quality paper than I've ever seen in publishing, along with an unheard-of *six* color printing process, they have reproduced the colors  like never before. In addition to the color plates, a full reprint of the  text is included in typescript, as well as informed and thoughtful  commentary. Well done! Too bad the hardback is out of print (or was at the  time of this review).
Although the cover makes promises that the book doesn't deliver on, and despite the cover's cheesy graphic, this book is great for anyone starting out in Magick. Even if you're not spiring to be a sex magickian, the  information is useful and Kraig points out that even the non-sexual  practicioner would benefit greatly just from the experience of  experimenting with it. Be forewarned that some of the historical data Kraig  suggests is questionable, and there are some assertions made about the OTO  which I am uncertain about the accuracy of. But it is definitely refreshing  to see an author writing so extensively about sex magick who is somewhat  familiar with systems such as the Golden Dawn and OTO. He also is very  clear about the differences between Tantra and Sex Magick, which puts Kraig  miles ahead of many current writers on the subject. To boot, there's a  chapter on BDSM Sex Magick! Woohoo!

I would recommend buying every book published by Aleister Crowley. First, you need them all to understand any of them. Second, most of them become more valuable over time. This work is one that I might consider an  exception because it seems to be a condensed pamphlet of the divination  material covered in the Book of Thoth. However, it does boast a lovely  cover page and its portability is handy. Get it for those two reasons, and  the fact that it might go out of print and become valuable.
This book is great. I would recommend it to anyone interested in healthcare. Fantastic pictures and drawings and well-planned overall.
Despite the criticism by others here about the re-hashing of old material, it is a common practice in the publishing industry to improve popular publications over time. I have found this edition of a timeless work to be  particularly useful for its color plates and the five different indexes  have proven invaluable on countless occasions.
