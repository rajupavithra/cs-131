Archbishop DMITRI (Royster) of the Orthodox Church in America has done a great service to the Church with his commentary on Christ's miracles as they are recorded in the four canonical Gospels.  Although the book is short, I believe it would be of great use to any Orthodox Christian (or any Christian for that matter).  <br />Not by any means a work of critical scholarship, this commentary is written in a style which is easy for the average layman to understand.  Avoiding modern Bultmannian assumptions, Archbishop DMITRI focuses on the traditional patristic interpretation of Christ's miracles, while at the same time making these interpretations applicable to the average Orthodox Christian reader today.  <br />He also devotes special attention to the lectionary of the Orthodox Church.  In fact, the miracles are commented on in the order in which they fall in the Church's yearly lectionary, rather than the order in which they are recorded in the Gospels.  He discusses the importance of the days which have been appointed by the Church for the reading of each of the miracle stories in the Church year.<br />I found Archbishop DMITRI's commentary very helpful, and I would recommend it to anyone searching for an introductory commentary on Christ's miracles written from an Orthodox Christian point of view.
Professor Veselin Kesich gives a balanced, scholarly look at how modern biblical criticism has helped to give a clear picture of Jesus and the early Church.  He contends that &quot;the proper function of criticism is  not to destroy the tradition of the Church, but to illumine it; it is not  to reject old insights, but to open new avenues of understanding of God's  ways and purposes in history.&quot; (p. 47)  <br />In attempting to illumine  the Church's tradition, Kesich looks at the historical evidence for Jesus,  the various forms of modern criticism, the writing of the canonical  Gospels, the image of Christ presented by the four Gospels (&quot;Four  Perspectives, One Image&quot;), the process of compiling the New Testament  canon, Jesus' message, and the historical setting of the Gospel.  <br />I  found particularly interesting his chapter on &quot;The Drive to  Objectivity&quot;.  He points out that the presuppositions of a critic or  theologian usually &quot;influences his study of the Gospels more than  anything else.&quot; (p. 39)  Presuppositions about the dates, authorship,  etc. of the Gospels and Epistles (none of which have been accurately  established by historians) can drastically influence the conclusions that  critics come to in their study of the Bible.<br />The only problem I have with  the book is that Kesich repeatedly states that the modern approach to  biblical study is the best available today, pointing out that there are  problems with much of the exegesis of the Church Fathers.  Certainly, the  Church Fathers were not perfect, but as an Eastern Orthodox Christian  (Kesich is also Orthodox, Professor of New Testament at St. Vladimir's  Orthodox Theological Seminary), I would say that it is still much more  helpful to read the Church Fathers than modern critics.  For instance, I  find the interpretation of St. John Chrysostom of the Parables of Jesus  much more useful than some modern critic's theories about the supposed date  that John's Gospel was written.  I do, however, believe that modern  criticism can be very useful in putting the Gospels in context.  I think  Kesich does a great job of evaluating the recent historical and  archaeological findings in light of the Tradition of the Church--findings  which are often used to destroy the Church's Tradition.
In this 40-page booklet, Fr. Gregory Rogers, a PhD. candidate at the University of Chicago in the History of Christianity, examines the subject of Apostolic succession from the view of the Historic Orthodox Church.   Apostolic succession, so important to the first-century Church, is often  misunderstood and even tossed aside by many of today's churches and  theologians.<br />Fr. Gregory begins with the Biblical foundation of Apostolic  succession, examining the authority Christ gave His Apostles in Matthew  16:13-19.  He looks at how this authority is carried out at the Council of  Jerusalem and throughout the Book of Acts and the Epistles.  He points out  the catholicity and oneness of the Apostolic Church of the New Testament  and refutes modern claims that Paul acted independently of the Apostles.   <br />He goes on to describe the passing on of this Apostolic authority  through the laying on of hands to disciples, such as St. James, the Brother  of the Lord, who was the first bishop of Jerusalem.  The second chapter  focuses on the writings of the Apostolic Fathers:  the Apostles'  successors.  He shows that the early Church was a eucharistic community  under the authority of bishops.  Apostolic succession was the means by  which bishops, priests, and deacons, and even baptised lay people could  prove that they were part of the same eucharistic body as the Apostles.   This is evident in the writings of St. Clement of Rome, St. Ignatius of  Antioch, etc.  <br />He goes on to describe the difference in the view of the  Eastern Orthodox Church on Apostolic succession, which mirror those of the  early Church, and the view of the Western churches, which mirror the views  of St. Augustine.  St. Augustine's view was that anyone who could trace his  succession back to the Apostles, regardless of whether or not he was in  communion with the rest of the Church, had valid Apostolic succession.   Such was not the view of the early Church, and is still not the view of the  Orthodox Church today.<br />This is not simply a scholarly book about  Apostolic succession.  Rather, it is the &quot;personal testimony of a  Bible-believing evangelical Protestant who examined the data and emerged an  Orthodox believer.&quot; [taken from back cover]  I highly recommend this  book about this often misunderstood subject.
This book offers an excellent look at the experience and vision of the Holy Trinity in the life of the Orthodox Church.  Rather than attempting to explain that which words cannot explain, the author instead chooses to illustrate how the Triune God has manifested Himself to mankind throughout  history.  The book is divided into four parts: The first section,  &quot;Biblical Theology,&quot; deals first with how the Trinity was  revealed mysteriously to the Patriarchs and Prophets of the Old Testament.  It then moves on to the more clear manifestations of the Trinity in the New  Testament, both in the Gospels and in the early Apostolic communities. The  second section, &quot;Liturgical and Sacramental Theology,&quot;  illustrates how the Holy Trinity is manifested and experienced in the  liturgical and sacramental life of the Orthodox Church. In the third  section, entitled &quot;Trinitarian Theology in the Fathers and in the  Councils,&quot; the author examines how the Trinitarian Theology of the  Church developed in the writings of the Church Fathers and Church Councils  which refuted such teachings as Arianism and other heresies.  Bobrinskoy  does an excellent job of illustrating the continuity as well as the  diversity of the theologies of the Church Fathers throughout the ages.  The final section, &quot;Doctrinal Synthesis,&quot; looks at the continuity  of the biblical manifestations of the Trinity, the experience of the  Trinity in the liturgical life of the Church, and the Trinitarian theology  of the Church Fathers.  It then turns to how each of these manifestations  of the Trinity come together to form the doctrine of the Orthodox Church.  I highly recommend this book.  Although difficult to follow at times,  Bobrinskoy gives the reader an indepth look at the manifestation of the  Trinity to mankind throughout history.
This is the story of Okonkwo, a young man living in the land of Umuofia in Africa.  He is a strong warrior whose life is dominated by fear and anger.  As the story develops, the author gives a clear picture of the everyday  life of Okonkwo's tribe, the Ibo.  The author deals explicitly with the  family life and the religion of the Ibo people.  Many of the aspects of  this primitive life seem savage and uncivilized to many readers, such as  the ritual killing of children and polygamy.  About half-way through the  book, the local tribes come into contact with British missionaries who  settle around them in the hopes of spreading the Christian Faith.   This is  the point where things begin to fall apart for Okonkwo and his fellow  tribesmen as the European missionaries for the most part wish not only to  &quot;Christianize&quot; the tribes of Umuofia, but to completely wipe out  their African heritage and customs, and to turn the land into a sort of  British colony.  Sadly, this method of completely wiping out one's culture  and replacing it with the culture of one's homeland has been used by many  of the mission efforts of Western Christendom throughout the centuries.   The author is very descriptive about the tragic effects this form of  mission work can have on a culture. Christian missionaries may find this  book offensive.  However, I believe that it should be read by anyone  considering Christian missionary work.  The cultural insensitivity  exhibited by the missionaries in this book is a pitfall into which all  missionaries are in danger of falling in their attempts at spreading the  Gospel.  For a more Orthodox approach to mission work, I recommend MONKS,  MISSIONARIES, &amp; MARTYRS:  MAKING DISCIPLES OF ALL NATIONS by Fr. Luke  Alexander Veronis (Light &amp; Life Publishing).
This book can be used as a great index to the ante-Nicean Fathers 10-volume set, or simply as a reference book for early Christian beliefs through the 4th Century.  This is an easy source to find out what the early  Church Fathers (some of them disciples of the Apostles) taught about such  things as salvation, the Apocrypha, Heaven, Hell, worship, sin, the  Priesthood, the Church, etc.  I recommend this book as a great place to  find the teachings which were &quot;once and for all delivered to the  saints&quot; (Jude 3) and accepted universally by the One, Holy, Catholic,  and Apostolic Church. The beliefs of the Church Fathers quoted in this book  are backed by Scripture and still held by the Orthodox Church to this day.
Stamoolis is probably the first author to deal exclusively with the Eastern Orthodox Church's beliefs regarding mission and evangelism.  Tracing her roots all the way back to the day of Pentecost, the Holy  Orthodox Church has historically been a missionary Church, fulfilling the  Great Commission given by our Lord to &quot;make disciples of all  nations.&quot; (Matt. 28:19)  Her missionary endeavors can be seen in the  pages of the Book of Acts, as well as throughout history in the untiring  efforts of such holy evangelists as St. Innocent, missionary to North  America, and Sts. Cyril and Methodius, both missionaries to the Slavs.   However, the Orthodox Church has not always been able to fulfill the Great  Commission because of the persecution she has faced.  In the 20th century,  Orthodox Christians have endured widespread persecution at the hands of  Communism (in Russia and Romania) and Islam (in the Middle East, Africa,  and parts of Asia).  Therefore, many Orthodox immigrants to America have  lost their missionary zeal and see as their primary goal to preserve their  heritage, but lack the desire to share their faith with others.   The goal  of the author is to shatter the myth that the Orthodox Church is not  evangelistic, and to explain how the theological differences between  Eastern Orthodoxy and Western Christianity determine how they view  missiology differently.  He does a wonderful job of explaining Orthodox  mission theology as well as giving a good historical background of Orthodox  missionary work to show how this theology has developed.  He also talks  about the current missionary work being done by the Orthodox in Africa as  well as the &quot;Diaspora&quot; in America. The only downside to this book  is that it is not current.  Written in 1986, much has changed since this  book was written regarding the Eastern Orthodox Church's involvement in  mission and evangelism.  Following the reception of the Evangelical  Orthodox Church into the canonicalOrthodox Church in 1987, the Church has  enjoyed much growth in America.  Also, the Church has enjoyed much growth  all over the world largely through the efforts of the Orthodox Christian  Mission Center and the Society of St. Nicholas of Japan.  It would be great  if a new edition to this book was published, or if a more current book on  this subject was written.
Fr. Jon Braun's book is best explained by its subtitle, &quot;The Orthodox Path to Christian Victory&quot;.  Rather than simply asking Jesus into our hearts and expecting a prosperous life simply because we are Christian, the  author urges us to fight the good fight (cf. 2 Tim. 4:7) and to wage  all-out war with sin.  In the preface of the book, he writes:  <br />&quot;It  has been my experience that there are millions of committed Christians in  Protestant Churches who sincerely love God with all their hearts but who  also have discovered that the Christian life is often...a battle against  sin.  They...are frustrated because they aren't winning what they believe  should be their share of those spiritual wars.  It is my conviction that in  the depth of Orthodox theology and spirituality, new--actually,  old--answers may be found.&quot; (page xi)<br />Beginning with an assessment  of the battle all Christians have been called to fight, Fr. Jon then turns  to basic Orthodox theology regarding the Trinity, the Incarnation, etc. as  the foundation for our struggle in this battle.  Finally, he explains the  tools, or weapons, we may use to fight the good fight such as prayer,  fasting, almsgiving, and living a virtuous life.  These tools have been  used in and encouraged by the Church for 2000 years.  They are  &quot;time-tested&quot;.  Fr. Jon writes:  &quot;We don't have to  experiment.  The Church now has two thousand years of battle knowledge  behind her.  We can trust what she's learned...&quot; (p. 146)<br />I highly  recommend this book as a good, solid introduction to basic Orthodox  spirituality.  It is well-written in a common language which anyone can  understand.  After one has read this book, I would also recommend ORTHODOX  SPIRITUALITY: A BRIEF INTRODUCTION by Bishop of Nafpaktos Hierotheos  (published by Birth of the Theotokos Monastery).<br />The below review of this  book is very misleading. DIVINE ENERGIES has nothing to do with cruelty to  animals.
This great book, written for evangelicals, encourages Christians to do more than proclaim Jesus as their Savior and evangelize.  He emphasizes that the Lord calls each of us to live holy lives.  According to St. Paul,  all Christians are to run with endurance the race that is set before us.  (Hebrews 12:1)  Gillquist says that Christians should put less emphasis on  starting this race, and much more emphasis on finishing the race, living  holy lives which imitate Christ's life on earth.  We are to look to the  cloud of witnesses, the Saints of the Church who have already completed the  race, for inspiration and intercession.  As St. Ignatius of Antioch says,  we should not merely &quot;be called Christians&quot;, but rather by our  works &quot;be found to be Christians.&quot;  Instead of having a  &quot;once saved, always saved&quot; attitude, we are to work out our own  salvation with fear and trembling. (Philippians 2:12) I found this book to  be very inspirational in our struggle for salvation.  However, it is  incomplete. This book was written when Peter Gillquist was on a journey,  along with 2000 other believers, searching for the New Testament Church.   They have found that the very Church which is spoken of in the Book of Acts  and the letters of the Bible is still alive today in the Holy Orthodox  Church, which traces its very beginning back to the Day of Pentecost.   Peter Gillquist (now Fr. Peter, and Eastern Orthodox priest), has come to  the realization, along with so many others, that the ideal place to live  holy lives and to work out our salvation in fear and trembling is in  Christ's Church, against which the gates of hell shall not prevail.   (Matthew 16:18)   I would recommend, in addition to reading this book,  reading BECOMING ORTHODOX, also by Gillquist, to find out what Gillquist  discovered about the importance of Christians living holy lives IN THE  CHURCH which Christ and His Apostles founded.  BECOMING ORTHODOX is also  available from Amazon.com, although I'm not sure of the price.

This book is a well-researched study of the Holy Angels from both the Eastern and Western Christian perspectives.  Mother Alexandra's study begins with angels as presented in the Pentateuch and looks at them  throughout the Prophets, the New Testament, and Church history.  It also  looks at how angels have been imaged throughout the ages in Orthodox  iconography as well as Western Christian art.  This study was prompted when  Mother Alexandra was a young girl and actually saw her Guardian Angel.   Before Mother Alexandra died, I was blessed to hear her speak about this  experience. She writes about this experience in her book.  &quot;I'm as  sure of it now as I was then,&quot; she says.  I would recommend this book  for anyone interested in learning more about angels and their purpose both  in Heaven and on earth.
This holy man, St. John Maximovitch of San Francisco and Shanghai, has given us a wonderful explanation of the veneration of the Blessed Virgin Mary in the historic Orthodox Church.  He explains that to not honor the  Mother of God is to not honor the Lord Jesus Christ, giving examples in  history of anti-Christian sects who have attempted to sway people from  Jesus Christ by dishonoring His Mother.  He also explains that certain  doctrines added to the Christian faith by the Roman Catholic Church, such  as the doctrine of the Immaculate Conception, though intended to give honor  to Mary, actually dishonor her.  Finally, he gives a thorough explanation  of the place of the Holy Virgin in Christ's Church and why it is important  to give honor to the &quot;highly favored one&quot; (Luke 1:28).  May the  most holy Mother of God save us by her prayers!
This book delivers a compelling message to African-Americans.  In an age when black Americans are turning to Islam by large numbers, this book offers a powerful alternative to Protestant Christianity and Islam in  historic, Orthodox Christianity:  the Faith of the Apostles.  It shatters  the myth that Islam is the proper and historic of black peoples by showing  the historic Christianity that has been alive in Africa since the time of  the Apostles.  There are also wonderful depictions of the religious lives  of the American slaves and testimonies of African-Americans who have  discovered the ancient Church.  The only downside is that the book  downplays the importance of the broken communion between the &quot;Oriental  Orthodox&quot; and &quot;Eastern Orthodox&quot; Churches, as well as  between canonical and non-canonical churches.  These are schisms which need  to be healed, but the lines should not be blurred.  Still, I highly  recommend it.
This book has some serious strong points.  Dodds does a good job of pointing out problems with some of Louis Farrakhan's most famous speeches.  She holds nothing back as she shows inconsistencies and hypocrisy in  Farrakhan's speeches.  She unveils his core goals of converting blacks to  the militant Nation of Islam rather than to promote peace as he says.  I  would definitely recommend someone who is considering joining the NOI to  read this book first. Dodds is definitely well-read in the scriptures.   However, I was a little turned off at some inconsistencies at the beggining  of the book.  In talking about the Bible, she mentions the Apocrypha as an  &quot;unauthorized biography&quot; of the Bible.  What a huge mistake!  The  so-called apocryphal books have been in the Septuagint, which was used by  Christ and His Apostles, since 180 B.C.  She also makes the statement that  &quot;Orthodox Christians believe that these documents should not be  included in the Bible.&quot;  Another huge mistake!  The Orthodox Church,  which is the Church founded by Christ and His Apostles, has ALWAYS included  the Apocryphal books in the Old Testament canon since the Orthodox Church  has not changed its Old Testament canon since the time of Christ!  It was  not until about 500 years ago that Christian Old Testaments began to appear  without these books.   Also, in discussing what Christians believe, there  is no mention of the Orthodox Church, the Church which was founded at  Pentecost in the Bible, and which has flourished in North Africa since the  first century.  It would benefit African-Americans to know this, especially  since so much emphasis is put on the Church in the Bible.   But otherwise,  it is a wonderful book which offers African-Americans considering Islam a  powerful alternative in the truths of Christianity.
Many Orthodox scholars such as Fr. Jack Sparks, Bishop KALLISTOS Ware, &amp; Fr. Constantine Nasr.  It was overviewed by such Orthodox authorities as Fr. Thomas Hopko, Fr. Stanley Harakas, and bishops representing  virtually every Orthodox diocese in North America.  I find this Study Bible  very useful in introducing people to Orthodoxy through the Holy Scriptures  as well as a wonderful companion for every Orthodox Christian.  I believe  that any Orthodox family could benefit from having this Study Bible in  their home.<br />There are wonderful notes on nearly all the verses of the New  Testament, giving the interpretation of the Orthodox Church on the Holy  Scriptures.  It also includes a lectionary, chapters on &quot;How to Read  the Bible,&quot; and &quot;Introducing the Orthodox Church,&quot; and  wonderful articles are interspersed throughout the Bible on such topics as  &quot;Confession,&quot; &quot;The Four 'Orders' in Church Government,&quot;  and &quot;The Transfiguration.&quot;  The pages are also graced by the  presence of beautiful icons.<br />I do have a few minor problems with this  Bible.  Some is left to be desired in the Book of Psalms, largely because  the Septuagint, the Old Testament of the Orthodox Church, was not used.   (Of course, this is about to be resolved because the same group of people  is currently working on the Old Testament Orthodox Study Bible using the  entire Septuagint text.)  It was also disappointing to see that in the  Morning and Evening prayers in the back, there is no mention of the Virgin  Mary. However, the notes and articles throughout the Study Bible clearly  explain the emphasis which is put on the Virgin Mary in the Orthodox  Church.<br />I would highly recommend owning this Study Bible, and I don't  feel that it deserves a lot of the harsh criticism it has gotten.  They did  an excellent job!
A wonderful book!  Rice and Perkins hold nothing back as they show that the race problems in America cannot be worked out simply by passing laws.  The only way true healing can take place between hostile races is through  Christ's unconditional love for all of us.  They strongly encourage  churches to open their doors and arms to people of different races and  cultures and to work out their differences through God's Grace rather than  simply passing legislation. This book offers strong, proven examples of  black and white Christians learning to live and worship together in  Jackson, MS.  Highly recommended!
I generally enjoyed this book.  Although difficult to follow at times, Fr. Seraphim Rose does a good job of showing that Nihilism is in fact the root of modern revolutionary thought.  He offers excellent Orthodox Christian  responses to those who say, &quot;There is no truth.&quot;
This pamphlet is a powerful search through history for the New Testament Church.  Anyone wishing to find the Church in the Book of Acts and worship as St. Paul and St. Peter did should read this pamphlet.
This wonderful treasure of Russian spirituality chronicles the life of a holy man, a priest living in Communist Russia as told through the people who knew him best:  his friends and spiritual children.  Through all the  trials and oppression Father Arseny faces under the Communist government,  he perseveres like a true Christian warrior.  Readers should find his life  an encouragement in pursuing their spiritual lives and not despairing when  confronted with various trials.
This book tells the incredible story of roughly 2,000 former evangelical Protestants who find the New Testament faith in the historic Orthodox Church.  I was a part of this group of 2,000 believers, and this is a  wonderful account of our story, as well as some of the questions we had  regarding Orthodoxy which many Protestant Christians ask.  Highly  Recommended!
Lewis' Great Divorce is a wonderful, entertaining story which gives a classic, orthodox Christian perspective on Heaven, Hell, and the life to come. A must-read for every Lewis fan.
This is one of the best books I have ever read.  Hardenbrook deals like no other author with the feminized male in American society.  He offers good, solid solutions to the crisis among American males in historic Orthodox  Christianity.  A must-read for every Christian man.
