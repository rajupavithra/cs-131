This reference guide is a life saver! I keep it on hand to help me through new tasks, and use it as a quick guide for time saving keystrokes and shortcuts. I have purchased all the Microsoft Office guides and think they  are fantastic! I would recommend them to anyone - for new users the step by  step instructions are easy to follow, so they will have you up and running  in no time. If you are familiar with the software they are a great  reference for less used tasks. Thumbs up!
