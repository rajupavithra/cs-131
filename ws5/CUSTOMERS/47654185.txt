This book is great for the family who wants to do it all!  We saved time and money.  I buy an updated copy every so many years but honestly it probably isn't necessary.  The book changes very little from year to year.  The book details out a &quot;perfect&quot; day (what to see at the parks and most importantly when to see it!) and even comes with a removeable daily recommended schedule to follow.  If you prefer a carefree stroll at the park this book is not for you.  The reader who will benefit is the one who is passionate about getting there early in the day and sometimes sprinting from ride to ride.  There are money saving ideas too - but mostly no brainers.  If you fit the bill...GET THE BOOK!
