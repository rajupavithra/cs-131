I've just finished this book. I was surprised to find in it much more from what I expected.

Highgrove should be a model for others to follow. Excellent work Prince & team!
There is a great need for such books on Byzantine Art. These three expo. and books by the Met on Byzantium are magnificent! I wish others will follow on Post-Byzantine Art.

Prince Charles is all about high quality, in everything he does. In time he will be followed by others!
This book is about an honest account of a royal layman about the visual quality of his country. I'm an architect and I appreciate what he is trying to say even if I don't agree with all the points he is making. Architects today are too much restricted to their out \\"sub-culture\\", we need  a more \\"holistic\\" approach to what we do. I wish this \\"vision\\" would have been more \\"ambitious\\" and \\"deep\\" because it deserves to be so! In time the most of the points of this \\"vision\\" will prove right, I'm sure!
