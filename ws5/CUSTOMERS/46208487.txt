Stephen Davis' \\"Jim Morrison: Life, Death, Legend\\" is a very interesting depiction of arguable one of the most interesting rockers ever.  I have not been a fan of The Doors for a long time, but I have long enough to know the myths and rumors about Jim and Jim's life.  ALong with many other topics, they are all covered in this book in a seemingly accurate style.   <br />  The part of Jim's life I was most interested in reading about when I picked up this book was his childhood and adolesence.  Davis covers the life of Jimmy, and he was called when he was young, as thorough as any other time of Jim's life.   <br />  The overall mood of the book I guess could depend on your feelings about Jim Morrison and The Doors before starting, but being a moderate fan, I find it funny at times due to Jim's constant intellectual rampages and his constant intoxication, while simultaneously finding it frustrating and almsot sad seeing Jim do the things he did to himself.  Davis does a good job flowing at a very comfortable rate and pace so the reader seems to just flow from one thing to the next, and usually going into great detail, even too much detail at time, about minor events along the way to the end, Jim's death.  Davis does a remarkable job staying neutral, at least to my inexperienced observations, throughout the entire book, and pretty much leaves it up to the reader to make up their mind about Jim. <br />  For a biogrpahy about a rock star, 400 pages seems a bit long, but they go by fast.  If anybody has a remote interest in the band or Jim Morrison, this book is probably one of the better of it's sort, and would come highly recomended from me.  \\"Jim Morrsion: Life Death, Legend\\" is both a good introduction to Jim Morrison for newer fans like me, and with the amount of detail about tours and recording sessions, probably for the lifelong Doors fans as well.  Considering everything, Stephen Davis' \\"Jim Morrison; Life, Death, Legend\\" is a very good book.
Europe for Dummies is a perfect book for a first or second time traveler to Europe.  In March I went on a trip to four countries in Europe and took three different travel guides with me.  Europe for Dummies was used much more than the other two that I had brought, and with justified reasons.  A previous reviewer said it was too vague, and although I agree with them in some aspects, Europe for Dummies saved us more time and even money in some cases than I ever expected any of the books to.  The descriptions are short and full of information, which is what I want when I am traveling.  Detailed maps and directions also hellp make Europe for Dummies a great travel guide.  Whether or not you would be buying this book to take with you, or to read it before you go on a trip to Europe, Europe for Dummies is a great source of information to prepare and inform you for the many awesome and surreal sights Europe has to offer.  Definitely recomended.
The Best 357 Colleges is, more than anything else, a fun book to look through.  I am a first year student at Arizona State University and have intentions to transfer after my sophmore year to a New England school.  I picked this book up to see what kind of information was given about some of the colleges I am looking into.  The book does a better than expected job of giving the reader a sense of what the school may be like, but it gives positive only reviews to the overwhelming majority of the schools in there.  They are the \\"best\\" 357 schools, but with the exception of the Application Process, all of the schools could seemingly be described with the same generic explanations. <br />   Away from the lack of realistic and necessary criticism, I still enjoyed the book.  SO full of information about so many school, and a very easy and even fun book to follow.  All of the school's contact information is in there, along with all of their application requirements and deadlines.  Costs, demographics, most popular majors, and even information about the amount of people that smoke, drink, study, participate in sports is made very visible in The Best 357 Colleges.  The Best 357 Colleges is  great guide to basic facts and information about colleges and would definitely be a great guide to prospective college students trying to gather as much information as they can before the approaching application deadlines. <br />
I am not a person who has been living a long time.  I am 17, but Tuesdays with Maurie made me think of life in a whole different way.  I read Tuesdays with Maurie on and off for over a year.  The book is excellent, I just have been very busy with work and school.  While reading Tuesdays with Maurie, I felt guilty sometimes of feeling bad for myself when I had a bad day.  Maurie is somebody that anybody, and everybody, could look up to.  No matter how bad his problem was, ALS was his, he would always insist to hearing Mitch's first.  Maurie was an individual that anybody could have one up to and would immediately feel better.  Although I never actually met Maurie, I feel like i knew him as well as anybody.  Maurie is truly one of teh most genuine kind-hearted people I have ever known.  Through other people's love for him, something he will always be remembered by, Maurie has made a positive impact on people like me everywhere.  I not only recomend this book, I STRONGLY advise you to read this book.  I have never said there is a book everybody should read, but Tuesdays with Maurie might just be the book that changes that.

Killing Pablo is a book that should have been made into a movie.  It had every aspect of a good movie needed to succeed.  Pablo Escobar, who was at the time, the single most powerful drug trafficker in the world.  As he became more powerful, he believed the more people needed to be taken out.  Little did he know this was the beginning of his long and violent downfall.  Mark Bowden again delivers a book that reads very easy.  Full of information about hundreds of people involved with either Pablo's rise or Pablo's fall, Killing Pablo is one of the most informitive books I have read about beginning of the drug wars that have consumed the United States of America for now well over 10 years.  With the current escalating situation in South America, Killing Pablo is a great book to gain a better understanding of why exactly there are American soldiers down there.  I would recomend this book to anybody who enjoys furthering their knowledge of modern day wars, or who has enjoyed books like this, for example Black Hawk Down, in the past.  I give it 4 stars because it is not as good as Black Hawk Down, and doesnt deserve to be given and equal rating.  A very well done book though.
I read this during my Sophmore year.  At the time, and even still, it is by far one of my favorite books.  I have been a long time fan of war novels, but until I read Black Hawk Down no book really stood out as an excellent piece of literature.  Mark Bowden has an amazing talent to depict events that happened years ago as if you are in them in the middle of them while reading.  Black Hawk Down, as many of you probably know, is about the United States Special forces in Somalia in 1993 during a campaign to establish some sort of stability in the war torn region.  Black Hawk down is specifically about the day battle between Somalis and U.S. special froces after attempting to kidnap some prominent members of the powerful gang that went absolutely to hell.  Although Black Hawk Down is a very harsh read, it reads like an event you actually are participating in.  I woudl recomend Black Hawk Down to anybody who isd interested in Modern military history, or just military history in general.  If you have a weak stomach, there are parts of Black Hawk down that will be hard to swallow.  Black Hawk Down is one of my favorite books ever.
Night, by Elie Weisel, is a book different than any other I have read.  Many opinions about history, and even life in some cases changed while reading Night.  For a very long time I believed that Josef Stalin was the most evil man to live in the twentieth century.  After reading Night I believe that Hitler and his relentless \\"fight\\" to exterminate Hebrews from the face of the planet is the most evil act of hate ever.  Elie Weisel is a 12 year old boy living in the town of Sighet.  Untouched by Nazis until about 1942, Elie begins his long tour of numerous concentration camps throughout Europe.  This book is about the lengths a human will go through to survive.  Night is about love, hope, determination, and the spirit of humanity to survive, forgive, and to inform us, the readers, that we must never forget the lives lost during the years of Nazi occupied Germany.  We must never forget how 12 million people just like you and I were executed because of differences.  Night is a book that should eventually be read by all high school students.  I am still humbled by Night.
