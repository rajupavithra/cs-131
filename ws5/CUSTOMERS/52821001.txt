This is about the most simple book on Tithing I have ever read.  Every concept is Biblically based and cannot be argued with.  If you don't get the message of Tithing after reading this book, you never will!! Buy it and share it with your friends.
After going through this book I was amazed at how deceptive the author cleverly and cunningly distorts scripture as a basis of robbing God.  Of course this book will have a wide appeal to many in the church who are dull of hearing, lukewarm in heart and looking for loop holes NOT to tithe.  This book is clearly anti-God's Word and therefore anti-God.  The abundance of Scripture, both Old &amp; New Testaments are very plain - God expects every TRUE Believer to honor and obey Him with the tithe and promises great blessing for the tither.  <br />Don't waste your money on this un-Scriptural book.  Any thinking person reading this poorly written book can easily see the gaping holes in the author's twisted theology!  My advice to you is that you pay no attention to the author's WILD CLAIMS as he simply has no Biblical basis for his teachings.  Jesus warned us about FALSE teachers and FALSE prophets in the last days - so be warned!
