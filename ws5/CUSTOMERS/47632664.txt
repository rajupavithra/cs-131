From friends of mine, I find that the response to this book after reading it is &quot;excellent&quot; and &quot;spectacular.&quot;  I, for one, am not this far in the series but I just can't wait til I can finally read this book.  The build-up to it is tremendous and should be read by all.<br />After all the storyline changes as well as changes in main characters, this series still remains in my top 10.  The variety these books bring to us reader's is wonderful and the anticipation for the next book to arrive is always nerve-racking.  I totally love this series and this book I have heard is the best one by far.<br />As you can tell it is pretty convincing that &quot;The Mark&quot; is a definite must buy if you are reading the series &quot;Left Behind&quot; in the present time.  I recommend this book to people that believe a book can change your life....and this book and even series does that for you!  Thanks for reading this and please buy the book!

Guiness has yet again made a great book.  In its great monstosity and colorful fotos, the Guiness Book of Records for the year 2001 is a fun and education read.  This book is packed with feats mastered from around the globe with records set from anywhere between most days spent in an attic to farthest pull of a train with the use of teeth.<br />I really enjoyed looking at the broad pictures while reading what was being performed in the fotos.  These &quot;athletes&quot; from around the globe deserve a standing ovation for their wonderful talents and their kindness to publish their feats in a world renown book.<br />The Guiness Book of Records is really for any ages and offers a very convenient category index so you don't have to keep searching to find the record you want to look at.<br />As I have said, i really enjoyed this book and anyone who buys will feel the same.  Happy reading and thanks for looking at my review!

Shel Silverstein does it again.  This time with &quot;Where the Sidewalk Ends&quot;.  A great compelation of poems that will have you laughing throughout the day.  When I first picked this book up, I couldn't put it down for its gripping the reader techniques with such humorous poems.<br />With characters in his poems ranging from any animal to any human, this book definitely has variety.  I love the way Shel is able to rhyme things together and come up with such great stories in his poems......this is very evident in this book.<br />Most of th peoms run about half a page, some long, some short.  All of course, though, have humor and really show the work put in to them.  This poem book is one of Silverstein's finest and deserves some sort of award.<br />I want to thank Shel Silverstein for creating such a wonderful poem book and such great ideas that make you want to read the whole book in one sitting.  That would definitely take time though it would be worth it.<br />As you can see, I really recommend anyone of any age buying this book so they can enjoy it as much as I did.  Thank you for reading my review and have a nice day!!

Wrestler.  After hearing this word, what comes to mind?  Bodyslams, fake moves, swearing, etc.  Please folks, don't let the author,Mick Foley, fool you.  When you hear that a wrestler has just writtena book you automatically think &quot;Big deal&quot; unless you watchwrestling.  But believe me, this book is written way better then whatyou thought.<br /> Though Foley is a professional wrestler, he wrote adarn good book.  It's very long but very informational.  It'sbasically an autobiography which humor throughout.  The book goesthrough the life of Mick Foley and tells you all the pain and all thesuffering it took a man like Mick to make it to the WWF.<br />The booktells you about the different organizations he had to go through, ittold you how he got his connections to the WWF, and it even told mewho his first girlfriend was!<br />Honestly people, this wrestlerdeserves a big round of applause for writing such an awesome book.Sure, he swears pretty many times in it.  But hey, he does this inreality so why not put it in their so you know more about his image.I loved this book and I will again be reading it shortly.<br />This bookhas everything, everything a reader would want, of course.  Mick haspacked his whole life into a page-turner that i could not seem to putdown and people I have talked to did the same.  Once you start, youcan't stop reading.<br />I will say it for the last time.  This book, byMick Foley, is a definite must read for wrestling fans ornon-wrestling fans.  It really doesn't matter what your stature isbecause you will definitely love this book and will want to read more.Please pick it up and read it, I guarantee you will like it.<br />Thankyou very much for reading my review.
I just want to tell anyone that has the time to read this.  This book, Z for Zachariah, is definitely a book in my top 10.  It was well written and a great page-turner.  I just never could find the will to put it down.<br />Z for Zachariah is a book taking place right after a nuclear war.  A girl is left behind and thinking she is the only on left on earth.  That is until she sees a man drawing nearer and nearer to her house each and every day.<br />She is of course scared of him and hides so he doesn't see her.  Until one day when she is hiding in the mountains, he actually comes up to her yard, unloads his belongings and goes inside her house!  As first I was stunned by this but then I realized that he probably tought the house was abandoned.<br />They end up meeting eachother and story takes off from there.  It's just that, is this man as nice as she thinks he is?  You will find out later by prdering the book.<br />Z for Zachariah has a really good twist to it and I thought it was very creative on how the author approached on writing the book.  It has a lot of storylines, good storylines at that, that kept me and will keep you reading.<br />I want to thank Robert C O'Brien for creating such a well-written book.  Not all authors know how to grip a reader to keep reading like he did to me.  This is a definite must-read for all ages.<br />Definitely pick this book up and you will thank me that you did.
Wow.  That's a response that I made after reading the best book I have every read.  I, for one, have never been that religious.  I didn't like going to church, I didn't get all those religius books, etc.  But, when I found out about this book and read it, I just had to sit back and think about the world that we live it.  In this book, the world was able to finally come together and could finally be viewed at as a whole.  In our world today, we have violence across the streets all over.  Sometimes I wish I could live in the world the book described....until you find out what happens.<br />This book is the starting point of the anti-christ taking over and the rapture occuring.  Though it seems far-fetched at times, you have to remember that they authors, Tim LaHaye and Jerry B. Jenkins, got all of their information from the book of Revalation in the bible.<br />People in the book that did not follow the ten commandments and not be a true christian were Left Behind while the others that did the right deeds disappeared leaving their loved ones behind.<br />Left Behind gets sad at times and is a definite page turner.  I suggest this book to anyone that wants to turn their life around and come to realize that we aren't around forever.  If we want to make it to heaven, we need to make the right choices.  Left Behind showed me that and got me in the position that I am in today.<br />I thank you Tim LaHaye and Jerry B. Jenkins for creating such a life-like and moving book.  Currently I am in book 4 now and just love the series.<br />This book builds up suspense by going through things slowly and making you think more then you thought you ever could.  Honestly, everyone needs to sometime read this book and sit down and think.  Think about the situations you are in now.  What can you do to improve them?  This book shows you the way and deserves to be a best-seller which it most certainly is.<br />Please order this book today and you will never regret that you did.
