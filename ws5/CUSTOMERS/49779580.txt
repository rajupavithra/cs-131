I have some numbers that have been floatign through my life for awhile now.  I've won money with them, seen them countless times in their variants all around me (ex. I'll glance at the clock and it will be THE number, a car passes by it's the license plat, whacky stuff like that).  I had mentioned it to my mother but never the number specifically.  FInally in teh course of conversation I did and she tells me that it wa steh number that my dead aunt used to play----amazingly enough my aunt always told me that I could figure out Lotto and win---I had never made teh conenction before.  My mother then pointed out that within teh number was teh date of my aunt's death and my grandmother's, she sugegsted I get a numerology book to figure otu what the number meant to me as the same thing has different meanings to people (my experiences with my number have always been overwhlemingly positive or alerting).<BR>So after working out last night, I went and got this book and working out the name chart----no lie---came out to my NUMBER!<BR>This is a fantastic book, that I picked up randomly , it was even out of place at the bookstore because I didn't want to get confused as to what numerology book to try.  I'm sending not only my mother but friends copies of this as well.<BR>The book itself is simple, to the point and very concise with examples that lead you step by step to uncovering a host of numbers regarding your name, birthday, etc.. and the year things occured in, in the past, present or will in the future.<BR>This was suppose to be my budget---NO NEW BOOKS----week and it so floored me in the store that I bought it.<BR>I don't give high recommendations often but this one is worth it!  BUY IT!
I just got the Claremont/Silvestri/Ostrander/Hitch Brood Trade paperback.<br />CLaremont's is a good 3 issue arc and I can see how it both gives info on the story as well as boosts the sales for the ostrander/hitch 2 part brood issues/stories inside.<br />Ostrander is a good writer, i had his whole run on the Suicide Squad (where he got saddled with a bad artists) but though he has enthusiasm for the X-Men and a nice twist/new addition to the Brood mythos---the story lacks a bit in the characterization of the X-Men.  And also in the inventiveness in their fight against the Brood.<br />You would think with Cyclops and Storm on the team there would've been some more original teamwork than \\"CHARGE!\\".<br />The story itself was good as a quandry of what to do but I felt that the Brood were beat not too easily but without the X-Men really putting their backs into it.  The nice thing about a Claremont X-Men fight is that it's dog dirty and spreads out a bit and strategy is involved having that in the first part of the trade kinda upstaged the second part---it would've been nice if the first meeting with them was included as well.  Especially with Tigra joining the X-Men and the [demise] of Colossus and then the space fight.  I would've paid some more for the complete Brood arc to be included.  Also the New X-Men arc with Ghost Rider was cool too, should've been added.
A great book with lots of sound practical advice!  I've been very lucky over the years, by that I mean that I've had the opportunity to explore being an entrepreneur. I started when I was 14, a national magazine on a small scale and what I learned from that I would later articulate in other projects for publishing and even now on Amazon. I went to the Rich Dad seminar in New York this past November. I expected there to be an exhaustive push to purchase the various products available through his company but instead it was a full on lessons in business.  We were actually given workbooks and situations culled from the audience to look at how systems work and their business potential. <br />I will tell you what all of this has helped to congeal in my head. One, money does not exist. Now this may seem to be contradictory to the entire concept of what Kiyosaki's books seem to extort on the surface but it doesn't. Again this is a radical concept, but I think that after a certain number, money is simply a concept.  The majority of people think of working from paycheck to paycheck and what can be done with that money (after taxes usually 50% of one's annual number salary), unless you make a staggering amount you can't get ahead.<BR>What I think the RDPD series gives one the insight to do is recognize all of the systems you're in.  First what your money is, doing a spreadsheet on yourself and your worth, figuring out your goals and so forth and then the legal areas that affect your money.  Most people know how much they make weekly, what that number should be annually but we rarely keep track of WHY those numbers are affected as they are.  The difference between the rich and the poor is that the rich understand the power of their tax contributions and how much they absolutely have to make and how much they don't.<BR>   <BR>Rich people also think about money for sport not only for survival.  Here's a mental game I've learned to play: I imagine what businesses I would build ina neighborhood I'm in, what I can see that would work, what wouldn't, etc..---cost analysis evaluation of places. I also regualrly look at Lotto prizes and figure out exactly how much that money is----10 million after taxes, withholding= 4 or 5 million really isn't that much. <br />This is where it becomes interesting and the book delves into this: How to make money make more money? <BR>We all assume that getting a job is the easiest way to make money and then we assume that a business is so difficult to manage that we don't have the ability to do so. And yet amazingly, I started my first business when I was 7 selling papers, I would buy Sunday papers for 50 cents and sell them for 75 cents because I delievered the Sunday paper early in the winter. <br />Most people want answers. Answers the way your boss tells you to sit there, do this this way, deliver it by this time and then go home. Thats what people miss in this book----being told what to do. But ultimately they want to be TOLD what to do, become rich and then they will have the freedom to be \\"free to do whatever they want\\". Being free is everyone's greatest desire and fear. We have become a society that values conformity over creativity.<BR>People want to read this book and be told, put 5 dollars in a red box for ten years and you'll be a millionaire. Do this the right way and your life will be perfect. This isn't the way to be successful. There are ways of educatingone's self----first books like this. I recommend making a study of the entire Rich Dad Series. You must make a study of first money, then yourself, then what to do with both. <BR>I further recommend Tony Robbins Personal Power, Getting the Edge, Awaken The Giant because you must articulate what you want in the Universe. What if money is similar to the concept of the Matrix? What if the difference between me and John D. Rockefeller is a Universal expression of my potential in material manifestation?  Visulaization, understanding what money is, howto use it, how to grow, what real estate is, learning to think.<BR>I think I will end this lifetime as affluent.  Why? because not only have I maintained studying these kinds of books but because my video \\"games\\" are HSX.com, Entrepreneur PC game. I think that Kiyosaki SHOULDN\\"T answer questions such as numbers of what to do or how to do because life isn't about hand holding in the concept that people want it to be and honestly every person is different in terms of commitment level and ability. Did Obi Wan teach Luke how to transcend death or lift an X Wing fighter the first time? No. <BR>You have to understand business, law, taxes.  Really considering my investment future, what to do with money I may receive NEXT year in my tax returns, looking at my 401k plans and realizing that I could invest the money better, avoiding mutual funds and then designing an exit strategy for invested money---a concept pushed from the get go in RDPD----Enter Strategies, How Much You Need For the Lifestyle You Want and Exit Strategies. <BR>Thinking ahead.
My past reviews of the Anita Blake series have been back and forth between one and three stars because the series was developing, finding it's footing and developing of the character.  There are still flashes of the old problems here but it's far more under control.  This book was not only good in the places but pretty much as a book as a whole.  Though I will say I hedged my bet by buying it for 60% off and I will admit that there is still a lot of conversational psycho analyzing going on in the character's interactions.<br />There is a really interesting point of Anita having to open herself up sexually beyond simply a puritannical/Christian sense of one woman, one partner which is an interesting dynamic.  Also the concept of fluidic sexualities within the sphere of people she's around, there is a true pushing towards omnisexuality.  That's a great element of this book and how everyone's powers---vampires, werewolves, wereleopards, etc.---is so intrinsically linked to sex and emotional intimacy.  And that the literal focal point of all of this is someone who has prudish values to such free love and sex.<br />While Richard, teh werewolf king may seem like the stick in the mud to them truly being a team, the ultimate kind of family, I think he is the most human of them all.  He doesn't like what he is, what's around him, what he's been forced to become----there was no choice in it for him and I realized in his hesitations and depression and anger he is the most human of them all.  Unfortunately everyone else has made it so mandatory that he accept this whole lifestyle eventhough none of them else have regular lives outside of all of this weirdness.  It would be nice if the inherent selfishness of the group is explored in that it's ok that someone doesn't want to be a part of this world.<br />Onto the villainess, Belle Morte!<BR>I'm glad she didn't get a bullet in the head and is being saved as another problem for the future and this whole Mother of All Darkness is very interesting and it looks like it's part of Anita's destiny to be a link to all of these supernatural tribes to deal with this evil.  What I do find interesting is how everyone is pushing in their \\"vampire worlds\\" this ultimate Uber Evil (Angel, Buffy, here) and at the same time here in the book the government (rightfully so) is taking an interest in all of these factions and using them for their own means.  It's about time.<BR>I hope thatteh series doesn't shut down after a book or two because their are international dilemnas out there.  It's also a pet peeve of mine that for all of their talking and constant emotional analyzing they never TALK to each other.  They talk abotu themselves and push and pull but there are a couple of times in the novel where it would've been nice for Anita to pull Jean Claude aside and sit for a couple of hours to understand the vampire rules.  Sometyimes her ignorance is used as a device to tell the reader things that we don't know about this world but it also serves to keep the exposition going on for tooooooooo long.<BR>As always the criminal investigation of the book doesn't get underway until page 100-125 which if you pay attention to the pacing of previous novels is how it always happens, the predictability caused the loss of one star.  The hitman aspect of this was a little thin, thinner than most of the criminal plots of the book and more of harked back to characters that appeared in the beginning of the books to wrap up the end.  That was the weakest aspect of the book in that this whole other sub-plot was developed as something that I expect will ultimate appear in future books.<br />I was very pleased with this book, it has much more polish and isn't as reliant on Anita being able to shoot anyone and anything to beat it.  That showed a maturity of the work and it's nice to see Anita enjoying and accepting having so many varied lovers and the bonding of being part of a pack.  As I was reading the book, aside from the romantic part of this and the erotica, it was great to see Anita growing and questioning why she loves as she doesn, why she pushed people away.  It would be nice to see another female in the book to give another perspective on her---what ever happened to her best friend?<br />The children vampires, Valentina and Bartolome are an excellent addition to the cast of what is turning into a very unique \\"family\\".  I was thinking that this sort of village living and loving would be a great thing.
This is a good book.  Most people say that.  What works best at the heart of this book is how labor intensive it is.  It would be nice to see this kind of treatment turned onto say the XMen.
All of the parts of this book do come together as good and evil must make a working agreement to accomplish their tasks.  I enjoy Gaiman's work, thi sbeing his first work that I picked up.
Thsi was a really great book, I was surprised at the level of wit which it attained consistent.  i reccommend it as a light read.
I always hope that these books will improve.  This one is a marked improvement over the others plotwise.
One of the things I learned was about personal commitment to one's self.  By regards of others I may not have a huge amount of weight to lose but I've benn procrstinating about it and worried that this will become a lifestyle choice.  Sure I look fine now but I'm still pretty young and this has to be a lifelong commitment.  I got moving with Oprah and Bob in the 90's and did a massive turnaround but then I got into the work swing and got complacent, not to mention being so close to Delmonicos!  I love food, to eat it and to cook it but the simple mathematics is that I have to exercise more calories than I consume.  Simple as that.  And something really BIG, you're suppose to feel slightly hungry.  I think thats a great point, most peopel believe you're suppose to constantly be full.
I give it as gifts!  It will truly help you unfold your own potential and the universe around you.
Its nice to see the Viyager books developing though the big wuestion is whether or not they'll get a new life like DS9 has gotten thru the books.  Hoepfully so there's a lot that can be mined here and should be.
Troi suffered a lot in the series/show/movies.  Her empathy making her more of a subtle character than a brash one of gizmos and ideas like Data.  I'm thrille dthat in this book she finally got to shine and hopefully now she'll get a better treatment in the books than she ever did acted on screen.
Teh problem with Uncanny is that its Xmen leftovers. Angel?---the most dangerous XMan ever next to Iceman and Nightcrawler, with WOlverine thrown in to make sure someone will buy this book. Stacey X, the mutant prostitute with the heart of gold?...I mean really. Teh interestign part of adding the Jugegrnaut to the team is a nice touch, something original darting it's head in. But this book lacks direction. New X-Men seems to be about the future of teh Xmen and Xtreme seems to follow the theme of self-manifestation and determination and Uncanny seems to be about all the Xmen you would never call on to save theworld. Now if that were followed up on and this was the B team that no one had much faith in that would be cool. Adding some New Mutants,, XForce members, Generation X (they chose Husk over Jubilee and Monet---ugh! and here she's proven to be rather dunderclass). There's no spark here. Its Xmen drudgery. Against Black Tom and his amazing plant powers. Then Lobo wolf men with the most assinine, self-pontificating write overs about evolution. Thsi should be the dirty team, teh schizos, the mess ups, the forgottens doing dirty work, the stealth team, instead it's the yellow bus, reject Xmen. The addiiton of Northstar is a nice twist in the right direction but the whoel team needs to be those kinds of twists. Throw in some villains, some humans (you know I've always wondered about that part----for all their co-existence, peaceful harmony talk there are no human members of the team---this would be a good place to experiement with that concept. We keep getting the human perspective from Xmen, we shoudl get it from humans. They need a token memeber.)<br />Though this review is for New XMen, I have to say that Uncanny and Extreme average overall into my rating of 4 stars. I know there's been a lot of hullabaloo about Morrison's work on New X-Men---new directions, excitement, blah blah. However I'm not so sure much has changed so radically. By measuring change I mean if Morrison didn't write anymore issues would there be a vast change in the X-Men. Ok, Emma Frost as a member is fun and a good twist, however I think that the creation of new characters and the wholesale tossing out of others (like the New Mutants, who're comign back in yet another series to run 50-100 issues and be cancelled along the lines of New Mutants, Generation X and X-Force) rather than integrating them eventually into the team. I think this is the main deficit of teh XMen. Characters created that are likeable, taht are durable, eventually can't be changed in any significant way.<br />Prof. X having a twin sister who is wholesale evil was nice, though from the first panel Cassandra appeared in, I knew who and what she was. Maybe I've been reading comics too long to be surprised too deeply..........<br />There was a HUGE, I mean HUGE storyline buildup to Cassandra stealing the Prof.'s body and returning with the Shiar to wax the Xmen out. And teh fight was.........ehhhhh....not that scary. I mean everyone pretty much stayed status quo. Morrison is twisting but not changing. At least in Xtreme, Psylocke is dead, dead, dead. Jean is having Phoenix trips again, Beats is upset because he's hideous, Wolverine is all violence talk and menace and Emma is a nice bit of relief as someone who's been there, done that. Cyclops, easily teh most boring person at a party is purposefully written as stiff, which is interesting and his affair with Emma, another interesting point but will he and Jean divorce over this? Nope. Status quo.<br />My measure of a great writer is that when you look back on the 20-50 issues they've done is it an entirely new playing field? Is anything of consequence changing?<br />Ok, the school is out and officially a mutant academy, which has possibilities but in many ways over the years it has been outted, just not as crowded. A lot of teh X-Men's main stable of enemies are either gone, dead or well........X-Men. So it makes you wonder what a real threat is going to be. This book dialogue wise and visually is sometimes good, even great and the overall plottin gof a maturing X-Men being more present in the world is interesting but I don't feel a sense of danger, a sense of forboding. I mean my big question is when a threat arrives, honestly, does anyone reading this book feel like someone might not survive? That Cyclops and Phoenix will break up? That Beast really might be gay? There are playful twists, stunts, but not true change going on.<br />Cassandra, a serious threat was defeated too easily, and by easily, I mean there was very little collateral damage that we got to see. Supposedly she rendered tne Shiar empire to rubble, that should've been part of what the readers SEE not just were told. Good writing shows you not just tells you. Essentially compressing Cassandra into a mental file inside of a metamorph was unique but somehow too easy. Then again, I have to wonder why Emma, Phoenix and Prof. X together couldn't fight her? Morrison is a good writer, I agree and I'm sure a lot of the things he's done have been uphill battles, unfortunately the XMen are stuck in their own quaqmire of history and static characterizations. It would have been really interesting to see this new Cyclops who had been part of Apocalypse. That theme was explored for two minutes but not truly cracked open.<br />Also is it just me or has anyone ever considered that these young people are the Prof's puppets? Wouldn't someone so telepathically formidable leak his desires to those around him? That would be an excellent area to be explored.ng to be.

I like Data, and this book took a nice twist on him and explored all artificial life forms in the Star Trek universe, which was a nice surprise.

A nice stand alone story that had me rivetted to finish it and to further explore the issues, hopefully, in subsequent editions.
Thsi book is basically to fill in the holes in the whole Gorn mythos.  The huge reptiles that never quite played well enough on TV to be spotlighted before.  Its a reasonably good story but nto anything to write home about.

A lot of teh X-Men's main stable of enemies are either gone, dead or well........X-Men. So it makes you wonder what a real threat is going to be. This book dialogue wise and visually is sometimes good, even great and the overall plottin gof a maturing X-Men being more present in the world is interesting but I don't feel a sense of danger, a sense of forboding. I mean my big question is when a threat arrives, honestly, does anyone reading this book feel like someone might not survive? That Cyclops and Phoenix will break up? That Beast really might be gay? There are playful twists, stunts, but not true change going on.<BR>Cassandra, a serious threat was defeated too easily, and by easily, I mean there was very little collateral damage that we got to see. Supposedly she rendered tne Shiar empire to rubble, that should've been part of what the readers SEE not just were told. Good writing shows you not just tells you. Essentially compressing Cassandra into a mental file inside of a metamorph was unique but somehow too easy. Then again, I have to wonder why Emma, Phoenix and Prof. X together couldn't fight her? Morrison is a good writer, I agree and I'm sure a lot of the things he's done have been uphill battles, unfortunately the XMen are stuck in their own quaqmire of history and static characterizations. It would have been really interesting to see this new Cyclops who had been part of Apocalypse. That theme was explored for two minutes but not truly cracked open.<BR>Also is it just me or has anyone ever considered that these young people are the Prof's puppets? Wouldn't someone so telepathically formidable leak his desires to those around him? That would be an excellent area to be explored.
I really enjoyed it.  It was very original and the characters were neat, and I mean that in a superhero kind of way.  Pick up a copy, they're hard to find but worth teh effort.
Teh problem with Uncanny is that its Xmen leftovers.  Angel?---the most dangerous XMan ever next to Iceman and Nightcrawler, with WOlverine thrown in to make sure someone will buy this book.  Stacey X, the mutant prostitute with the heart of gold? ....  Teh interestign part of adding the Jugegrnaut to the team is a nice touch, something original darting it's head in.  But this book lacks direction.  New X-Men seems to be about the future of teh Xmen and Xtreme seems to follow the theme of self-manifestation and determination and Uncanny seems to be about all the Xmen you would never call on to save the world.  Now if that were followed up on and this was the B team that no one had much faith in that would be cool.  Adding some New Mutants, XForce members, Generation X (they chose Husk over Jubilee and Monet---ugh! and here she's proven to be rather dunderclass).  There's no spark here.  Its Xmen drudgery.  Against Black Tom and his amazing plant powers.  ....   The addiiton of Northstar is a nice twist in the right direction but the whoel team needs to be those kinds of twists.  Throw in some villains, some humans (you know I've always wondered about that part----for all their co-existence, peaceful harmony talk there are no human members of the team---this would be a good place to experiement with that concept.  We keep getting the human perspective from Xmen, we shoudl get it from humans.  They need a token memeber.)<BR>Though this review is for New XMen, I have to say that Uncanny and Extreme average overall into my rating of 4 stars. I know there's been a lot of hullabaloo about Morrison's work on New X-Men---new directions, excitement, blah blah. However I'm not so sure much has changed so radically. By measuring change I mean if Morrison didn't write anymore issues would there be a vast change in the X-Men. Ok, Emma Frost as a member is fun and a good twist, however I think that the creation of new characters and the wholesale tossing out of others (like the New Mutants, who're comign back in yet another series to run 50-100 issues and be cancelled along the lines of New Mutants, Generation X and X-Force) rather than integrating them eventually into the team. I think this is the main deficit of teh XMen. Characters created that are likeable, taht are durable, eventually can't be changed in any significant way.<BR>Prof. X having a twin sister who is wholesale evil was nice, though from the first panel Cassandra appeared in, I knew who and what she was. Maybe I've been reading comics too long to be surprised too deeply...... Morrison is twisting but not changing. ... Jean is having Phoenix trips again, Beats is upset because he's hideous, Wolverine is all violence talk and menace and Emma is a nice bit of relief as someone who's been there, done that.

Teh problem with Uncanny is that its Xmen leftovers. Angel?---the most dangerous XMan ever next to Iceman and Nightcrawler, with WOlverine thrown in to make sure someone will buy this book. Stacey X, the mutant prostitute with the heart of gold? LOL Thsi Uncanny series is [just bad]. I mean really. Teh interestign part of adding the Jugegrnaut to the team is a nice touch, something original darting it's head in. But this book lacks direction. New X-Men seems to be about the future of teh Xmen and Xtreme seems to follow the theme of self-manifestation and determination and Uncanny seems to be about all the Xmen you would never call on to save the world.

Against Black Tom and his amazing plant powers. Then Lobo wolf men with the most assinine, self-pontificating write overs about evolution. Thsi should be the dirty team, teh schizos, the mess ups, the forgottens doing dirty work, the stealth team, instead it's the yellow bus, reject Xmen. The addiiton of Northstar is a nice twist in the right direction but the whoel team needs to be those kinds of twists.

And teh fight was.........ehhhhh....not that scary. I mean everyone pretty much stayed status quo. Morrison is twisting but not changing. At least in Xtreme, Psylocke is dead, dead, dead.

I really liked this book though the mysteries were more or less open and shut, it was how people thought of them, moralized through them.  Lucy, the daughter comes off as a bit incredible, in her talents and religious convictions but it's a nice addition.  The concept that a teenager is thinking deeply on the Universe was a welcome change.  I would definitely keep my eyes open for another book about this family.
This is a great book with lots of helpful scenarios and tips on breaking the ice in chatting someone up.  I enjoyed this book so much, and found that so many of the tips worked ...
Though the take on the story is original, I wasn't that impressed with it. The plot itself has a nice twist on teh amnesia trick but the twist of timetraveling really didn't live up to its' premise for me.  A good, lazy, easy read that shoudl be purchsed used and new.
Marrianne Williamson's work is both real and honest.  Rather than couch things in a concepts that are alien or extremely religious, she talks to you about the realities of existing.  Of how things will not always be easy, about how you will lose your way, and honestly how to see people clearly.  Growth is messy, it's not neat, maturity is not easy, nor is spirtiuality delicate work, but with assistance from a tape like this you can see yourself clearly and how to bridge yourself from concept to human to spiritual being.

I listened to this tape again this weekend and what stood out for me was telling the truth.  The real truth of who I am, what I want someone else to know about me.  Taking off the masks as it were.  I wa sthinking about this in relationship to dating as it's the huge topic amongst my friends and exploring why different peopel are successful in being in relationship and even getting into them and why others have successful relationship.  I'm single and love the dates I go on, finding them to be wonderful experiences for getting to know someone, to revealing myself.  Though I have other friends that have a cynicism about it, that fear that intimacy and engagement.  Its funny, in some ways, tellign the TRuth, being like Hey, this is me.  I dress nicely for dates and not a slob because of both self value and teh art of showing up and sometimes being on a date with someone who doesn't hold that value and worse yet criticizes me for doing so and standing firm in that.  I don't show up in tux but I do dress well, in fact I honestly like clothes, nice ones not as a flaunting of my money or financial progress in life but because certain fabrics feel and fit better.  However the lack of discussion and the fact that people assume judgment made me question my appearance a few times.  Thsi tape, talking about the Truth of who you are, telling someone the Truth when you show up made me really reflect back on that.  I've ha dthese tapes for years, been listenign to them for at least 10 years and every once in awhiel I pull them out and spend some time with them.  There's an African word for learning something on one level one day and then on an entirely different and deeper level the next and the next after that.  That's how I view this tape series.<br />Marianne Williamson's work is both real and honest.

I think what makes thsi book very good is that it crosses over with the other series books, in a wide spanning tale.  Though of course it might've neeeded much more room for everyone to truly shine, it does show a great side of Sisko and Dax and the conundrum of time travel as well as Earthly mythology and wher ethat may've come from.  An interesting plot and good read.
Another passable book as the written series was trying to find its feet.  The Hortas explored in the first Star Trek series are brought back here.  The logic of bringing creatures on board a space station who can bore through anything is questionable and again its the Cardassians who are throwing a wrench into the plans.  <BR>It took awhile for the written series to find it's own feet, amazingly enough when the series went off of TV and was dependent upon the written series as the sole outlet.
Again the books were trying to find themselves.  Though the Defiant gave the characters more mobility in a plot sense, this revisiting of Sisko's past didn't necessarily suggest perfection.  It takes time to develop a new concept for characters that are being fixed in the public consciousness.  This book tried to bring in some of Sisko's past, the past being an area thatthe book writer's can explore without fear of destroying some precious future episode.  And though theres a heavy feeling of mourning, it's also nice to see how Sisko interacts with another crew.
A good concept for a story that doesn't develop well enough to be thsi short of a book.  Basically they spend most of their time hidden and then escape in the nick of time.  I wished that this book would've been better, it had the potential to be greater and unfortunately the ideas didn't always live up to the promise of what I think the writers wanted them to.
The part of the book that is meant to be the real twist is Worf's brother being part of the attack force.  The idea that Worf will perhaps betray the Federation or go lightly against the invading force because of the sibling relationship.  The concept of a point that would test people's moral standing and commitment is the crux of most Star Trek books and stands true here as well.   Of course betrays the Federation, sides with his brother and helps to overthrow and destroy all of his past comrades.
I really liked this one.  Quark is a great character and a fair representation of the capitalistic world we live in brought to a fiuture where that rampant greed isn't necessary.  It was nice to see the further development of the character by the man who played the character.
Again the books were lost.  Cardassian focus.  Mixed crisises.  Focus on a character that hadn't bene focused on in a book yet seemed to be the choice but in the end that didn't necessary mean it was a hood thing.
There was a theme for awhile in the books series about the Cardassians always beign behidn some nefrious plot, kind of like 1940's films constantly casting Nazi's as the enemy.  Because they had been the enemy but looked at as a whole, it did tend to wear after a while.  This one in particular did not advance further, staying within the static bubble of a mission that changes nothing.  The stauts quo must be maintained at the end.  Also the introduction of the Defiant ship did open up the tv series and the books as well.<BR>This book is fun but only passable.
This book occurred a couple of years into the series so the characters were still being fleshed out so the focus was more on finding new missions to write about.  While everything was traced back to Cardassian involvement showing the same narrow focus that the first few seasons did.  Also the books needed to get broader in scope and characterization.  This book was a slow start and the only part that was true to the series was the Quark and Odo conflict.
When I first began the Millenium trilogy, a scant two weeks ago I was a little disappointed. The first book has so much going on from so many vantage points that I didn't know how it related to either the overall premise or the forthcoming continuing novels. Boy was I surprised by Book II which at some points reminded me of Stephen King's The Stand where the DS9 crew is reduced to watching helplessly as their universe past/present/future crumbles at the hands of Kai Weyoun. Book III---Inferno goes even further because it tackles what is at the heart of understanding The Prophets, the Celestial Temple, Capt. Sisko's existence, the whole DS9 mythos which boils down to non-linear time. The concept of time having to be first explained to the Prophets and then their comprehending it enough so that they can teach/reveal/manipulate Sisko that what is always has been, what shall be is and that there is no what and that there always has been a thought that is staggering for a tv series/serial novel to accomplish. But the authors pull it off with an aplomb and yet a technical knowledge of physics and technobabble that makes it all comprehensible. It's good to see that the DS9 crew all experience different ideas of faith, belief in whether or not the Prophets are true \\"Gods\\" or merely interferring/insane aliens because it fosters a belief that all beliefs should be respected. One man's religion being anothers science. Even at the most desperate of times, Sisko and crew fight against the Pah-Wraiths destructive intent but never they're right to believe, a critical distinction. And the crew, particularly Sisko and to a heavy science bent Jadzia Dax and the surprising twist character of Commander Arla continuously question the Prophets, their pre-destined path for him and the world of Bajor that allows this final installment to securely lock with the two before into a terrific, wryly funny, dark, poignant story about faith and how the universe is bigger than any one crew. The DS9crew (including Quark (who is both heroic and understandibly terrified, Nog (a boy/future Captain who risks literally everything to becming one of teh progenitors of all Bajoran faith with admiral Jean Luc Picard and the thief/vamp Vash, the hilariously dark Garak and Rom (who Garak secretly suspects is a master Ferengi scientist hiding as a dimwit)hurled through time, non-time, space, life and death have an intrinsic bond of group humanity/integrity/humor that makes them rival the original Star Trek Enterprise crew. A nice point about these novels is that it occurs a year in DS9 time before the final show so lots of plot points and foreshadowings are filled in to make the time spent with this crew even more rich to the serious fan. I am a serious Sisko fan, Avery Brooks fan, from way before DS9 but he embodies a captain, a father, a man, and to some degree though it isn't overtly stated, a Black man (the thought of Sisko being a discriminated against sci-fi writer of the early 20th century who is merely imagining/scrawling the DS9 adventures on a wall that Sisko's son, Jake will one day write as a book himself four hundred years in the future about a man in the 1950's who is a discriminated against Black sci-fi writer who writes about DS9 is chilling, non-linear and equisitely managed and bent and twisted and toyed with so that you actually leave with several fully co-existing, non-conflicting, non-linear beliefs about exactly what's going on. Forget STTNG, DS9 would be the hit Star Trek film Paramount is looking for! Makes you wonder what's going on with Voyager (Seven, Janeway and the Doctor pop up here too).

The concept of soldiers hidden within DS9 coming to life and emobodying an age old rage is original and makes the book stronger than most of the series lot.<BR>What I did appreciate about this book is Diane Carey's work, she is one of the better Star Trek writers because her books tend to be more thoughtful and drawn on.<BR>I recommend this book for the on target characterization it has as well as the strong writing.  Sisko really comes to life on these pages.
Nice focus on Keiko and Worf who were new to the series but it was more of an episode filler than a full blown book.  It had a good balance between characters that were associated from the past and the way in which they had grown and were embarking on a new relationship in a new place.  The hard balance of these series books is that they can't change anything so they have to be static to a time and everyone may be challenged but can't have anything of massive signifigance happen to them.  This is both an artistic limitation and inherent ST series in books flaw that unfortunately is only solved when the shows are no longer on.  One reality must be sacrificed for the other.
Originally Michelle Forbes was to go from Star Trek Next Generation to the Deep Space Nine show when she quit, Kira Nerys was created.  So this book is sort of tongue in cheek.  Unfortunately the blending of so many writers convolutes not the plot but the tone of the novel.  Though it's not apparent who wrote what to avoid particular criticisms all of these writers, while versed in Star Trek have different styles.<BR>So this book fails.

I've always enjoyed Claremont's writing and Larroca's art seems pretty godo to me.  Though I do believe that the exploding breasts have gone a bit too far.<BR>As stated above this is an Invasion themed storyline, originally 7 issues.  Now there have been points where I found teh piecemeal that the stories go through, an issue a month, exhausting.  But for this poarticular storyline, I foudn it rushed.  This could've been a full year's worth of stories.  Though I do credit Claremont with taking his time to develop this story, there was a lot more to be mined here.  Part of the problem seems to be Larroca's art is so dynamic and full that it tends to take up several pages showing a vareity of things.  While this is great to look at, it happers story development because issues run from only 18-22 pages.<BR>The best part of this story is how Claremont touches on a Storm of old.  Through other writers, she's been hurling lightning bolts and gusts of winds but here Khan's heiroom attacks her and she uses her minimal powers and her skills with a knife to beat them all.  That was impressive.  Equally impressive was Sage who watches Storm be attacked by the traitorous Viper and does nothing.........Claremont leaves this point unclear.  Did Sage theorize that Storm would do better on the inside of Khan's organization or is there something more sinister at work?  Gambit trapped as an energy conduit for the transport system for the invasion to materialize was very well handled and teh appearance of Vargas, showing up at the wrong time to pick a fight was good as well.<BR>Lifeguard and Slipstream while getting their first real exposure are given short shrift afterwards.  Lifeguard maturing into a Shiar warrior and Slipstream using his powers for the first time is completing with all of these other storylines.  Thunderbird doesn't get much to do here other than be the resident back up blaster, and teh same for Bishop.  I'm not sayign that Claremont doesn't like them, I'm just saying that even Rogue gets jumpstarted by Sage and develops further.  Are Bishop and Thunderbird at their character development limit?  I also like to see a writer develop power stunts for characters that uses their abilities in new and interesting ways.  Thunderbird can fly and fire plasma bolts and Bishop redirects energy through guns (still a questionable visual for me--------he's always with a HUGE gun and an angry black man grimace, just because he's an ex-soldier doens't mean that this has to be his  constant way of appearing.  It would be interesting to seeing a subtle Bishop.)<BR>More issues, the two that follow this trade paperback being a wrap up of Vargas and an emergency medical/life after death/vist from the New X-Men wasn't as necessary immediately after such a great storyline.<BR>Even Khan gets shorted by his demise being off-scene, which means he's still alive.  And the fact that there needed to be some real scenes of what it would take to stop a multitude of worlds from taking over another.  There were stories to be mined here of a couple of the X-Men on one of the good enslaved worlds and a bad one.  Also more on the Madripoor resistance and Viper.  Red Lotus gets bounced and forgotten by Shaitan and then Shaitan in Storm guise gets beaten and kidnapped by Vargas.  Anyoen who's read the other issues knows that Vargas and Storm spar with swords in one of Destiny's Diaries, also Lifeguards metamorphosis promises Shiar trip and the shot from the Diaries looks like Kitty Pryde will be back in the X-Men but under the hands of Claremont which is sensational.  She does make an appearance a couple of issues later and the Mekanix limited series is written by Claremont.<BR>What I can say is that Claremont excels at such huge storyline arches.  Unfortunately because attention spans can be so limited.  While I wouldn't have minded this being 9 issues and then the abyssmal Xtreme Xpose issues as a break to give Larroca time to catch up, I did really enjoy Claremont and though I see how Larroca's art can dominate over story time and outlines, I do love his work too.  A couple of double-sized issues would've given more time to this impressive story.<BR>My complaints?<BR>The X-Men get sucked in to the whole thing a little too easily----Storm's Ruby, Shaitan attacks--BAM! Invasion.  But there was no preamble to this coming about.  Shaitan maybe attacking them a couple of times before for no clear reason would've been a good lead in.  Viper having attacked Storm and organizing Madripoor was good but she needed to be more involved throughout the story, rather than just a minor evil, it would've been nice to see her be in the thick of it and how her tactics might be necessary to win a war.  Also a few Madripoor victims and characters from the Wolverine series and development of the island would've been cool.<BR>I give it 4 stars because the art nudged out the story, when a bit more economy could've made this a classic along the lines of the Dark Phoenix saga.  Unfortunately death is big here as a cliffhanging monumental issue.  That would've been cool.  What about if time passed differently in Khan's realm?  And Storm had a child?  That would've been quite the development.  I hate HUGE stories where afterwards other than bruises the main characters haven't changed in any hugely significant way.  Sure Rogue's powers are out of whack now but they'll be back or perhaps there will be a truly adventurous twist and she'll have to absorb new powers from now on.  It was also a nice development to at the end of this issue give her control over absorbign powers, it's been tooooooooooooo long in the coming.
This book is bad.<BR>It's bubonic plague bad.<BR>Ok, imagine that a nuclear bomb has exploded.  You're left alive.  Your flesh is decaying, you're sick, you're blind.  The book is a little worse than that.<BR>Why is the book bad?  We could blame the publisher but that would to easy.  We could even blame the writer however this is her BEST idea, so we shouldn't.  Instead, lets blame Terry McMillan.  Yes, I said it, Terry McMillan.  as you may have noted this book's cover has changed from the initial photograph which highlighted the victim----oooh, I mean protagonist Gwen, it is now three multi colored \\"sistahs\\" and the line notes are now about their \\"struggle\\".<BR>Who started this wave of multi-hued \\"sistahs\\" and their struggles?  Terry McMillan.  Who is propogating this wave?  Bad writers.<BR>Now lets talk about the book.  Gwen spends most of the book as a victim freely sharing herself sexually with men under the most dubious of circumstances.  She tends to lie and manipulate and perpetuate herself as a victim to the point of being destructive to the image of black women.  This book is horrendous and I recommend that one not only NOT buy a copy but also warn off friends and family.  The quality of the writing is rather juvenile as well,I don't mean to lambast the book but it deserves it and I am ashamed to see the quality of what readers will accept.  These self-same readers aren't picking up the writers that are truly of quality, exploring the issues of race and gender.  I could name a few but this doesn't strike me as the readership conducive area.
No one seems to mention how Natalie takes in a little Black girl to raise as part of conquering her suburban blues.  That very act alone and the stereotypes are insulting.  Or perhaps thsi is how White people think ALL people who are Black would be?  I doubt it but thats the first major flaw.<BR>The second is the lack of depth Peter shows to Natalie.  i fthey were totally together and he was a shave dumber you could understand all of her manipulations working.  But him having some smarts makes everything seem like a set-up for her insanity which is ultimately contrived and silly.  She suddenly gets money when she needs to bug his place, her kidnapping and imprisonment of Peter and Lloyd's militia rescue...all a bit trite.<BR>Lets not even touch the wilding Latino gang that she gives a freebie to in order to maintain the gay one's machismo in the gang.  It's sickening.  All the races are stereotypes and disgusting while Peter and Lloyd could fly with angel wings if teh book oepned too fast.<BR>Also the concept that there is no play from the inner workings of their relationship.  Using Natalie as the ploy ultimately wear sthin because everything is from her eprspective, which is warped and some things that need to be explained become inexplicable.<BR>The whole pity over certain kinds of women clutching to gay men is attacking and pathetic too because it never supposes genuine relationships of human beings, just gay to straight, lose rto winner, man to woman.  This book is misogynistic is truth as all of the women are settlers or fools, even Natalie's boss who has a gay husband, or downtrodden Black girls with thug boyfriends.<BR>The problem with gay literature is that it has only so many veins because the writer pushes the whole gay thing.  Satire/lark, coming out story, fetish clique insights or lurid drama with gay sex.  Even the sex scene in this book is incomprehensible.  Why write about people, including gay people, if they're just going to be caricatures.<br />The one star saving grace of this whole book is Lloyd's realistic arguments, his thoughts.  Though not necessarily agreeable to all, it shows some depth.  Unfortunately so much work went into Lloyd and Natalie as polarities that they stretch to the point of unrealistic.
Inspired by a newspaper story where a woman stabbed a dead woman at the funeral, Morrison tackles obsession, vitriolic hatred manifested as marrings.  The marring of a deep love by an affair, the marring of the mistress, the marring of Violet's reputation/identity by her actions throughout the community that once embraced her.<BR>To defend, to attack a live mistress/sexual opponent is acceptable but when one's husband has killed hsi mistress to hold the love in amber, is madness.  A madness that goes deeper than what we can imagine. <BR>Or can we?<BR>In Tar Baby, the topic was love and loving with White people as the background, a white canvas, if you will but here, it is Black on black canvas.  Cry for freedom by traveling from the South as a loving couple, cry for release through a 50 year old man finding love with an 18 year old girl and then cry vengeance with a capital V for Violet.  Hot like hot chocolate in hell, thsi book is jazz, hits its mark with the improvisation, the dance of the sentences that are no longer simply poetry but now notes, harmony, lyrics, melody dancing along the ceiling, on the wall as shadows, as figures entwined first 1 then 2 then 3 then 2 then a solitary one again.  Bebop, bebop.  4 beat to 8 beat to 16 beat then to 8 then to 4.  Improved as scat through Coltrane, a love supreme, a love supreme, a love supreme.
Can you be a woman in the South, in the early part of the century fo America.  America that holds us close and bites our csouls trhough our flesh.  Passion, sexual freedom in a lover too young, too young to be anything but a transition, a transition to freedom.  A Black love story, Black literature that throbs, that vibrates with power, and ends with the baptism of the land, of Janie.  Washing away tears of infidelity, of grief, of dread, of poverty, of fear and replacing them with the eyes that were watching God and God looked down and cried onto the land, onto Janie onto the fields where her fingers had bled, where her hands had split, where her tongue was kept silent and held to converse life and moisture.<BR>Share your freak with whomever because it's a beautiful thing.
Race, from being black, not white, called black as opposed to brown or tan or cafe or cafe au lait or mocha or chocolate or obsidian even, is not a good thing.  What is black?  Does anyone not Black truly yearn to be Black?  Come on, honestly?  But White, as in Caucasian, that is the desire, the passion that graces magazines covers.  Count the White faces, the colored eyes, the blonde hair and then look at the irony of the suntanned skin.  Present in shade...slightly but denied in form.<br />Pecola yearns to be White, not just for the physical form, I think the title distracts the initial reader as too literal, she yearns for it working out, for life being fair, for being eligible to be on magazine covers, one day television, in movies, in power, in control.  Hair and eyes are just the ink on the admissions ticket.<br />Children today, this day, teenagers across the country, play at Black.  The slang, supposing that they are speaking jive, that rap music makes them down, that knowing, touching, dating Black makes them the tabooed Other.  Baggy pants, name brand plastered clothing.  We shall overcome?  Ha!  We shall succumb, succumb to a hypocrisy that is as twisted and amazing and mazed as the beauty in all shades, from chalk to chocolate.<br />Perhaps my children, whatever color or combination of colors they may will look up at me with blue eyes and they won't be alien, they won't be strange, they won't be the Other, they will be embraced.  For ultimately Pecola wants to be embraced.  Embraced by parents, friends, love.  And yet she is in America, a country which is still divided over which children to embrace, which faces to spread white, brown, yellow...etc, etc..<br />And still I, ME! ME!  Still I rise everyday.  And thats the built in irony to being Black, knowing that tomorrow whether you're in the South or the North, poor or rich, pretty or ugly, you must get up, get up, get up even if your hair isn't blond eand your eyes aren't blue.  But like Pecola, sometimes, on the fringe of a day, on the edge of a glance of suspicion, or a clutched purse as wealth bulges silently in my wallet, or someone who tells me how incredible I am but that they would never date or be attracted to Black as if I am a Martian, as if I lack humanity enough to be considered, I wonder as I wander about having eyes of azure and hair the color of urine.
What is a man?<BR>What is a Black man?<BR>Could you die with dignity?<BR>Die a man?<BR>Wait for death to come to you, look it square in the eye and know that there was no escape.  Sit with your life and say to Death: \\"I greet you, I face you?\\"<BR>I both read this book and taped/watched the film.  Honor, integrity of spirit is necessary to be alive here, to be real here, to be present in one's life.<BR>Am I a man?<BR>If I'm a Black man am I nothing but a hog as in this book the boy is accused of being?  All his grandmother can dois ask Teacher to make him a man, to grow him in a hurry so that a child is not slain, a fool isn't hung but a man says, \\"I am.  Now you may, may, kill this body.  For I have been it and left it already.\\"<BR>I cried at the end of this book, barely finished the last few pages because it is both love story and testament to love of self, love of manhood, love of being a man beyond race.  But how hard it is to be a Black man, how so hard.  Perhaps our man and womanhood can only be faced and accounted for when death seems imminent.<BR>If so, then a man was lead to the chair, to the tree, to the shooting post, for it matters that one dies but HOW one dies.<BR>Read this book then go to Ellison, Wright, Hughes, Morrison, Baldwin, Faulkner, Mailer, Garcia-marquez, etc. al.  Please.
Deep Space Nine isn't about pedantic droning on and on, it was the official action series. The wild, wild west of Star Trek. Thsi story makes it as boring as TNG where there is minimal damage to all involved. If Vaughn is so secret ops that he can refuse a captaincy, then how come he's not more dangerous, more manipulative. There's got to be a good space between the audacity of Kirk and Calhoun and the supreme balances of Picard and Sisko. DS9 is crawling along. These stories seem shadowy, willowy, like there is a towering giant of past stories of quality hovering over these stories whgich is why they aren't simply weaker but overshadowed. What does the series need? Direction! Maybe one writer holding this series for a year at a time, taking it into directions unexplored before. But the mix and match of timidity is ruining potential characters really breaking out. All of these books have been about characters upset at who they are and DS9 was about people upset by the galaxy around them and who they were becoming.<BR>The series straddles trying to hark back to the past without creating it's own identity. It's time for it to be a book unto itself.
Name the big Black romance novels.  I dare you.  Name them all.  Ok, five, name five romance novels centralized around Black characters, in love, loving, making love, living well, being well that doesn't have four women as successful best friends?<BR>Go ahead, I'll wait.<BR>Toni Morrison is not easy.  Do not mistake her ever for easy, do not mistake her subject matters for simple to pierce or to understand.  I agree with the previous reviewer, people expect books to be like TV.  And they aren't.  Good books anyway.  Books that are literature.  This book is literature.<BR>Hopefully more will come along, more romance that mean something, that say something about culture, about color, about power and the abuses.<BR>Son is all of the projected racial fears and Jadine is the homogenized Black America wants Black people to be/to become.  Grateful and still on some level serving in the kitchen (Sydney and his wife).  Black people are required to be so much within this world, this America.  Savage, erudite, butler, maid/cook and yet all of the characters here in the book, that are White, are one form (rich) here.  White is a decision to be, to be a thing, rich, poor, bohemian, angry, depressed, rebllious, vane, but all that is shiftable, malleable.  Black however is static from White perception and being Black from the inside out?  That's birth from a dead womb.
I recently went to a Rich Dad Seminar where half a dozen experts spoke, including, Mr. Sutton.  His advice and thoughts were thoughtful, purposeful and sanguine.  I particularly learned that for my own business purposes the structure which was necessary.  The differences and uses of a S Corp, C Corp and so on (LLC, LLP) were explained and outlined to my ecstatic satisfaction.  I recommend this book for anyone who is thinking about starting a business or who already has.  What he will teach you is invaluable and the book itself is a tax deduction.  It also contains a special deal to use his national firms resources.  I think it would also behoove a businessperson to obtain all of the Rich Dad Series of books.  For around a hundred dollars you can get a clear picture of what is necessary to think, know and feel for a business as well as what to do with money and where to find it.
In order to understand how to be rich the study of the rich is necessary.  I believe that the rich, that money, is a thought different than what people think.  Rich/money/wealth is the manifestation of thoughts, following through.  Motivation, opportunity, foresight.  Money is not what we think, our minds are something greater than we can fully understand and I think possibly that money is the manifestation of our mental energy in the tangible world.  A stronger control over our minds.  Therefore a better control over our minds.
This is a terrific book to get a grip on one's finances.  My goals are more ambitious than the basic investing of this book but several of the techniques in this book have helped me.  And I believe that we all need to understand money far more than we are taught to by schools and our parents.  This book is a terrific primer for financial vision.
Ok, first off in person, Diane is hilarious.  She is literally red-cheeked overjoyed to be both rich and sharing her information.  I took tax courses after my first full year of work when I got my paycheck and saw the amount of taxes taken (maliciously) out of it.  This evolved into my business structures and managing my taxes, streaming the tax deductions through my Sole Proprietorship and eventually move into C Corps and S Corps.  <BR>Diane's advice on structure and tax consequences and insight/foresight to business owners is invaluable.  The book is also written is a clear concise way to help the reader navigate through what could become complicated if you didn't have foresight into taxes.
People must learn that rich isn't about money, it's about the thoughtform one learns and the ability to network with people and develop one's thoughts.  Money isn't the end all but I think that the development of the consciousness, the creativity of businesses is essential to the development of our culture, our world as a whole.  Don't misunderstand me, I don't think that a purely capitalistic strategy is perfection but I do think that the availibility of it will allow minds to develop, to formulate new concepts.
Marcus had potential as a arch-enemy but he was given such short shrift here that when he's subsequently killed it doesn't hold the impact one might expect.  Again the big whoopdedoo is Anita being raped.  Which keeps as a recurring theme throughout all of the books.  It tends to wear thin after awhile.<BR>As with my other thoughts on the Anita Blake series some are better than others but only marginally.  I keep hope alive for this series, for this character but each book is a hit or far miss.
It is hard to quantify and get accurate material about what is essentially a secret religion.  It has maintained it's strength through secrecy and privacy.  This book is a basic level, not an advanced level or something that would be perfection to learning.  I would reccommend several books, at least a dozen to get a clear framework.
I bought this book several years ago and was deeply impressed by the creativity of the idea as well as the depth of the interviews.  People truly open up and reveal hilarious, startling and scandalous feelings and motives about their sexual escapades.  What makes these oral histories even more intriguing, much like Studs Terkel, is the fact that a basic outline of the person is given and at some point you come away with the impression that this could be anyone from anywhere.  Which makes gazing across a large group of people in public, all the more interesting!<BR>A great buy!
Just got it in the mail and I find it to be very informative and accurate to the chart information and placement.  I'm really impressed by a book that is nearly 20 years ago and potentially so esoteric being so cogent and chuck full of useful information.  I highly recommend this book for anyone interested in deeper interpretation of their chart through the placement of their houses.  If you don't know the various house placement than you shoudl try a free service like Astrodienst.
This book is mistitled, it should be Days of Our Slaves because Dessa and the slave have no choice but to give into their istresses sexual and emotional demands.  An inequality of power through one human being actually being the possession of another cannot broker to a \\"love story\\".  Though touched on as an issue.  Thsi book decides to take the cheating/easy way out and equate this power imbalance to \\"love\\".  Deplorable.  I studied/worked on this book in a high level college class that related Slave Narratives and Sadomasochism.  This book does play around that area, as does the Black Book by Mapplethorpe and Langston Hughes travel books.  THe Slaves Narratives/Incidents in teh Life of a Slave Girl is a stronger book though I have issues with that as well.<BR>Don't get me wrong I appreciate the strength fo the writing AS writing.  However I have studied and taught African American literature so I have a keen understanding as to the problems, one of which is that if it is African American pablum is tllerable within the genre now.  The freedom of mass publication and right to produce literature has been reduced to normalized American pablum.  Therefore this kind of literature has availed itself to the destructive consequences, which is thorough criticism and dissection.
This is a good book from two points:<BR>One, it explains indepth teh business strategy behind Harpo Studios and those who helped Oprah not only attain her vision but expand it.<BR>Two, the earliest chapters have good information that she has publicly revealed herself about her beginnings in both life and business.<BR>Other than that, I think it's sleazy to write these kinds of books without someone's at the least tacit cooperation.  Though this doesn't approach some of the sniping of say a Tamborelli book, there are still visble comments that one could attribute to a jealous/envious/salacious writer....
This is one of the best books ever on African American language.  And yes, it is a language.  The French experiemntal writer Raymond Federman challenged me to write a piece that would be densely and mentally impregnable to anyone but African Americans as American and English Colonies can be to other races.  It succeeded on many levels.  One, it was a fantastic story and two, it got me to use this book as source for finding new words/terms and as a reference to checking what I already knew.<BR>Thsi book is invaluable to the scholar of language.  I spent the last 2 years patiently hunting for this book as it is out of publication.  I actually bought it at twice the cover price because it is that good.  There is no higher that I can recommend this book.  As the tapestry of language is art, this would be one of Picasso's treasured brushes.
You can get lost in the fact that this is a collection of quotes by Oprah and not thoughts written by Oprah exclusively for this book.<BR>Or you could be smart and glean wisdom from what she has to say.<BR>How she grew up, what she learned from her errors, what she thinks of money and herself in relationship to it, the mental preparation to receive the abundance that she has and how she stays centered.<br />What I think thsi book is valuable for is insight, and perhaps personal inspiration for how to manage one's self in certain situations.  The goal is not to become Oprah, it is to become the best YOU possible.<br />You take or you leave it, but you integrate it into the lessons and challenges of your own life.  The same with John D. Rockefeller, Bill Gates, Jenny Jones (hahhahahaha----kidding).
I believe that books of thsi nature are to show and elucidate hwo certain kinds of peopel think and act.  I think that the consumer shoudl remember that most of these books are gleaned and compiled from interviews, articles and TV quotes not the person directly.  Which means that things can be taken out of context or contrary events can be exampled to a person's time static comment.<BR>All the same, this book is pretty good for insight in Oprah and her thoughts on some issues as well as maturely seeing how her opinion has grown/matured over the years.<BR>A good subject makes a good book but this isn't the indepth exploration of Oprah that one may hope.  Perhaps in some ways she can't truly be seen in any other context as she has a show where she talks about herself and her experiences.  Only a book absolutely written by her could ever truly reveal her.  Someone truly interested in her thoughts will have to wait for that day.
Neil Gaiman is someone who I read as a novelist, I've yet to go for his comic work, though I read illustrated work, so it's not unusual for me to pick up this book.  Shadopw, the protagonist of this book is many things-----first we suspect that he is the mbodiment of a God as a lot of the main characters in this book are.  If he is the son of Odin, then is he Thor?<br />Or is he just a man sired by a God and brought to the brink of reality as one form of God fights others?<br />A variety of Gods make appearances here as a form of Armageddon approaches.  I wish I could say that this novel had a strong central point but it spins around this coming war and how to avert it with Shadow's dead wife walking around.  Shadow eventually sacrifices himself as a vigil to Odin-----all of this occuring with the 20th century.<br />What works in this novel?<br />The origin/genesis of the gods on American soil and their human incarnations and how Shadow sees glimpses of their power.<br />What doesn't work?<br />At the end of this novel you realize Gaiman has done a lot of setting up, a lot of creation of mythos into his own multi-Godded world but to what end?<br />Gods are everywhere, everyone, which is a terrific concept, strong and I believe to some degree the truth of existence, but the war/commentary on God in America is rather empty by the end.  The book goes nowhere.  Yes, Shadow finds the light within, finds purpose, reason to be but we never think that the world is in any danger.  Perhaps this is because teh opposing Gods are technology, TV, the Internet.  This book should've been expanded, travelled more.  Perhaps a trilogy, there's a lot to be mined here, relationships to be explored.  But in one book it feels like a prelude and smacks of being cut short too quickly.
I'm now three books into this four book set and this set is a little disappointing so far.  What made DS9 so special from the other shows is the level, the attitude.  The original were adventurers, the Next Generation explorers/diplomats, Voyager, lost and DS9---dangerous.  Unstable.  Only small piece of the cast was about being Starfleet officers, about rules, regulations.  Now the crew has been homogenized.  Kira is constantly stuck in her office struggling over being Attainted by the Bajoran religion and the others galavant off to the Gamma Quadrant for something to do.  <BR>Vaughn and Tenmei struggle through their silent drama as we wonder what drove them apart, her mother's death (which is never adequately answered), to a reconciliation which makes sense in thsi book and the next but as they are created characters for teh novel series, there's less of a connection to them that the others.<BR>Shar and the Andorian quartet marriage situation is interesting for 1 book but is dragged out for 3 culminating in a madness that is deadly and one of the few impacting emotional scenes along the way.  Though a real break from the norm would've been Shar having this multiple sexualitya nd having an interest in a crew member.  However he's identified himself as male so often in Starfleet that that is how he acts.  Which kind of smacks in the face of a Federation that accepts all kinds of beings.  <BR>Unfortunately there is the thought to compare this to the old DS9 crew because this crew is so bland.  There's no war, no tension, no resolution to the Sisko father and son mystery.  Instead the story picks up on the Bajoran application to the Federation and the Cardassian's in need of help from the ones they once oppressed.<BR>There is the constant parallel here between the Nazis and the Jews and unfortunately the destruction that the Cardassians reaped upon Bajor shouldn't be forgiven, it's almost too easy.  The book simulates tension rather than truly creating it.  My hope was that this was simply the beginning of a worthy series of books but teh fact that it's several writers doing this and not one controlling the whole story makes the takes and dimensions resonate false.<BR>Thne story can end only one of two ways with Bajor becoming part of the Federation and Ro and Quark and others no longer having purpose on DS9 on yet another hold up to the integration of the world into the UFP.<BR>Such a politicized concept for an action/thinking crew that DS9 once had is a little too patly handled here.  Bluntly, there's very little actions lotttttttttttttsssssssssssss of feelings and dialogue and practically very obvious dialogue.<BR>And so on to Book Two............
This book is better than its opening book but not entirely strong yet.  There's action and contact with aliens that brings resolution to the Vaughn/Tenmei tension but still we're waiting for something to happen, something bigger than the dry belabored political issues that spin on and on and on.<BR>I think that these books are to be some sort of special form for the DS9 series, a block of books a year?<BR>Kira spends a lot of time walking around frustrated, angry, having really nothing to do but be a symbol of strength.<BR>Ummmmmm, aren't their any renegade.......pick a species!<BR>The Vahni are boring as the Defiant and crew warp through the Gamma Quadrant.  What about a renegade changeling?  Some kind of diabolical plot throughout the Gamma sector the Defiant would be involved in.  But everything is so.....bland, safe, sanitary, Next generation.......you know wiritng this I'm a little upset.....I was originally gonna make it 3 stars but no, no, no it deserves only two!<BR>Onto Book Three!
We can give Ms. Rice's sister credit for two things.  A book deal and the ability to string together sentences, plot and development to a conclusive end.  What exactly those sentences are about, what the plot of this book was or what its developing into.....well.....shhhhh!  Only Alice knows.  And she's keeping it a tight secret.  It would be nice to be let in on it because there are so many things going on in this book that there was the possibility for a good story.<BR>Does she have an editor?  Someone to create a cohesive thought from this?  The book has about 15 major characters who talk and talk and talk about a war, loyalty to a King and at various points are either werewolves or marauding spirits.  I often accuse books of being simplistic in their writing style therefore dumbing down the content of the plot but in truth this book suffers from the opposite.  A writer who is capable with words but not plot and characters.  The whole fantasy/gothic market seems to be hot and a werewolf trilogy seems logical---which is probably what Anne said to Alice one day.  God save us from nepotism!<BR>However there should at the very least be structure and control to writing.  This lacks that and therefore meanders and weaves and delves without exploring or truly opening up anything.  I found it difficult to read in just form.  Can't recommend it.  Thank God it was from the library and not a purchase, then this review would've been truly upset.
The 365 lessons will take you longer than 1 year.  I'm on 320 something after close to 9 years of study.  It seems simplistic at first but to re-orient your mind to the lesson changes your perception of reality.<br />Then there are the teachings for Teachers.  No healing need be repeated because faith says no matter what the physical senses show the healing has taken place, outside of your perception of time or matter changes.<br />Time, Space, the Body and Death----the only things all of our thoughts come down to.  And the Course asserts that they do not exist.<br />We are alive, thought, energy and ultimately love centered.<br />It is easy to dismiss Schuuchman's channeling of teh COurse until you've had the subconscious/voice of God hit you not with what you or your preconceived religion would expect you tot hear and perceive but somethign totally new.<br />Clarity.  The Course is so dense that it is clairty.<br />It will take a long time to digest, to disseminate, to assimilate as you must live the Courses teachings.<br />There is Christ/Jesus terminology.  And I recommend that it be ignored.  A mature reader can put in whatever they need to to symbolize that portion of the universe.<br />God is more than a \\"being\\"----as God must be.  The Course does no advertisement in anyway and all of the proceeds go to publish more Course books.  I have a feeling that the Course is something bigger than we can see now.  I will tell you the truth when I say that it took me a year to get a hold of this book.  There's something about this book that isn't quite tied to the normal spiritual book route.<br />A lesson, a week, a month.  However.  The Course is worth it.
Marianne Williamson has for years been a source of comfort I've been able to reflect upon over the years.  I got all of the audio cassettes of her speeches and A Course In Miracles and the tapes of that.  I remember exactly how I came upon this book---Oprah was interviewing Ivana Trump and Ivana said something about her pain and turmoil over the divorce from The Donald, Oprah recommended it to her and I took my last $20 until payday and went out and got this book.<BR>It changed my life because it agreed with my own thoughts about the universe.  Not because it was so revolutionary but because I had thought these thoughts before and thats what lead me to the Course.  <BR>Neither this book nor the Course is ultimately easy to digest.  You must change your mind.  About Time, Space, the Body and Death existing and all of the precepts we place upon that thoughtform.  What I like about ARTL is that it opens this whole thought in a way that is accessible to someone before you tackle the Course.  The Course is such an intense book, the spiritual lessons so different from normal spiritual lessons that there does need to be a primer of sorts and entrance into it.  Are there others?  Wapnick, Gawain, yes.  But Marianne gives you the feeling that she's sat on the same barstool you have, dated the same jerk you did, endured the dysfunctional parents you did.<BR>And if you listen to the tapes of her live, she'll admit that yes, she has all of the above and more!  Marianne is a hoot and a half and at the same time she GETS IT!  There's a separation on the Earth of folks who get it and those who don't.  Is that enlightenment?  Of Perception?  Yes, I think it is a step in teh right direction.  There are a dozen high book sinbetween and perhaps the true lesson is that if you truly get one of them you don't need a dozen.<BR>The thought of God as balance, as love, as energy accessible to us all as a choice, as a thought manifestation.  This book is one of the cars on a whole new train of thought, ACIM is the engine.  ALL ABOARD!
It would be easy to dissect the plot of this timeless classic, to go into teh writers prison time and gambling habits and addcition to excess and misery.  That would be simple.  Instead I will talk about the craft of writing itself.  This book excels not so much based upon form in the plot structure.  The story is simple and even when examined rather sad and simplistic.  Instead it is the craft of writing.  Nearly 500 pages of true poetic writing.  Writing that sustains even as to some points it bores.  By bores I mean in length and depth of personal introspection.  Through American fiction we are used to action, action, action, dialogue explaining what the action was.  In Russian literature there is a focus on history in relationship to the main characters and their circumstances.  Russian literature is concerned with the political forces that shape lives, in America we are concerned with how fame shapes the body politic.  Take Dreiser's Sister Carrie as an example of the desire for fame at the cost of morals in comparison to the theft of money for survival, from a despicable person.<BR>What I often do with &quot;heavy&quot; books like this is I get the Cliffnotes to accompany the book as I read it, to in a sense have both a discussion internally and a map so that I don't miss any of the rich fields along the way.  That is how the classics should be taught, with an eye to the brains that have yet to be initiated into such heavy patience reading.
The above is a quote by Flaubert when asked how he conceptualized a woman so well.  With such classic, I often wonder how to review them, a thousand minds, finer and baser than mine have written and spoken on them so I can only speak as a writer to what touches me.<br />The form of finding a unisexual voice as a writer.  My work was often praised for its' ability to transverse, transcend, or transform with simple intonation from male to female to female to male.  I had yet to find many writers who I felt did so without a denegrating tone to the feminine or an absurdist to the masculine but when recommended Flaubert by Prof. Raymond Federman, a writer of esteem of experiemental literature, I had to jump in, no?  Flaubert achieves the balance, the intonation of harmonious tones that make Bovary live.  Her fall from grace, her collapse to infidelity out of spite, loneliness, boredom, isolation, sexual awakening is fraught with the peril of public scorn.  Adultery these days is TV fodder, so commonplace that I wonder in mature relationships if one actually expects it.  But Flaubert wisely chose to question it from the point of the guilty in a world where guilt was tantamont to self-destruction.<br />Bovary breathes as if written by a woman, though I feel such a statement is what undermines literature.  Bovary breathes because she was written by a writer not obsessed with his gender or sexuality of even the societal mores that he was challenging.  Again Flaubert should be read with a guide if a classroom setting is not available but it shouldnt be abandoned because of age or nationality.  There is a sense that the romanticism attached to the conventional French image is being challenged here by burgeoning feminine sexuality.  And at the same time I admire Flaubert for being a WRITER and not a gender in his craft.
This was the first book I read by Poppy and while I wa simpressed with the angst the whole twinks having sex and their tight, sinuous, slightly androgynous forms wore on after awhile.  I think that there's a pandering going on.  A pandering of sexuality by women of a certain ilk who think this is merely all there is to it.  These effete, creative, deeply tortured pretty boys.  It actually makes me wonder if the women who write like this have been virulently attacked by teh thoughtforms of such work as Cosmopolitan because it is a direct transfer of such thinking.  If you're tired of hearing about waif-esque qomen who are tortured and live lives where love is something they dimly consider inbetween being beautiful and blessed, then this book rocks for you.  It also comes off as more pedophiliac soft porn than erotica.  I imagine a guy in his late thirties or forties buying these books and getting the latest copy of Britney Spears videos and LIE, the DVD to really sugar his jellybeans.<br />Writing was atmospheric, the plot though---destroyed by the constant necessity to deride itself into kudzu, kudzu, kudzu, which ultimately is pablum.  Again I believe she has potential, when she stops writing tripe and goes for a literature over this gothic--going nowhere foolishness, she may explode as a writer of value.  I see why she credits drinking to her writing and how sobriety may mean a dry spell.  A look at some of this work as a whole sober could stop a writer writing for awhile.
Here's the problem with some classics.  In order for everyone else to assume them as classics the thoughtform is that the reader wants to be or is a young White male.  I am not any of those so to me Holden spent a lot of time whining.  The fact that it also shows up as the book on most nutcases bookcases says a lot about this book.  <BR>Do I think it speaks to some who need attention and feel left out of the world?  Sure.  but so does barney if you pay close attention.  My stars are for a good first person narrative and its durability over 50 years...<BR>Though I do hate writer psychoanalyzation because the very point of fiction is that it is suppose to be made up and not projection.  Therefore I consider this good fiction, but not outstanding literature and I will leave the biographical, however salacious, notes on Salingers private peccadilloes for girls that resembled boys and their resemblance to Holden Caulfield up to higher, greater minds than my own.
I always need a good professional book to use as reference in my work and this one is excellent.  I was impressed with easy to manage chapters and the concise way in which it explained contracts and so forth.  There are a bevy of examples of the work so that for whatever kind fo situation one may find one's self there is help.<br />I do paralegal work with an eye towards law school and I also own a small business so books that I purchase for professional reasons must be flexible and strong enough to serve multiple purposes with me, this one does.<br />I was also lucky enough to get it at (less than) the original textbook price.  I do purchase things at the full Amazon price but I have found teh used service an excellent resource for obtaining high end merchandise at a great discount.
This go around Jean-Claude is being challenged by a centuries, perhaps millenium old vampire.  Ok, this is where Ms. Hamilton has her biggest problem.  Could a toddler kick an adults [rear]?  I think not.  Ms. Hamilton unfortunately uses action movie cliches----the villain must die for the battle to be won.  She's losing the profit of a Rogue's Gallery that represernt a serious threat to Anita, Jean-Claude, Richard and their assorted friends and minions.  If someone shows up in an Anita Blake book as a villain, you know a few things.  They die, she probably shoots them and they aren't ever on the line of a true villain.  I mean the line of morality.  Though Anita often worries about morality and spiritually, her world is too black and white.  Win or lose.  Good and evil.  <br />What these books need is a reason to keep going back, threats lurking around corners, and possibilities that in a new world where such mythology and lore is commonplace, the old morals don't mean as much.  Anita attacks her personal decisions which put her between a sociopath and a prude, which don't mesh but rarely are we given a perspective on this world that is being created.  There is constant mention of a Federal Act to  announce vampires as \\"real\\" and give them full rights.  But if they're walking and talking are they truly dead?  There seems to be the underlying push of fundamentalism religion challenging the vampires and Anita but it's an argument that doesn't hold water.  In order for it to do so, there should be more intimate knowledge of a world perspective on this.  Who's president in Anita's world?  What does the government think of all of these superhumans running around.  Ms. Hamilton foreshadows often but doesn't deliver real answers on this partially because of my stated problem with Anita Blake novels.  The first person POV.  This kind of widespread mayhem needs to be shown popping up on plenty of radar screens in teh media, government and so on in this world.  <br />The story shows all of these people but rarely does it show how they're actions ripple outside of Anita's sphere.  At the end of this novel, it becomes a comic super team fight between Anita's folks and the villains.  I'm not saying they can't win, I'm simply saying that if someone has been alive thousands of years and has powers untold from being a vampire, would a bullet really do anything to him, a stake of wood.  Unfortunately none of these long lived people are imbued with wisdom which is what so many years would bring.  And their motives are so out of line with someone of advanced years that it makes you wonder, the throwing around of teh age of a vampire, does it mean anything.  It's suppose to be impressive but if a twentysomething Anita can kill them so easily are they really all that tough?<br />I would like to see Anita and pals measured against others yes, but the others, villains or whatever have to be taken as seriously as the protagonists for their danger to mean anything.<br />This book is good as another brick in the wall, but its one fo the weaker bricks.
Unfortunately this book is racist, classist and displays religious bigotry.  The villain is a \\"voodoo queen\\" who raises zombies and Anita's personal religious bent casts Dominga Salvador and her African originated religious beliefs as immediately suspect and evil.  It was irresponsible to write this without a display of the good side of Santeria, Candomble, Macumba, worship of Ocha or the Orisha or the Saints. <br />The plot was stronger than other books in series because it wsn't laden with as many characters as the rest of teh books became so that focus stayed on the crime plot.  Which was good, remarkable even for a Hamilton book in many ways.  Anita never so much of solves a crime as she just shoots the right folks at the right time.  This book actually has a thread of strength to it but the racism and one-sided views of God through Catholicism weakens it.  I'm reading it thinking to myself Anita raise steh dead, sleeps with a werewolf and a vampire and is JUDGING someone.  Laughable.  If this books were a little stronger, it could attain the level of dreck.
Anita has a contract on her head.  Makes sense, she's upset a lot of people.  So she has to go underground with all of her friends to stay alive while hunting for the killer.  A much, much stronger plot from Hamilton with a nice villain twist that literally comes out of nowhere.  Nice touch.  But Grabriel and Raina, villains who are realy whacked and interesting had more than one book in their madness.  Unfortunately Hamilton kills her best villans off far too quickly and unbelievably by Anita.  She shoots them or stabs them.  Don't get me wrong, Anita routinely gets beaten like no one's business and injured beyond reason but again we have the rape threat.  Don't these people with all of these powers have anything better in mind to torture someone?<br />The contract killer thing breaks down as it turns out to be a plot involving her boyfriend Richard and his wolf pack.  So Anita is actually able to go on the offensive far too easily.  I often wonder if Anita is really all that without her guns and knives.  We never see her outwit anyone.  Everyone just bumbles around until they get shot or stabbed.  Anita uses a warped psychology on Gabriel the insane leopard that wants to rape her and she still rescues Richard and Jean-Claude in time.  <br />I like Anita, I really do.  I think the series has strength but there are flaws in execution of the writing.  Hamilton can write a book and even convey characters well but the plot and motivation tend to be thin.  Most villains want to kill Anita because well.....they want to kill her.  Anita has no Moriarty mainly because Anita lacks the intellectual capacity to attarct SMART villains.  Anita has gotten more powerful with the shared vampire/werewolf marks linking her to Richard and Jean-Claude, she's gotten more violent and vicious because wel, her life demands it. <br />But she hasn't gotten smarter.  Therefore her challenges haven't either.  Maybe Hamilton needs to construct a plot before layering all of the soap opera drama.  I would love to read a 700 page novel if it took her that long to explore what each book could explore.  Anita often suffers from a TV, get to the next act, show the villain, rush, rush, rush because the viewer will get bored mentality.  I've often noticed that it takes about 100-125 pages for Anita to get to the point of the plot of the book---the crime scene, a clue, whatever because there is so much other \\"stuff\\" going on.  Success often makes writers harder to edit because they've proven that they have the formula down, right?  No, a real writer is challenging the work, the content in new ways each time out the pen.<br />Perhaps Hamilton and Anita need to get a little smarter in plotting and unravelling a mystery rather than just catering to what ultimately makes the book an order of fast food rather than a delicious meal.
The basic premise is interesting.  The intricacy of the insurance world is explained quite well and John's life is boring.  However the problem comes in the third act when Max, John and the new girl with many names are trapped in a town that is evil.  Nice twist, an almost unexpected road leading to this final showdown.  But here;s the problem Ellen Snyder (assistant manager at the Pasadena branch office of McLaren Life and Casualty, pays out a 12 million dollar death benefit to an imposter and then disappears, company red flags go up all over)a pivotal character dead before any other characters get to interact with her.  John only reflects on his brief affair.  I felt a little cheated when her body is found, quite impossibly, in a field.  She's instrumental to the case yes but also to the who tableau of the crime and hence the book.  The replacement girl is suppose to be this genius interesting thing but she comes in as a pale substitute.<BR>Security consultant, Max Stillman, is called in to clean up the mess. Grabbing data analyst, John Walker, from McLaren's San Francisco headquarters to assist him, because he knew Ellen intimately, the two set off across the country, tracking Ellen and the money. Stillman's convinced she's guilty of insurance fraud. Walker is sure she's innocent and sticks with Stillman and the case to protect and defend her. But what these two find, at the end of the road, shocks and surprises even Max Stillman, and he's seen it all.  However at a certain point the obvious becomes apparent and the three of them trapped in this town that kills for cash is played well but never pays off.<BR>What hurts the book is that we're total outsiders to this town and its residents so they're all violent zombies attacking the heroes.  There is no connection to the villains, they're just a mass facelss mob.  If Ellen had been one of them then we could see some motivation see some betrayal, some game played.  I love Thomas Perry's work but no one is close to getting into the scrapes that Jane Whitefield does and gets out of.  <BR>Max Stillman is good, not a Jane but good.  John just gets to be a newbie and the chickie who loves computers is just there as a sex convenience and DC-esque Oracle.  <br />A nice ride but don't expect the bells and whistles and porterhous you get with 4 out of 5 of teh Jane Whitefield books.  This is a departure when instead there should have been some kind of combo action.  Jane trying to hide Ellen as Max.John and towns[people close in all for different reasons.  Now that wou;d've been interesting.<br />A page turner?  Ehhhh, a finisher.  You're 100 pages in, might as well finish it.
In order to exapand my skill set I needed a book that gave me an overview of multiple areas of paralegal work.  Sometimes I would get called for something they would say do you do estates wills and trusts or corporate derivatives? And while my experience may've lent to it, unless you've done something for years and years its hard to jump right into a conversation about it.  Not so with this book at your fingertips.  Gives you excellent outline of an assortment of areas.<BR>Am I advocating getting this book and diving in?  Yes, whatever your field you should have another field that you're actively involved in learning and creating as a branch from your main interest.  I started in graphic design, did so many presentations that I got into finance and worked on so much legal stuff that I got into taxation and legal work.  It is my plan to go onto law school just for the pure learning but with books like this and a solid commitment to learning you can get someone, a firm an attorney to sponsor you and go take the Bar.  yes, it's that good.<br />My only wish is that I had ordered it from here but I needed it quick, fast and in a hurry so I bought it from a store.
...  I now give [this] as a gift to anyone and everyone who whines about dating!   <BR>I quote Dr. Allen, I love Dr. Allen.  ...<BR>Not only is this book good for dating, its good for understanding people period.  Who is masculine energy and how to spot them and who is feminine energy and why.  Once you explain this simple insight to people they nod and identify everyone around them!<br />The book has a great quiz to help you identify yourself and then so many outlines of who and what you are and how to find someone to compliment that.  People often say but I don't want to give up being me to meet someone.  And yet we do it all the times to fit into the right job.  Its not so much of giving up yourself as packaging yourself honestly as to who you are and what you truly want.<br />It really also helps you think and focus on what is important to you in a relationship.  From living arrangements to sex this book covers it all and it breaks it down in chunks you can understand.  It also covers the honeymoon phase and the imperfect phase and how to know where your relationship is headed.  And most importantly HOW to argue.  The wonderful thing about the structure is that its balanced.  You never feel like you're getting only half the picture and if you're really smart you can simply start reading the book as energy and not apply gender to the pronoun usage.<br />I also think it gives incredible insights to communication period, its one of the first ways I use to get a feel for a person and learn how to communicate with them.  Dr. Allen teaches you an invalubale, life long tool so quickly and simply in what to listen for that you will literally run thru your life calling out who was which energy.<br />Can you guess which energy I am from this review?<br />I recommend this book avidly and wholeheartedly as a gift to self and others and the used price is so right to give it as ... gift!
I've read comics for years and then I stopped because of quite honestly Chris Claremont leaving the XMen.  Pretty art never turned me on, interesting stories did.  So I was feeling adventurous one day and I saw these trade paperbacks.  Reasonable price, nice art so I jumped in.<BR>Very, very good.  This is very XMen with an R rating.<BR>Kaizen's death at the end, hilarious.  <BR>\\"I only wanted to have some fun.\\"<BR>I agree with other reviewers that the reader got no fill in for who the heck everyone was.  Jenny Sparks comes off as the strongest character but then she dies so I guess she kinda had too, huh?  I think that the book suffers from a lack of depth in some ways.  Depth not in story but in characterization.  You have plot, characters and storyline.  Plot and storyline are strong but I didn't get why they were all so dedicated and upset at the same time.  Perhaps my problem is that I read normal books so I can see the de-evolution of the dumbing down of comics.<BR>Don't get me wrong I bought teh next book the following day and started collecting subsequent issues but I did feel after awhile that I was watching mysteries do things.  There's got to be a balance between comics saying something and good action, yes?<BR>This whole big screen movie thing is for dunderheads who watch every big screen movie to come out, who wait in line for Spidey Man or Star Wars, FOR HOURS.  Who watch TV.  Well, I don't do those things but I enjoy a good story, a little fantasy every once in awhile and Authority gave me a nice jolt.  <BR>What I liked about the trade paperback route was that it gave me a solid chunk of issues, a full arc of storylines.  Wouldn't it be nice if for the outrageous prices that are ultimately for coloring and \\"star artists\\" we actually got a book this size monthly?  If writers had 200 pages to work out that months story I think the quality would improve.  Not its down to what 18 pages and 14 pages of the latest bubblegum ads,PLaystation games and movie coming attractions?<BR>So I like Authority but I do see a weakening of the idea without good characters backing it up.  4 stars for strength of plot and storyline being a bit more randy and raunchy and risque than normal.
They fight God.<br />Ok, that caught my eye.  I mean really, really caught my eye and then Jenny croaks as the 20th Century ends.<BR>Deep thoughts for a comic, no?<br />I also noticed a huge JLA book where they fight God too and then in their regular series they fight Armageddon.<br />Ok, what often interests me is the mass thought form, what pople are creating and projecting outwards.<br />They fight God.  They destroy God.  They win.<br />The cost of destroying God is Jenny, the 20th century dies, though she is reborn as a new babe with Quantum powers----her powers reflect the century she inhabits.  Electricity for 20th, quantum for 21st, which is creative yes.<br />Did I mention they fight God?<br />Ok, you've got the pseudo Batman and Superman guys as gay lovers which is cheeky but not well developed as simply a couple.  I often watch the mass media wrangle with how to interpret sexuality, race, religion and so on in a populist fashion that doesn't include stereotypes and the goal is generally banality.  Like dealing with a blind date with an obese person----you're not like your ad, yet at the same time, its a real person in there.<br />They kill God.<BR>Ok, I'm not sure what to make of that battle.  Isolated as one fight, its unique, interesting but it popped up a few times in what I could glean from the surface of comicdom and it worried me.  What interests me are the ramifications of killing God.  What everyone thinks about it, what it means.  These heroes are cold, yes but there has to be a heart in them somewhere.  Its too----divorced from itself to be anything but popular.<br />I do like The Authority but I think it needs another layer of subversion.  Of thought that accounts for something besides just being a comic that comes across like a movie.  Haven't we all seen enough movies?<br />The characterization is much stronger in this book but thats mainly because they have Jenny's death to react to.  The Authority suffers from Julia Roberts--itis.  Ok, she's a huge star and everyone loves her but are her movies REALLY quality?  Or just packaged well?  Sold properly?  She sparkles?  Thats how the Authorty comes off, they got the marketing mix just perfect to make us all kinda like it even though its still sacchrine.<br />Did I mention they killed God?<br />Oh yeah, Julia will never take the creative risks of say a Sandra Bullock.  Or a Meg Ryan.  See my point?
Elektra Lives Again<br />The story of Daredevil and Elektra is literally a stand-out Romeo and Juliet of the comic world.  Frank Miller created the perfect fallen hero in Elektra, shaped her psychological complex to suit her name and tied her to Daredevil aka blind lawyer Matt Murdock, the epitome of the blind lover and moral code.  There is now a current monthly comic book for Elektra, the point of her death muddied by Marvel's desire to capitalize and it falls flat.  <BR>One cannot remix Bach.<br />The Elektra back story is simple:<br />Part One: Elektra became a ninja assassin for the evil Hand after the death of her father.  She betrayed the Hand after learning their skills/secrets then going solo.  The Hand came after her and eventually the assassin Bullseye fatally wounded her and she died in Daredevil's arms.<br />Part Two: The Hand decided to resurrect Elektra and make her an undead slave/assassin.  Daredevil interceded and through sheer force of will, purged her soul of the evil spell right before she came back to life.  However she disappeared right after her heard a single heartbeat.  He was left with the doubt of whether or not she lived.<br />Part Three: Elektra joins with a rogue gov't agent in Elektra Assassin to stop essentially a demon/anti-Christ from becoming the President of the USA.  In print, she succeeded, some argue that in reality we need her even more than fantasy allows.<br />Elektra Lives Again.<BR> The Hand---persistent to a fault are at the resurrection game again.  Anyone.  An assassin Kirigi, Bullseye, Elektra---the Hand have this fanatical need to have a Prime A Leader Assassin.  Low self esteem in ninja cult, I suppose.  This time they want to first kill Bullseye (who is in prison for killing scads of folk---he's kind of like Hannibal Lecter with the ability to turn anything into a weapon-anything, we're talking orange seeds here and use him to kill.  To ... Elektra, ... Matt, ... anyone.  Elektra alive and avoiding the love of herlife Matt Murdock is hot on the Hand's trail to stop all of this madness.<BR>Matt begins having psychic dreams about Elektra and what her soul is going through because of the link resurrecting her has created between them.  <BR>What makes this interesting is that though Matt uses his fighting skills, his heightened senses and amazing acrobatics, he never dons the Daredevil costume.  That's the first mark of this work being superb.<BR>The second mark is the silence of Elektra and her ability to move through the real world as a shadow, a dead woman, a ninja, a ruthless assassin committed to doing what's right no matter the fall-out.<br />Frank Miller's point in all of this carnage and Elektra dying one more time is that this is their destiny.  Elektra must deal with these dark assassins and have Matt as a tugboat of light to keep her near the line of goodness.  When Matt cradles Elektra, killed by a dead Bullseye he finally can accept her death---the fact that she's dressed all in white as a nun is wonderful imagery.<br />The art of Lynn Varney is tired.  I mean that as a compliment.  Everyone looks haggard, worn out, tired.  And that's how they should look.  These people are something slightly different from the normal superheroes/villains in the sense that it's all personal with them and they willingly ... and will die (sometimes several times) for the Good Fight.  The battles are intensely personal and gory, violent to the degree of shocking but that's what a real fight should look like.  And when you get right down to it, these are some mentally unbalanced folk.  Even Matt.  And they should be.  That's what I mean by personal, this comes as close as possible to almost reality.  Of all the superhero films out there, this should be made into a film.  Not necessarily a trilogy but maybe one or two that really convey the horror and pity and sadness of this whole beautiful, bloody, twisted tale.<br />Five Stars.
The Eight<br />This book was recommended to me by a co-worker and when I heard the build up about it, I thought I was really in for a treat.  Don&#8217;t get me wrong, it is a passably good book.  However the major strength of this book is it&#8217;s flashbacks to the French Revolution/The Terror, the incorporation of Robespierre, Marat, Catherine Corday, Catherine the Great, Charlemagne and so on.  The parts that take place in the 1970&#8217;s are rather pedantic and the surprise ending as all of the pieces of the Montglane Service are gathered (or as many as possible) is interesting but again only because it harks back to the two hundred year old past.  <BR>Immortality, psychic children, the fall of Napoleon and so on (so much of European history is incorporated) does make the past itself come alive, dashing, full of life and danger.  But it falls off in the present.  The heroine simply isn&#8217;t compelling as her 200 past counterpart.  This sharp contrast between two women, centuries apart, until the end, with a common goal and common enemies, weakens one and strengthens the other.<br />In a nutshell, The Montglane Service (an ornate chess board and pieces) owned by Charlemagne is reputed to possess supernatural powers.  In order to protect the world, the board and pieces are hidden in a convent and then the pieces are scattered throughout the world by nuns.  Everyone is after the Service and it soon becomes apparent that the Service re-creates people into the positions of chess and pieces.  This is fascinating as we literally read a chess game with characters being created.  However when transported to the present day, it falls apart and becomes hokey.  The weight of history and such compelling people supposedly involved with the Service adds a depth to the past that the froth of the present can&#8217;t match.<br />I thought it would make an interesting film but I wasn&#8217;t sure if the book would have to be made in a linear fashion without constant flashingback or if it were too complex of a tale with too many characters to work visually.<br />So, in sum, my review, like the book itself is split.  It did create an interest in me about The Terror and Catherine the Great and Potemkin and so on.  Which for a piece of fiction was pretty impressive.<br />The book itself becomes a Potemkin and you&#8217;ll have to know your Catherine the Great history to get that reference.<br />Three stars.
I, Che Guevara<br />First off, in order to read this book you have to know who Che was and what he was about.  So I think you should get Che by Jon Anderson, a biography of the revolutionary.  It's what I did and with the marked irony of the covers, it also serves as a primer on the focus of the novel.<br />Then accept whole-heartedly that these are two entirely different books/perspectives/realities.<br />That said.  I, Che is a good novel but if you know anything about Che it slowly degenerates strictly around his character.  The premise is simple: Che ain't dead, there was a switch but Che has decided that his former way isn't working and he starts a socialist movement, eventually getting a democratic election in Cuba going after Fidel steps down.<br />This book is a Washington Establishment wet dream.  Kind of like watching Rambo so that you can feel that you really did win in Vietnam.  It further helps that the chief architect, Che turns against his former ideals and overthrows the country he helped to overthrow.  From that perspective it comes off rather weak.  But from the light of progressing Che as a person who changes his ideology to suit the world rather than demand that the world fit into his former ideology of socialism-Communism, the book works.  But more than anything this book is about the power of the media in elections.  Cuba becomes a petrie dish of socialism versus democracy and a hybrid of the two wins out.  The book at its heart is idealistic on one hand and a blatant sucking up on the other.  Che and Fidel never meet in the book, never have the fateful conversation that we're all waiting for so Che, this new Che remains the figure of glaring spotlight.  The constant shuffling game of whether or not this is the real Che is silly after awhile and though this new Che tries to explain his evasiveness, it never quite goes over.<br />Now in comparison to the real Che.  Merde.  I hope the man is dead because if not Mr. Blackthorn better watch out, this book is a mockery of who and what Che (rightfully or wrongly) stood for.  It goes against his character of rigid discipline and fanatical zeal for changing the world.  It is a clever What if..? but it kind of borders on the taste level of ---\\"What if grandma had become a prostitute instead of marrying grandpa?\\" because in the end there is the taste that the new Che has prostituted himself in a slow, subversive way to the true ideals of the Republic from the writings of Thomas Jefferson.  One of Che's adamant feelings was on slavery, neo or otherwise.  This is an attempt to integrate Che into democracy through a man that Che would've seen as a bourgeois Yanqui.  Che was all for killing the bourgeois Yanquis and there were quite a few public executions after the Cuban revolution where Che ordered or carried out the order to cleanse.<br />Nah, he wouldn't have gone to the other side so easily, so anonymously. <BR>However this book is for an American audience, an audience that won't sit down with a great scholarly, biography in one hand and the fictionalized what if in the other.  That would require shutting off the TV and having a thought or two.  So I, Che finds its' way into bestseller-dom through American ignorance.  Now that, both Che's would agree with.<br />Go get Che by Jon Anderson, a better, more gripping, visceral read.  You won't always like the real Che but you will understand who he was.<BR>Three stars.
Tituba<br />This book, published in the early sixties centers around a slave woman who during the Salem Witch Trials is tried as a witch.  While the book itself is written in a fashion that made me wonder if I were reading something intended for young adults, it does hold water.  The story is reasonably compelling and has enough intricacies of characters and betrayals to engage the reader.  It telegraphs itself from a mile away, yes, that simplicity of form making it a story that doesn&#8217;t demand nor deceive.  <br />Tituba comes across as not so much foolish but as trapped by her circumstances.  She is the property of a family, lead by a reverend of stern character in charge of white children who know that they have power over their adult caretaker.  The mistress of the house spends all of her time sick and therefore powerless so the role of caretaker without authority falls to Tituba.  For a book set during slavery, the subject of personal freedom isn&#8217;t addressed here because that&#8217;s not what this book is about.  It&#8217;s about a further removal of rights and personal power through the witch-hunts.  Tituba, through a series of first seemingly innocent events and then gradually darker, is trapped to becoming a witch on trial.  Only when she is accused of being a witch does it really grind home the trap that slavery has her in.  She cannot flee, she barely has rights to speak up for herself and because of race, is already half-condemned.  It becomes literally her slave workman skills that bring her &#8220;friends&#8221; who will testify on her behalf, give her value over the other women on trial who are merely seen as witches.<br />This book is an easy read, less than a couple of hours, closer to being like a short story in it&#8217;s simplistic form and intent.  The adventure of the read is the twist ending.  Being a slave saves Tituba so that she can return to slavery.  A dark irony that strikes home when one begins comparing what was the greater evil and how one evil can save a person from another by enshrouding them.  Here, slavery is a helper, unfortunately.  Luckily, it is made clear by the force of witch-hunt story that this is not a book about slavery, pro or con.  It is about a woman, a Black woman, who is a slave in a culture that persecutes all of its inhabitants in any way possible for being different or having new ideas.  In the end, this book is about the cruelty of humans, in so many forms---bigotry, misogyny, racism, etc..<br />Four stars
I read this book after I read The Stories of Eva Luna and I'm grateful that I did.  I was able to read teh stories first, to see the creation and not the creator first.  Sort of like not standing backstage at a magic show.  Eva is not quite remarkable as surprising in her life's, notice I don't say her because that takes a while to mature, innate ability to continue.  She bounces around so much in this novel and into so many situations that are both hilarious and heartbreaking.  The whole Riad the Turk story is close to beign the best section.  Unfortunately the whole Eva Luna Storyteller image allows you to see the book as a construction of short stories but also appreciate the natural way that they flow from one to the other.  <BR>I liked that Allende has a writer within her own stories and then has that writer write, it's a nice play on sub-realism.  I would say that Eva does come off better as a heroine that Eliza in Daughter of Fortune and I'm not even touching the ninny in Love &amp; Shadows as a comparison.<BR>Dare I say that there is another Eva Luna book  cloating around out there, a collection of short stories again, a further novel step or perhaps an interaction with another character from another book.  That's what I always get the feeling that Allende is doing, creating all of these threads but not attaching them.  It's like watching a corner from across the street and seeing two really interesting people about to turn the corner and meet but instead somebody turns around and walks away or drops dead or vanishes.<BR>I like Allende for the strength of her writing but I find them all a little Pre-Awesome, if you know what I mean.
What makes this collection stand out so profounding, havign been out for years is not only that it's African_American but that it's good.  It's intelligent.  From poetry to fiction to experiemntal pieces that confront the reader with concepts of race to sex and back again.<BR>This book in no way apologizes nor quite celebrates in a verbose way, it more of seduces and suggests and laughs and tickles and plays with the whole genre of race and sexuality themes and questions. <BR>It takes the question of what particularly ...[African-American]folks find erotic and displays it as Gypsy Rose Lee did, suggesting, throwing out the vulgar as possible, and then going even further and winking and crooking a finger.<BR>You laugh out loud and then shift with a dark smile.<BR>I give it constantly as a gift and spend more time replacing my own copy as it keeps getting pinched.  There is something about African-American sexuality that fascinates like aliens on Mars.  Erotique Noir is strong enough of an anthology to not pander into this racist fetish but instead stare it boldly in the eye and ask whether or not it can handle this story or that poem or this one haiku.<BR>And as an absolute party activity you have to pass around the Sex Signs section and everyone must read theirs aloud.  Can't be too many people, I've found that about 10 tops but somehow it frees people up to really have a ribauld discussion, a Q&A and even a rveelation or two that puts people at ease about things we all want to talk about or have questions about.<BR>A wonderful book.
The strength of this novel lies in the possibility of life after death.  In the last few books that I've read, not by choice but by happenstance I keep running into this theme of immortality.  Of the fear of death.  What makes this novel different is that we get the fear from the perspective of Dawit/David who is immortal and is not afraid of dying but off his family doing so.  After he kills a child who now lies in a nursing home and then must kill his wife's friend a reporter who uncovers a clue about him and then Khladun, creator of the Immortals from the blood of Christ, we see how complicated immortality is.<BR>The concept of changing identities every twenty or thrity years is posisble to imagine.  But there are things that must be sacrificed.  Children, love, even to a degree notoriety because this is what ultimately starts unraveling David's cover, his notoriety in one life is flickering like a flame at the edges of his new one.<BR>Here's what I wonder, do the ties that bind African-American communities, the inter-relationships, ultimately put David at a greater risk?  Being not the majority percentage in America given enough connectability, isn't there the possibility that if not related in blood, most African-American are by story, by some touchstone?<BR>Is immortality particularly dangerous to David because he's passing for Black in a country where someone of his intellect and ability to pick up talents would stand out, much along the lines of &quot;the Talented 10th&quot;?  The book then brings us to another question, what are you willing to die and kill for?  And Ms. Due suggests that the easiest kills are the ties that bind us because there will come a point if we live long enough that they strangle.  It is only David's refusal to be alone anymore that brings this whole novel to the point of being worth a story.  What I really liked was that David is both hero and villain to his own family and ultimately to himself.  To love so deeply that he's willingto keep killing, even eventually his family to resurrect them, makes me wonder about the long terms effects of immortality and the wisdom of Khaldun keeping the Life Brothers to a limited number and hidden away.  Our emotions are irrational, our desires foolish and the lengths we are willign to go to for the silliest things our undoing.  Now on some level we all get and observe this in our daily lives but Ms. Due's book forces us to realize that without discipline we couldn't handle immortality, the burden of it the responsibility, the temptation to play God.  Because one of the abilities that God holds is over life and death and this beautiful book turns everything upside down when it asks what happens when we assume one fo God's powers.  It's a nice touch that the &quot;Living Blood&quot; comes from Christ himself, it both humanizes Jesus in a way that makes us think of him as pure down to his last cell and at the same time real.<BR>I also liked how these religious questions were raised, how Jessica's faith was challenged by the fact that suddenly the God she prays to is made real and a miracle is before her.  This could've simply been a horror story or a fantasy tale but by making her hav to confront her thoughts about God and the temptation to immortality, it really rang true as the kinds of thoughts a normal person in extraordinary circumstances would have,
Thsi book nicely picks up where My Soul to Keep left off, Jessica the first female immortal and mother to a child, Fana who has remarkable abilities due to her parents &quot;Living Blood&quot;.  This book kind of falls short because it goes form the personal story that it was before to a world story, the thought of how would the world react to this blood, how a billionaire would hunt the immortals down and the revelation of Khaldun and the Life Brothers. <BR>The nice touch is the doctor and his dying son, I felt that though this story took up a lot of space, it intergrated nicely with the main &quot;family&quot; of characters. <BR>The whole Fana bad seed/super powers storyline is difficult at best to hold onto because the books are no longer grounded as they were before in one simple remarkable thing happening and everyone's reaction to that.  Suddenly each new remarkable thing is topped by yet another and then another and another, until we get a place where it's a &quot;remarkable&quot; sci/fi/fantasy-action book.<BR>That choice detracts from teh original heart of My Soul to Keep which was a love story interrupted by immortality, in the Living Blood this is a fantasy/adventure tale that involves a family of remarkable people.<BR>What remaind slightly hidden are the Life Brothers which if Ms. Due goes further with this is where the story is.  There are less than 50 and the interesting thing would be what they are in form and thought, having lived so long.  The hunt for them, now that would be interesting because we would start from a remarkable perspective and then get to see where that develops.  It would be nice to see what these men think of teh world, how they've interacted and perhaps influenced it.  What are their thoughts on religion, gender, sexuality (come on, they do all live together a mighty long time walking around naked---I don't mean that crudely but if you are outside of the perview of judgment as your manhood being your acocomplishments because youcan literally acocomplish anything what is manhood to you?), the concept of Jesus as their blood originator, what does that make them think of teh vision of Christ throughout the world?<BR>There are a lot of questions to be plundered here and the book does leave it open that as David and Jessica reveal and share their blood with the world, the Life Brothers must come out of hiding.  It would be nice to see a confrontation in say 10, 20, 30 years between these camps.  And it would also be nice to see how much smarter someone like Jessica would become.  Think about if you could spend an indefinite amount of time studying everything?<BR>Fana is a problem because she reaches a natural end as a story device.  She isn't teh one put directly in danger by teh billionaire seekign the lifeblood but her own lifeblood is too much and manifests all of these strange abilities.  I felt that the deus sex machina ending was a little contrived and I wanted this mysterious Bee Woman (possibly Fana in the future?)needs to come to the forefront.<BR>I think that ultimately Khaldun is right, the blood is too much for the world and it would be nice to see a three pronged assault of these questions.  Humans to immortals and then immortals to uber-immortals like Fana.  As the stage is being set in this book, a very good book, more questions than serious answers are being presented.
What I enjoyed most about these short stories was how they were complete and concise.  In Allende's work there tends to be a propensity to drift as she introduces so many possible roads for the story/character to go to.  But the short story formula forces Allende to stay on topic/character and not digress into irrelevant historical facts.  <BR>The one flaw I would say that I noticed about this book, and I wouldn't term it flaw but there are points where a character or situation touches briefly onto a former story or heralds something of a future tale.  Unfortunately this skill is used so deftly that it left me clamoring for me but there wasn't any.  That was my only disappointment with the book.  Buy it, an excellent resource for teaching short story form (which is what I used it for) or for studying how to do it well.  Or even to read on a short trip, the subway perhaps....?
What makes thsi book incredible and it is incredibel is that it holds onto some very simple plot threads: Hilton can't sleep, a rcist is after his wife and his Nana saved him from drowning when he was a child.<BR>That's the whole plot in a nutshell but what makes this book literally leap off of teh pages is not so much teh answers it gives to each of these plot questions but instead the further questions one asks.<BR>Eventually you get to &quot;What is death?&quot;<BR>That's what this whole novel boils down to and like Jacob's Ladder, Hilton can't accept the death of his Nana.  And why can't he accept it, because he refused death and she exchanged herself for him.  But when finally he starts to hear stories of people like him, people who were to die and didn't we start seeing how this is a master storyteller unraveling both a new question and a further answer.  We then have to question everything that Hilton's existence has perpetuated---like the creation of his children, his marriage, his perception of reality.  I wish that this book could've gone on and on but Hilton is disintergrating so quickly that we don't feel pity for him as much a driving urge for him to be released from this prison, which for him, is life.<BR>And when you're in a book and you want the lead character to die, you know that something really good is going on.  Not only should you buy this book but you should pass it on.  The great thing about Ms. Due and people like Steven Barnes is that they're exploring another element of African-American fiction.  Nice normal, middle to upper class Black folk who have Steven Spielberg-esque adevntures.  What will eventually be a blendign of not just Black and White but Asian and Latino milieus is when children of all colors are visited by E.T. or when the Luke Skywalkers are Asian or when Indianan Jones is Latino.  See that's when cretaivity, genius is exapanding and we're treated to the possibilities of what fiction, writing and imagination can be.<BR>I agree that this book would make an excellent movie but I also think that Jacob's Ladder was a great film and I wouldn't want to see this terrific work unfairly compared to it and lose out because though they touch on the same theme of acknowledgement of mortality they approach it from two different directions, horror and horrifying.  By the end we know why Hilton has been alive for so long, what he was &quot;meant&quot; to do, to be, to prevent and we suddenly get a new perspective on our everyday lives.  <BR>Made me run out and get my Soul to Keep and The Living Blood.
As anyone knows, I'm a tough sell.  It takes a lot for a book to capture my imagination and make me want to really, really read it and regret it when I reach the end.  Blood Brothers was just such a book.  What makes it a good book?<BR>&quot;In L.A., young black computer games programmer/hacker Derek Waites is horrified when a cop attempts to abduct his children- -promising teenager Troy and lovable young Dee--and his ex-wife Rachel. Recently, Dee has been going into trances and reporting messages from a certain Dahlia Washington. The connection? Well, Derek's family is descended from Dahlia and slave-owner Augustus DuPris; now hundreds of years old, DuPris is a sorcerer who rejuvenates himself by feeding on the life-forces of his descendants. Dahlia says that a man named Tucker can help Derek. Tucker, it emerges, is white, has connections to neo-Nazi groups, and is rotting in jail for murdering his family! But--aha!--Tucker is descended from another sorcerer, The African, DuPris's partner, who preys upon Tucker's family just as DuPris preys upon Derek's. So, even if Derek can bust Tucker out of jail, can the two set aside their differences to save Derek's children and defeat the sorcerers?&quot;<BR>That's the basic set-up but what makes this novel compelling is how each character actually has a personality.  The novel does tend to jerk a little at the end, unfortunately the strongest books of this nature can't live up in scale in the end.  That's a given when the book is really good.  The trade-off is that the story really pumps as Derek and Tucker genuinely don't like one another, for self-valid reasons.  At the heart of this book is themes of racism and underlying relationships.  It's one of the first books that I've seen that suggested a physical and spiritual need for a cooperation between Black and White people, I think that's what makes this book outstanding.  You could point out that Derek and Tucker as archetypes are reversed for socialized views of what they should be or should know---Derek has no &quot;killer instinct&quot; (his hesitancy puts him and others at risks and at the same time makes him invaluable as he stops and evaluates each move, like a chess player and Tucker is constantly acting without thinking (his greatest strength but also his greatest limitation).  <BR>I personally believe that the link between all the People's of this here planet Earth is basic, perhaps even down to the blood and the magic realism/sci fi-esque field will explore this area quicker than other forms of literature.  The summer after discovering Steven Barnes I then found his name as a note on a Tananarive Due books, all three which are excellent as well.  Between the two of them there is a slow but steady emergence in the Fantasy (? I have no idea what to specifiy this field as, it covers so many areas but I do believe that at a point it is firmly grounded New Literature).<BR>This book then lead me on to another Barnes book, Iron Shadows and the measure of a book is whether or not one will go out and buy a book by the author again.  Steven Barnes delivers.
Thsi was the last Allende novel I read in a series of six one weeka nd though the story was straightforward after House of the Spirits and Eva's Stories/Eva Luna the attempt to present the revolution one more time didn't quite fly.  It was so perfunctory in places and romantically dramatic that I got the feeling that it was a piece of a larger tapestry.  Not necessarily the characters as in other Allende novels but the plot.  I think either House has to be accepted by her (Allende) as her political country upheaval novel or she needs to make one that brings all of these pieces together into something like War and Peace.  All of these fractuous pieces littered throughout other novels reduces the turmoil of a country's political upheaval to something as banal as a romance novel.<BR>I also didn't feel that her characters developed as well as they did in others, there seems to be a point where the women do &quot;something&quot;, change their outlooks and then kind of shutdown in a spiritual way.  There's a powerful story, a strong character that needs to be glued together from all of these piece women that drift through her novels.  I never get the feeling that one of her heroines is all that incredible for her surviving, more so of a bourgeois virginity lost in the turmoil.  Of them all, a weak book. What might strengthen them in their entirety is readign them as a whole, I reccommend it as a way to really get to know an authors' work.  Read half a dozen of their novels in one timeframe, it really changes your opinion when you're looking at rooms in a house instead of one exciting studio if you can understand my analogy.
I had the opportunity recently to sit down for a week and read six Allende novels in a row.  I say this up front so that you can understand the swirl of Allende I was in and the ability I had to truly absorb the complexity of each of the six and then try and distinguish them from one another.<BR>There is no distinguishment, which both works and falls flat in places.<BR>Daughter of Fortune propelled to yet another level of success by the Oprah Book Club nod is an odd duck book, much like The Infinite Plan.  Unfortunately The Infinite Plan succeeds, achieves it's goal of wholeness while Daughter of Fortune strays to heights and middle areas that never quite reach resolution in a way that the reader can interpret as true.  It's very important for a reader to be able, with the written information given and particularly the senses of the characters, to trust the reality they perceive or at the very least divine when one is being misguided by the other.<BR>Daughter of Fortune ends not quite with a bang but a sigh or a huh?, depending upon how much you've bought into it to begin with.  <BR>Was the head in the bottle the man that this fool girl had crossed oceans to find her love or not?<BR>The book instead does what Allende does best, elaborate about historical periods and elucidate things ad infinitum to the point of not just realism but an appreciation of the characters that distract from the history lesson and at the same time slowly, easily interweave themselves into this historical period.<BR>But did I like the book, you press?<BR>Yes and no.<BR>Yes, I liked the bold action on Allende of blending so many cultures Chinese, American, South American into the California Gold Rush, leading to the creation of San Francisco.  It's always pleasant to see a strong storyteller at work, weaving such disparate themes into an interesting bow.<BR>However, the pesky judgmental, however, Allende's character get in the way of her history and her history gets in the way of her characters.  Both are strong, literally capable of supporting a tome by themselves and distracting from the other, competing in ways that throw the story onto a edge, a misshapen end that undermines the entire product.<BR>I liked Chuan, the Asian doctor who helps Eliza first to leave South America trailing her lover and then to a deeper love with him than she ever experienced before.  However the novel spends so much time unveiling California history and then creating a mythic history of the vanished lover and then another history for Miss Rose and her brothers who raised the abandoned Eliza as one of their own until it's revealed, she is one of their own.  Now here's where the novel stumbles.  It's never revealed to Eliza, no one even gets close enough to her for there to even be a suspense about her knowledge of her parentage.  The whole trick of abandonment feels like twenty minutes of a film that was related to the main plot but never connected to it, not as quick as a commercial but more like an interesting footnote.  However this footnote info, along with the periphery characters it entails isn't strong enough to stand on it's own, making the novel as a whole weaker.<BR>The final conclusion, which is more of a mystery than a revelation portends another book, another chapter in what seems to be a huge Allende canvas of characters and interrelations.  But there is no prior warning that we are walking into a huge gallery of characters and a network of history and ramifications to the future novels to come so instead of anticipating this weaving and leaving character strands loose we wonder, did this part of the book mean to end or is it unfinished or does it even matter?<BR>IN the end, no the real end, Daughter of Fortune loses all of it's feministic power by making Eliza a witness to womanhood, disguising her as a man and never making her stand out as a heroine to be reckoned with.  She in essence goes from one male dominated arena to another until finally she comes tothe one that suits her best and can take care of her, there are women mentioned around her that are interesting, provocative and sorely missed when the novel turns its' focus to the rather bland Eliza.
Obsidian Butterfly is my first Laurel K. Hamilton and my first exposure to Anita Blake.  Honestly, I didn't expect much.  I am not a particular fan of the whole vampire/ghoul writing genre and tough female protagonists are becoming as common as right handed Americans.  I also didn't know the whole back story to Edward, Anita's mentor/male imago or her whole menage a trois with a vampire and a werewolf so all of these pieces were interesting.<BR>The novel starts out with Anita arriving to assist Edward on a case of mass mutilations and murder.  Edward, some sort of Black Ops Spook, gone private bounty hunter who is hiding out under an alias has also insinuated himself into a fatherless family that is so sickeningly saccharine they have dogs, Peeka and Boo.  The great part of these books was how disgusted Anita was by this whole guise Edward has put on and her genuine concern as to how she'll separate a psycho from an All-American family.  Then Edward has back up for them in the form of Bernardo, who spends so much time being sexy that he has little time for anything else and Olaf/Otto who is a serial killer.<BR>What set this book apart for me was that there are werewolves, vampires, killers, vampire executioners, cops, witches, wiccans, shamans, necromancers and so on running amok in Hamilton's world, all seamlessly accepted as existing.  The question is not who or what is \\"bad\\" but to what degree and she spends a considerable amount of time delving into Anita's psyche as she asks some hard questions about being such a hardcase vampire executioner and necromancer.  That was really refreshing, Anita doesn't shrug off the knowledge that she's as cold and tough as Edward, who has a fixation on her as his soulmate that would only be weirder if they were a sexual component.  By the end, Anita is \\"soulmate\\" to Olaf/Otto who has witnessed her killing an Aztec \\"God\\".  This is all laced together with Anita's blunt sexual cravings for several of the men around her and her denial because eof her link to her werewolf and vampire back home.  That was really well-handling, her sexuality, her sexual interests and cravings and why she acts and doesn't act on them.  There's a good balance to Hamilton's exposure of her character to other characters in the novel so that I felt she came across to everyone but Edward, who knows her better than anyone, as exactly the veneer she reports in her brisk, observant first person style throughout the novel.<BR>A nice dodge in the whole thing was the twisted/minimal sexual tension between Edward and Anita, he truly views her as an equal and stands up to anyone and everything to remind them of that.  A sexless, genderless equality.<BR>The mass mutilations, they almost occur in the background as these intense character studies go on and by the time it's cleared up the connection between a wolfpack, the wolfpack's resident warlock/necromancer and a Vegas style Aztec show run by vampires and human/animal beings all lead by the decidedly underused Obsidian Butterfly, it feels forced.  Obsidian Butterfly is a blind dodge, a deus sex machina set-up for another story, another time, fascinating but related on culturally to the real monster that's mutilating people by literally ripping off their flesh, including genitalia but all of the other physical and mental monsters in this novel are so impressively layered and textured that the real bogeyman comes off a little forced by the end.  I personally thought that the handsome cop Hernando would turn out to be the bad guy, that would have had a nice gut wrench as Anita was getting close to him but he wasn't, so there wasn't.<BR>Was it a worthwhile read?  A nice introduction to the series (I think there are like 8 other books and I will read them, I chose this one because it was the thickest on the shelf) and I would recommend it as a seemingly strong introduction mid-stream to a complex world.  However as a thriller stand alone it doesn't hold all of it's water.  Four stars for its' connectivity, three stars for the main plot let down and another four to character development and presentation.  Call it three and a half, buy it paperback and pick up a couple more around it to make it work as a series.  It would make an interesting film series if all of these wild elements could be balanced.
There I am devouring Allende like a large meal, going from book to book, thought to thought, era to era without any regard to continuity or subject.  I almost left The Infinite Plan for last but it was next on the pile so I picked it up and as weird as this sounds, enjoyed it more so than all the other novels that kept going on and on in their spinnings through history and drama and characters and relationships.<BR>Gregory is a real protagonist, I wasnt even sure if I liked him though I knew for sure that he didnt even like himself.  He seems to meander through life with aims that are less focused than an Allende plot.  But this time the meandering works, the sense of simply walking with a character and them telling you there life is really used to its fullest here.  Again m review is as a comparison to other Allende books and yet this style, the masculine voice/perception really seemed to come across.  What I particularly found provocative, worth the price of admission, if you will was the root of Gregorys problems, essentially accepting the company of unhealthy, needy people in his life.  He even has an associate in the law firm he owns who regularly tries to commit suicide in the bathroom.  Thinking about the characters and their spiraling lives made me think that there is a marked ear for humor, a comedy lost within Allendes work.  It all becomes this heavy historical missive and borders sometimes on a historical romance novel that is laborious and in love with its own language.  To read her in Spanish must be a real treat, an added attraction to her work because I can see how the crossing of historical tapestry can become tiresome.<BR>This time though, she strikes the mark in the final analysis of a character and his problems.  Not perfect but it comes closer than the others do in fully executing a character.  I agree with a previous reviewer that the Vietnam scenes are a little awkward but the awkwardness now strikes me as waiting to be funny, hilarious even but Allendes characters tend to be so somber that their laughter is suspect or predatory for something that is about to bring more sorrow.<BR>I dont recommend this at full price nor do I suggest it as the only Allende novel to be read but it is a nice distraction from her main body of Latin American historical/romance work.  It comes as a pleasant off-shoot to the present world and a strong experiment in a writer changing from a feminine focus to masculine.
I love Farscape, John, Aeryn, the whole gang and I was elated when this novel came out.  I eagerly bought it and found that whiel the characterization was dead on and the description of the gambling world was good, the story lacked a Farscapian twist.  The joy of Farscape is that it's dangerous by the end, the twist is so insane that the watcher can't even begin to fathom what will happen.  The danger wasn't quite here.<BR>Rygel getting everyone into hot water was good but teh story lakced ummph!  <BR>I will of course buy the following novels but I caution people to think of this as a primer for farscape.
I agree with the other reviews about lost innocence and teen angst and the &quot;horrible beauty&quot; of the vampires but I thought the books kind of played to that.  There's this whole young sub-culture fixated on death, personal ruin, anarchy self-mutilation of teh physical and emotional kind and this book kind of speaks to it, I can see it being the &quot;Bible&quot; of some fool who lives for dark clothes, clove cigarettes, vampire drama, play multi-sexuality and a profound feeling of loss. I thought that Ghost, the psychic lead singer of Lost Souls was interesting, an interestign blend of the aware and the confessor and keeper of secrets.   Agood characterization there.  His friend Steve, while complex, angry, a rapist and downright terrified of all his friend Ghost represents was well drawn too. Nothing, Zillah, Twig, Christian and Mollachi were kind of too decadent, too aimlessly dark and self-destructive.  I thought that the final confrontation was way too easy---I can't believe that a drunken Steve could get the drop on these old vampires who were faster and stronger. Teh book keeps churning at itself, almost eating at itself in a way between believability and creating a sense of why care? about these characters.  I think there was maybe another hundred pages, some development, some more intermingling of these characters who are never quite good enough to be heroes.  There's a brief moment when all of the lead characters come together halfway through and a kind of charge leaps off the page but then they disperse again.  While I understood the threat of Ann, Steve's ex being pregnant with a vampire baby I never really cared because everyone was so pathetic that you kindof wonder should they even be alive. It was a nice twist though that the vampires can't pass on vampirism and that there were other kinds of vampires lurking around.  Like I said before there's stuff here to be mined, that needed to be explored further---especially the finally expressed thenquickly repressed homosexual relationship between Ghost and Steve.  Ghost came off so asexual or above sexuality that it would have been interesting to see what a relationship would do to him. Nothing and Zillah being child and parent and lovers, finding out the truth and continuing was kind of unique but the older vampires were kind of heavily labelled the bad guys, Nothing and teh rest are caught inbetween but despise the light of being good so there's kind of no place for sympathy to fall.  It's not often in a book when I know that the final battle is coming and realize that it's kind of okay with me whoever dies does---there's no one to root for.  Even in experimental fiction, in plot, if not form there needs to be a clear victim.   Okay, Ann got really used (which is an interesting theme concerning women---I also read Drawing Blood)---I mean really used and abused by just about everyone in the book (the irony of her one murder is a nice touch but it doesn't get the play it deserves and kind of plays as too much of an Antigone/Elektra complex).   There is also an overabundance of kudzu, a Southern plant, in this and other Brite books, the mention of it, the growing of it, the smell of it, look lets get in the car---next to the kudzu, let's walk up the stairs where there's kudzu, they're outside---near the kudzu, they were having breakfast by the kudzu---I started playing a game with each chapter waiting for kudzu to arrive.  It gets so mawkish at a point that I was hoping that it would be revealed that kudzu was Brite's child's name and a clever way of saying hello like Carol Burnett---see you can forgive the ear tugging when you found out it was for her grandmother and daughters, right?   And for books so heavily set in the South (Cajun, Creole, Gullah, North Carolina, New Orleans, hoodoo, etc.), it's weird that there are no Black people (two peripheral characters in the books I read).  What's that about?  The South is a little darker than that even under a hotsun.  And if it's not, then Brite shoudl address why certain kinds of people don't show up in certain sub-cultures---now that would be daring and provocative.   Also the proliferation of supposed gay fantasy boy/men who all have this skinny, taunt bodies, barely out of puberty-somewhere between boys and men grows old when two books in you realize you're in some dirty old man's porn fantasy.  It reeks of pandering to a certain &quot;marketing target audience demographic&quot; after awhile. It would be nice to see a breadth of characters, of ages, of nationalities, of body types, of beliefs.  <br />I think Brite is a good writer, excellent in some places with description, I will read a few more books but I think that there's a point when you're playing to the sub-masses the song they want to hear knowing that the screeching will upset the above ground masses. There's dangerous writing, writing that pushes the envelope of concepts and plot to go somewhere new, then there's self-aware writing that pushes it for pushing sake. There's a difference in being a great performer and a great artist.  Think Madonna versus Billie Holiday.  Brite has to make up her mind which she'll grow into being.  One is hailed as the creme de la creme but the other simply is and has no target group, only a feeling that touches us all.  Think 'Solitude'.
I broke down, I picked it up, the week after I had read Abyss.  Nothing better to do with a day right?  There is a gay guy, Hawk, the guy who bought it in First Contact---big story flashback.  The story is complicated and the writers are given approriate space to work it out but it does lack a little in the fact that Section 31, the Federation and the Romulans set-up a heckuva situation on an innocent planet and then leave when their goals are done.  Also the whole shock over Section 31 existing makes Starfleet officers seem a little naive, even slightly dumb (I was hoping that Admiral Batanides would turn out to be in Section 31 too but alas not) it's human nature within such larger organizational systems to have some dark pocket, some arm that handles things that the rules won't allow.  It bordered on gross naivete and a bit of racism ( I remember when the Klingon daughter accused Kirk and his crew of the same in one of the films0 and she was right, there is a racist slant from Starfleetin favor of humans that often makes them come off as predisposed to seeing other races as wrong and themselves as infallible.  Perhaps the overall purpose of Section 31 is to show that arrogant belief turned on it's ear. Troi finally comes off as useful, her empathic abilities being a threat and a worthy tool that rarely coincided in the series nor the novels. The whole gay thing?  It's a little, well, simple.  I agree with the reviewer about two sweaty guys in a holodeck playing war games, it did come off a little lame and the Renal being bearded and paternalistic was also stereotypical.  They didn't ring true as a couple but moreso as a symbol of integration.  The Hawk character came off as odd, we know he dies so emotional investment is hard and making him gay seems like a clever way to get some accolades, a gay award or two and then not really have to deal with the subject again, I mean he is dead, right?  Sounds like letting certain races in for Christmas dinner through the backdoor, but only Christmas dinner.  The NG crew comes off well, their familiarity and comraderie coem across and the plot is interesting but the naivete of the characters and the flag waving of the writers a (dead) character sort of ruin it in a way.  Picard visiting the family of Hawk after his death also sets the stage for there be no more novels involving Hawk where true inclusion would've let a good handful of novels run with him in the interim time.  Yeah, teh ol' okay-doke earns it weak 3 stars.
This is the second Leonard book I've read (Get Shorty being the first) and I completed it in about a day. It was funny, poignant, dead on dialogue that runied by sense of timing when I went back to another book and the story was almost perfect.  I agree with the other reviewer that the build-up was lost to a rather empty ending which kind of left everyone exactly where they'd begun.  It was nice to see teh adversarial and then comraderie that emnerged between the cop, Chris and the caretaker, ex-Black Panther, wannabe criminal mastermind Donnell, that was something that rang so true I laughed as I realized how this story was like half a dozen people sitting at a round table and the focus shifting from person to person from place to place until people started changing chairs. In a way no one really shifted too far from who they had originally been---Ginger/Greta the savvy but long-term planning naive actress who may've or may have not been coerced into rape/sex with the totally mentally invalid Woody.  Even she isn't quite sure what happened and what she allowed in the final analysis.  I felt that it was a missed point that she didn't leap or connive her way into marrying Woody when he proposed, that would've been a kicker! Robin the vengeful Hippie is a hoot---I couldn't help but picture all of them in a movie and I think that someone like Susan Sarandon would nail RObin perfectly, a frailty, a harsh strength and cunning wrapped with a slight haze of stupidity.  Donnell is of course Sam L. Jackson, Chris maybe a Bruce Willis and Ginger would've been a nice departure for Julia Roberts or perhaps a breakout role for Aisha?, Woody---Oliver Platt and Skip--I can't remember the actor's name, maybe the neighbor from Grace Under Fire?   Leonard gets you into the mood of being a participant in his novels, the story twists and twists and twists until it makes absolutely insane sense and you realize that it's a lot like life.  The only weak part of this was why Juicy Mouth killed Booker with Donnell (did he?)---it wa sliek this was a plot device to get Chris in but in the end it really had too much or too little to do with the central blackmail/murder/extortion story---that and the weak ending are the only reasons why this book isn't 5 stars.
What I enjoyed most about this book was the initial sense of timelessness.  It was several chapters before I could accurately place when this was taking place.  By then I was drawn into Nick Corey's internal world so well that I realized that I was in the mind of a sociopath, not an unlikeable one at that.  What redeems him in the eyes of the reader is that he is playing these games with equally evil people who all have committed some type of crime that is glaringly apparent.  Perhaps the girl who got away, cunning though she is, is the only one who proves to be close to innocent or good in the book.   The story does successfully hold the reader in suspense as to everyone else's motives because we only see this world through the eyes of Corey.  Perhaps that is also a slight failing of teh novel, Corey redeems himself with his perception and no one speaks or does anything to contest this, it's almost as if Corey is the Devil and all of these people don't realize that they're in Hell yet, his pawns for manipulation.  The motives for manipulation are a little thin too---beyond simple malice so Corey comes off a little too smart for his own good, he wasn't really challeneged by anyone, he simply decided one day to pull the pin on everyone.  I think that perhaps even crazy/evil people get frustrated with people, get challenged. All in all still an excellent exercise in concise writing, dialogue and manipulation, I even went and got the French film just to see what I had imagined, and see how someone else had imagined it. Would be great to see as a movie today but it's too Un-American towards the old west for anyone in teh bubblegum Hollywood to risk.
I'm not quite sure if this novel qualifies entirely as a mystery novel because there are so many layers that permeate the book, envelop the senses and relate to the reader about another world that sits on the fringes of everyday African-American reality.  There is within thsi book something that can only be compared to the U.S. discovering a Nazi secret decoding book.  There is a cadence, a language, a knowledge that is carried within Africanist people, thrugh the neighborhoods, the folks that live in them that is apparent here.  That's very, very hard to translate adequately on to paper, to reveal that code, bare it to the light of publication and yet in many ways still keep it private. Easy Rawlins is more complicated than simply being a good man.  He's a bit of a tortured man, wanting his best friends woman and child as his own, risking death to be with them and then still remaining loyal to his insane friend Mouse and telling him where they are.  Problem #1. Problem #2 Another insane man, an IRS man who is after Easy for not paying his taxes and who challenges Easy as at face value, the color of his skin not realizing that Easy will kill him, wants to kill him and is only stopped by a meeting with Problem #3---an insane FBI agent who wants Eays to infiltrate a Baptyist church to root out communists.  Of course Easy knows that communism is the scapegoat for the ol' okey-doke but he's in a terrible spot and getting more and more desperate. Usually half way through a book you can see where it's going, who has to die, who the killer is, even why the killer did something but Mosley turns this around into something that chugs the mystery along but makes it secondary to whatever is goign on in Easy's life.  Every thing has a freenzy, a desperation in Easy's life---love, sex, money but he's trapped by what color he is and where he's comfortable. I read this book in a night and felt a nice comfort in its' embrace, its' soft language and hard people.  People who drift inand out of the story, some mattering, some not but all the same all of them are watching Easy, some with love, most not.  I don't know if this can be seen as the best book from a series and I don't even know if a series can be seen from these books---they stand on their own but shoudl be read one right after the other.  I'm jumping all over the Easy map now but the one thing I can say is that I met Mr. Mosley, I wa swalking with a friend and he wa sstanding by a tree in the Village, and right before we got close enough to speak with shared a glance, a look that communicated so much, as much as Easy does in and more about what it is to be an African-American man simply being, how trouble gonna come for you and your choices are face it, run, kill it or be killed.  Not too many books teach aabout manhood, African-American manhood so deftly.  Buy the book, send it to a friend, not all of them will get it but then tell them that this is why African-American strangers nod, say hello to each other---we all know the code.
Ann Nocenti, I remember her from the real heyday of the X-Men and the creation of Longshot that stands above all else in new character creation.  I remember her from a Daredevil run that was right up there with Frank Miller's--the treatment of child abuse, slaughter houses, the ecology, etc.--excellent.  So I picked up this book expecting to be treated like an adult by the writer and I wasn't disappointed. The prison system (and enslavement to enetertainment) as a whole within this country and others is approaching a thresh hold state that will perhaps not affect this generation but the next and the ones after that.  And don't all of the real problems speak to what will happen to our children and theirs that we so callously ignore (though we will buy them a PlayStation)?  The questions that Nocenti raises about what the prison system (I include mass enetertainment) means, what it does to people and how it ultimately is like a form of deadly entertainment.  To put/pit the X Men into this scenario is one of what originally made them groundbreaking and truly a sight to behold.  In many ways, legally the X Men are criminals--terrorists who flaunt the law for their own purposes and must remain resolutely good when true outlaw logic dictates that they kill the enemies who keep coming back for more.  To get such a perspective on a genuine problem of today in such a simple genre book says a lot about the writer.  It's worth the price of admission to be taught a little something, to learn to ask questions and have a concern about the world of today and tomorrow rather than demand that books fulfill the same opiate dreams that TV has so many addicted to.  It's okay to learn a little something while being entertained.  No, really.
For the first few seasons on the show Dr. Julian Bashir chased around Jadzia Dax and Kira Nerys as a horn dog but then halfway through the series it was revealed that he was genetically enhanced as a child and had been dumbing himself down for others.  One of the things that always impressed me about DS9 versus the other shows was it's organic ability to grow and shift, there were no guarantees that these people would be the same from one season to the next(can anyone out there explain to me why Voyager was trapped halfway across the galaxy?  I mean, in the end, did it really matter/did anyone care or miss them?) On to the book, it picks up a few days after Avatar ends and Section 31 wants Julian to match enhanced skills against another enhanced man who is breeding rogue Jem'Hadar to launch a Khan-esque takeover of the universe.  The set-up is good, the premise tight, the new characters blending well to the point of fitting in and being compelling and even Ezri Dax comes off---plucky with room for growth, for lack of a better word.  The only problem with this novel is that it's about 100 pages too short.  By the time the Away Team is really in the thick of it, up to their necks in personal and physical threats from this new Khan, it's quickly resolved and over.  Ro Laren comes off nicely as does Taran'atar and Kira makes a nice commander of them all but it ends too quickly, too neatly.  Section 31 wins because it's plotted this whole thing from the get go to merely get the Khan's research---a good twist but it happens so obviously that you can't help but feel bad for the new Khan---he had great villainous potential but lacked the elbow room to show off a little.  In order for a villain to be good you have to get the feeling that yeah, s/he might win---like Seska or Kai Winn so that their anger at defeat was real too.  These new DS9 novels should be read as a group---say 4 or 5 at a time to get a real sense of an epic as the stories unfolding from one book to the next, however this does leave each book a little wobbly to stand alone.  I am awaiting exactly what happens to Jake Sisko who's trying to find his father in the wormhole---that resolution should be good.
African-American fiction is difficult to hold, slippery and new to identify, like fresh fish slapping into a boat with no ones hands on it.  Will it flop right on out the boat or will it lay long enough for someone to grab it?  I'm on vacation so I'm tearing through about 6 books a week, whatever my hand lands on I read and I finished Ugly Ways---laughing to myself and nodding with an Umm hmm--y'all know what I mean and discovered that I had another Ansa novel in a box so I dove in. Is it a good book?  Would I give it to someone as a gift and say &quot;Here, baby, read this, it'll help your heart.&quot;  Yeah, I would and will.  For awhile the love that everyone had for the spiritually in tune Lena was getting on my nerves, it was smothering but that was what it was meant to show and Her-Man showed up (anyone catch that play on words?) and Lord it got hot!  There are a couple of chapters that start out with what Lena likes that I can't even type up in here but it was a true-true graphic---not hard and trying to be all hot to itself but simply the naked, sex true-true of the matter.   Into the book I was trying to figure out where this could go, how this was gonna end and then I realized it wasn't so much about Lena and Herman and her coming to accept her gifts and be at peace but it was about the Disease to Please.  I've had it and got the cure (comes in a small bottle labelled NO!) and that's what this book is really about.  Lena wasn't responsible for everyone liking her, being okay in their own lives, doing well, listening to their stupid problems, making sure they took care of themselves---it was about Lena, 45 yrs. old standing up into fully of who she was and who she was suppose to be and not spending her life tending other people's gardens.  She grew up, folks.  That's what this book is about aside from all the ghosts and hoodoo, it's about accepting folk but not prostrating yourself for them and when I realized that, this little fish of a book sat right on up in my boat, let me put my hands around it and I smiled.  Yeah, I guess this is a 4 star book. P.S. What's so wrong with a book being about a respectable woman getting herself well done?  Be a lot happier people if there was less time judging and more time pleasuring each other....One word.  Period.
I've read SOS going on four or five times now, floored, awestruck, enraptured each time, every twist and turn a new surprise arrives. Milkman is a wonderful archetype for a Black man searching for what he can claim as his own. His mind, his body, his sex, money? What is his and not tainted by the past, by racism, by internal family feuding? This is what I call a \\"Patience Book\\", you have to sit with it the way you would sit with a child on a Sunday afternoon. Patience. You have to breathe in rhythm with this book. Morrison is one of those few writers that it's silly to ask all of your questions of even after you finish the book. Pick it right back up and breathe, savor each page, have patience. It is not an easy read for it is literature and you are reading, truly reading. Not surfing through pulp fiction knwoing that the hero lives, the heroine is saved and everybody sleeps well on the last page. Uh uh. Patience. What else but patience could you use to understand Magdalene, Pilate, Corinthians? My all time, all time, all time favorite literary scene that chills me, tears me up, knocks me around hard and then uplifts me: Pilate at the funeral. \\"That was my baby, That's my baby, AND SHE WAS LOVED!\\" <br />Honey, welcome to real African American literature, impossible to translate to film for this is patience reading. Patience, free at last, free at last! <br />I've read SOS going on four or five times now, floored, awestruck, enraptured each time, every twist and turn a new surprise arrives. Milkman is a wonderful archetype for a Black man searching for what he can claim as his own. His mind, his body, his sex, money? What is his and not tainted by the past, by racism, by internal family feuding? This is what I call a \\"Patience Book\\", you have to sit with it the way you would sit with a child on a Sunday afternoon. Patience. You have to breathe in rhythm with this book.

When I first began the Millenium trilogy, a scant two weeks ago I was a little disappointed. The first book has so much going on from so many vantage points that I didn't know how it related to either the overall premise or the forthcoming continuing novels. Boy was I surprised by Book II which at some points reminded me of Stephen King's The Stand where the DS9 crew is reduced to watching helplessly as their universe past/present/future crumbles at the hands of Kai Weyoun. Book III---Inferno goes even further because it tackles what is at the heart of understanding The Prophets, the Celestial Temple, Capt. Sisko's existence, the whole DS9 mythos which boils down to non-linear time. The concept of time having to be first explained to the Prophets and then their comprehending it enough so that they can teach/reveal/manipulate Sisko that what is always has been, what shall be is and that there is no what and that there always has been a thought that is staggering for a tv series/serial novel to accomplish. But the authors pull it off with an aplomb and yet a technical knowledge of physics and technobabble that makes it all comprehensible. It's good to see that the DS9 crew all experience different ideas of faith, belief in whether or not the Prophets are true \\"Gods\\" or merely interferring/insane aliens because it fosters a belief that all beliefs should be respected. One man's religion being anothers science. Even at the most desperate of times, Sisko and crew fight against the Pah-Wraiths destructive intent but never they're right to believe, a critical distinction. And the crew, particularly Sisko and to a heavy science bent Jadzia Dax and the surprising twist character of Commander Arla continuously question the Prophets, their pre-destined path for him and the world of Bajor that allows this final installment to securely lock with the two before into a terrific, wryly funny, dark, poignant story about faith and how the universe is bigger than any one crew. The DS9crew (including Quark (who is both heroic and understandibly terrified, Nog (a boy/future Captain who risks literally everything to becming one of teh progenitors of all Bajoran faith with admiral Jean Luc Picard and the thief/vamp Vash, the hilariously dark Garak and Rom (who Garak secretly suspects is a master Ferengi scientist hiding as a dimwit)hurled through time, non-time, space, life and death have an intrinsic bond of group humanity/integrity/humor that makes them rival the original Star Trek Enterprise crew. A nice point about these novels is that it occurs a year in DS9 time before the final show so lots of plot points and foreshadowings are filled in to make the time spent with this crew even more rich to the serious fan. I am a serious Sisko fan, Avery Brooks fan, from way before DS9 but he embodies a captain, a father, a man, and to some degree though it isn't overtly stated, a Black man (the thought of Sisko being a discriminated against sci-fi writer of the early 20th century who is merely imagining/scrawling the DS9 adventures on a wall that Sisko's son, Jake will one day write as a book himself four hundred years in the future about a man in the 1950's who is a discriminated against Black sci-fi writer who writes about DS9 is chilling, non-linear and equisitely managed and bent and twisted and toyed with so that you actually leave with several fully co-existing, non-conflicting, non-linear beliefs about exactly what's going on. Forget STTNG, DS9 would be the hit Star Trek film Paramount is looking for! Makes you wonder what's going on with Voyager (Seven, Janeway and the Doctor pop up here too).
