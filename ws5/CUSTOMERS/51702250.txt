Although I may be biased as a long-time fan of Rumiko Takahashi, I must that this is a great artbook for fans of Inu-Yasha. Although this book caters more to the manga audience than to the anime adaption, content for the anime is also very well presented. <br /> <br />The book begins with a manga/anime comparison of the series' opening scene. This provides some interesting information on how storyboard artists and scriptwriters adapt a few pages of manga material into a full-fledged anime scene. It then collects the manga's color pages (which were sadly converted to grayscale in the graphic novels) from the first chapter up until the Ryuukotsusei story in volume 20. They are presented int their original right-to-left format, and a great collection of Takahashi's gorgeous watercolors. Next is a series of original manga illustrations that she created for Shonen Sunday covers and the like. A gallery of the graphic novel cover artwork for the graphic novels is included, but unfortunately the illustrations are downsized to mere thumbnails. <br /> <br />It's also interesting that you can really see Rumiko Takahashi's progression of artistic skill by flipping through these pages. They go from the light-hearted pastel colors and cute facial expressions of her Ranma 1/2 days to the darker, more distinct style that she would use for Inu-Yasha. Although I would not call Rumiko Takahashi's artwork pretty or refined, it has a certain vibrancy to it that really brings her characters to life, and converys her story in an entertaining manner. <br /> <br />The second portion of the book covers the anime. Character bios for the earlier major characters is included, with accompanying cel ilustrations. There is a comprehensive gallery of design sketches complete with interesting footnotes, and also background illustrations. While I am primarily a fan of the manga, I have to admit the artistry for the anime is extremely impressive. The background illsutrations are gorgeous, and the character designs are well-adapted. There is also an in-depth study of the opening and closing themes. <br /> <br />The final portion of the book is composed of entertaining interviews with the staff. Rumiko Takahashi discusses her characters with the voice-actors of Inu-Yasha, Kagome, and Kikyo. The director also talks about challenge of adapting a manga like Inu-Yasha to anime, and the art director reveals his thoughts behind the character designs. Finally, there's a comprehensive Inu-Yasha glossary at the end. <br /> <br />Overall, this is a great book for those interested in the art of Inu-Yasha. The only drawback is that this book only covers the earlier parts of the series, and thus leaves out several key characters who come later. Thankfully, a second artbook will be released that will make up for this slight shortcoming.
Over the past few years, manga has been exploding into popularity. 'Main-stream' series, such as Pokemon, Yu-gi-oh, and Dragon Ball Z, are becoming scorned by more widely-read fans due to their overly-hyped status. Nevertheless, Dragon Ball Z still stands to be one of the most unique and fascinating action series in the shonen genre. If you aren't too tired of the anime, and have a taste for epic action, neat and yet detailed artwork, a suspenseful storyline, and villains who just won't die, then this series is for you. Dragon Ball Z was one of my first manga series, and later introduced me to the rest of the shonen genre.<br /><br />While the anime has poor quality animation, a sluggish yet exhaustingly action-driven plot, and very little in the way of plot twists, the original manga more than makes up for this. There is much more evidence of a -storyline- (gasp! DBZ has a storyline??!) it is much more humorous, and the plot moves quickly without losing its pacing and flow. I have read the entire Dragon Ball series (the precursor to Dragon Ball Z) and have to say that I much prefer DB for its emphasis on character and humor, but still DBZ is a great series. Don't let the hype fool you: this is a series that deserves every bit of it!
