A lot of the reviews I have read of these books tend to put it down by comparing it to other end of the world books.  And while I will admit that these are not as smart or engaging as some of the the better books that cover the same topic like Fire of Heaven or We All Fall Down, I still really enjoyed them.  A friend introduced me to the first book and I cut through all 12 books over the past two months.  In a way, it's not really fair to compare them to some of the other books because they are trying to do different things.  Left Behind seems to me to try to simply tell a great story about the end of the world.  It's light, but what's wrong with that?  I really felt like I NEEDED to know what was going to happen next when I finished a book and the very next day would order the next one.  I call that a success.  A book like We All Fall Down is obviously much more intense and thoughtful, the characters seem much more like real people, and it gives you more to think about, but why does that make Left Behind bad?  Can't The Ten Commandments and The Passion both be good movies?
