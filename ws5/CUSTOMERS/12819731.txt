This is a great book. Benny Hinn's ministry has done nothing but help the Body of Christ. If you choose to hate him, then keep your ungodly thoughts to yourself. Benny Hinn is not perfect and neither are you. Jesus was persecuted for healing the sick in His day and Benny Hinn is condemned today by modern day Pharisees for doing the same. Should we expect anything different?  Jesus said that we would experience persecution. <br /> <br />Thank you Brother Benny for taking the Good News to a sinful, angry, sick, poor, and defeated world.
