I agree (now) with the editorial review, but I had to see for myself, since I am a Chopra fan. Editor said &quot;Although Chopra's theories are expressed in a confusing and repetitive manner, the techniques he advocates may prove interesting to those who enjoy his humanistic, if convoluted, approach to self-help.&quot; Yep. <BR>There are better books on the market, including one I just finished from a NDE survivor who educates without the confusion, and there's two chapters on technique that humans can understand! Psychic Gifts in the Christian life by Tiffany Snow. Other books you should look at is the (not kidding) &quot;Idiot&quot; series, which lay a good foundation for several disciplines, like &quot;Meditation for Idiots&quot; or &quot;Psychic Awareness for Idiots,&quot; etc. The Power of Coincidence is a bit flat. You expect an author to generate a shift in consciousness, and excitement and method of beneficial change. This book didn't do it. I hope his next one is better. I see him on TV, etc, and I know he's getting better at marketing, but what about the writing? Maybe he's just too busy now for us regular people. Where is the old Chopra I knew? I want him back!

I like John Edward, and watch his TV show, which is fascinating. I liked his second book - crossing over. But this book just goes on and on with the same, and no new information. I just read a book by Tiffany Snow that gives exercises on how to see ghosts, stories about helping with unfinished business, and also stuff on the &quot;bump in the night&quot; kinds of ghosts. I liked hers better. John never talks about the other kinds of invisible forces there are out there - and I needed to know that too. Not all ghosts are dead people trying to say they love us. Maybe its the folks NOT on TV that are the cutting edge, I don't know. But, what I do know is that I'm going to a book store next time and thumbing through his next book before I buy it. If it's more of hte same, I'm writing him off.
One day in 1995 I died, and had a NDE. Ever since then, I've been reading everything I can on the subject.  According to most stories I've read, I had an unusual one, not going down a tunnel, but experiencing many interesting phenomena all the same. It seems to me that there are some NDE books and magazine articles that are just hype, and published just to give recognition. I have found, through my many years and multitudes of books on the subject, that there is an underlining truth and spirit that pervades the true experiences. So, I have compiled a list of my best reads for NDE books - ones that I consider genuine and adding validating light to the personal NDE experience. I have left out compilations, these are personal narratives. I hope you enjoy them too.<BR>Embraced by the Light ------by Betty J.
