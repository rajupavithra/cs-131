My dad read this book to us when we were camping, and it had the whole family laughting. <BR>Well written, it is for you if you like stories about hilarious kids.
In one of the previous books Mandie and her friends found a Cherokee quilt with strange symbols on it, which prove to be Cherokee writing. Uncle Ned sends it to Mandie's Uncle Writ to translate it, and Mandie can't wait to see what it says.<BR>But when Uncle Ned comes back with the message, he says it is a `sad, bad message' and will not tell her. Mandie absolutely has to find it, so she finds a way to get down to her Uncle Writ's house to find out what it said by herself. <BR>But the message turns out to be more than Mandie can handle. Find out what that message was in `Mandie and the Quilt Mystery.'<br />I really enjoyed this book, but the one thing that annoyed me was Mandie's impatience. She could absolutely not wait a little while to find out what was written on the quilt. She could not except Uncle Ned's good advice and just leave the quilt alone. I understand her curiosity, but if I were her, I would have been patient and wait until Uncle Ned thought it fit to tell her. <BR>But other than that it is really good and I recommend the entire series.

I read reviews for the first 5 books and almost every said they were great books and they wanted to but them all, but then I skip ahed a couple of books and what do I find nothing not even an editorial! and I know why- the books before Mr. Raymound buys the yacht I might give 1-2 star ratings but once they start going on trips my ratings go down to minus. Martha Finly has her characters telling the young ones storys from history, if it hadn't for the frequent exclamations of \\"Oh my\\" \\"Thats terrible\\" \\"Yes indeed\\" ect.  you might mistaken them for history books-she even has them READING history books aloud-and its all written in the books. I havent even bothered to read the last book because there is only about 3 pages of things cocerning Elsie in it.

It's during the Depression years, and 11 year-old Minnie Swift's family are better off than some people. But Minnie doesn't realize how lucky she is when her cousin Willie Faye comes to live with them. They're the same age, but Willie Faye is very different than Minnie. But they overcome these obstacles and become the best of friends. <BR>But the hard times are not over. Minnie's father isn't making a lot of money, and they have to eat aspic a lot (ugh!). Then when something terrible happened, Minnie never gave up and in doing so, they had Christmas after All.<br />I think it was sweet how Minnie had faith in her father, and would not let the Depression get the better of her.
