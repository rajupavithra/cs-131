I am really enjoying this 2 CD series, from Victoria Wizell's Hyptalk.  \\"Dream Control Techniques Through Hypnosis\\" is a very useful and helpful program, which has increased my ability to recall Dreams and become Lucid in the Dream state.<br /><br />I have found that this Hypnosis program, by Victoria Wizell, is very effective.  She simply eases the Listener into the Dream State, and helps the Listener adjust their habits.<br /><br />I have always been a bit leery of \\"Hypnosis,\\" so I made-sure to listen to the information in a very Alert state, before relaxing into the sessions. Victoria has a very soothing, friendly, lovely voice.  When I did begin fully implementing the program, I felt very comfortable with the techniques and her casual introduction.  Soon, I was finally keeping good on my desire to keep a Dream Journal (which I had put-off for a long time, but now write in each morning) and I have been working on each of the projects the \\"Dream Control\\" program is designed to teach.<br /><br />I have found this program to be very effective and useful.  This is a wonderful tool for those wishing to take more control of their Dream Life.  I can honestly say that I have been sleeping much better, since beginning the program, and I get more rest per hour of sleep.  My Dreams are much more USEFUL and Controlled, instead of random, and I actually think of jotting-down a few key words to symbolize entire dreams, BEFORE starting the coffee.  Then, I can look at a couple of words and write the entire dream(s).  I also find myself scribbling a few words, if I awake in the night, and I can recall entire dreams in the morning.<br /><br />Personally, I am very pleased with this program, and I find Victoria Wizell's voice very appealing and relaxing.  She speaks very well and everything she says is very clear.  She has a lovely voice and a great hypnotherapy program.
A discussion of Anthropology, History and Paganism led a friend to strongly recommend \\"American Gods\\" to me.  When I purchased the book, I literally could not put this one down.  I tried.  I looked at the clock, and knew I had to go to bed, or study for college Literary courses...but, I could not stop reading...\\"just one more chapter,\\" I would console myself.  Needless to say, I finished the book in a couple of days and I will definitely need to order more of Neil Gaiman's books.<br /><br />In one of my English courses, we were discussing \\"static\\" characters, and--IMHO--the main character of \\"American Gods\\" seems to be just that (a static character)...however, this is not a bad thing.  There is so much going-on around and happening TO the main character that he is as livley as any action hero, despite his disposition. I could explain this, but it would ruin the plot.<br /><br />Just buy the book.  If you know anything about Pantheons, Mythology, \\"Gods\\" and waking-up on the wrong side of bed, you'll love this book!
This is a repost of a review I deleted a few years ago, when I went back to college.  Considering all that I have learned in college, I consider this to be a valid Philosophical system, so I am reposting the review:<br /><br />I never thought I would be reviewing a book about a subject that is generally lumped-in with \\"Satanism,\\" but after many long email conversations with rational individuals, and reading a lot of \\"Uncle Setnakt's\\" views and columns online, I decided to give this book a chance.  I am actually very impressed with this \\"Guide to The Left Hand Path.\\" As I read the book, I remember thinking, \\"What, Satanism with Manners?\\" Apparently, the Setians figured out some things that a lot of Satanists I have met would be better off to practice, as well. I am starting to think of Setian philosophy as \\"Common Sensism.\\"
I have not read anything remotely like this, before--except, perhaps, \\"Mia,\\" many years ago, which has a similar feel, to some degree. However, \\"Kushiel's Dart\\" is so much more EPIC than anything I have read other than Sword & Sorcery type fiction novels....  It seems to be it's own genre.<br /><br />I have been trying to think of how to review this book, and other people have certainly listed the over-all scenario, religious feel, etc.--however, something I noticed, immediately, is that \\"Kushiel's Dart\\" would probably be much more appealing to Thelemites, than Christians.  There is certainly a pseudo- Christian (Gnostic Christian) feel to certain religions depicted in the book.  Yet, the \\"Love as thou wilt\\" attitude and admonishment speaks of Thelema (Aliester Crowley often used the catch phrase: \\"Do What Thout Wilt Shall Be The Whole of The Law:  Love is The Law, Love Under Will\\").  In fact, I felt many scenes of the story depicted a very Thelemic religious context.<br /><br />Regardless, aside from all the pantheons, religions and such, the story is engrossing in its depiction of a young, unwanted little girl rising through the social system and being singled-out by a very brilliant man who teaches her the inticacies of society and intrigue, as she is also learning about the delicacies and torment of the flesh.<br /><br />This lady struggles to rise from the level of slavery, yet craves being a slave, longing for the master's whip. She is caught-up in a world of seeming chaos, that is actually orchestrated by the whims of Nobility.  There are many seeming contradictions and plot twists, many names to keep track of, and a few Conundrums waiting to be solved.<br /><br />This book captivated me through many flights and airport waiting areas--it was difficult to put-down and I recall staying in many nights, reading in hotel rooms, instead of going out in a new city. The story pulled me in and I was thankful that sequels are available.  I did not want the story to end.<br /><br />This is the only \\"epic fantasy\\" novel (other than \\"Mia\\") I have ever read that did not have the usual Tolkienesque or Terry Brooks style characters.  However, there are some surprises, which I will not ruin.y to end. <br /> <br />This is the only \\"epic fantasy\\" novel (other than \\"Mia\\") I have ever read that did not have the usual Tolkienesque or Terry Brooks style characters.

Entertaining. Not accurate, but has nice illustrations. I purchased this for the 'Vodou Pentacle' ( Web ) pic. I have a friend with a tattoo of the 'Vodou Pentacle' and I respect the concept, as explained to me, by an Initiate.<br /><br />However, the book, itself.... well, it is mis-titled.  This book is a slap-dash, thrown-together collection of \\"stuff.\\"  If you are looking for a book about \\"Voodoo Rituals,\\" this isn't what you are looking for.  Yet, it is entertaining and has some useful tidbits about various (not voodoo or Vodou) magickal entities and whatnot. I would not recommend buying this book because of the title--which is misleading.  Some of the stuff in this book, I would consider \\"Hoodoo\\" and, maybe \\"Voodoo,\\" but not \\"Vodou.\\"<br /><br />I agree with the person who said this appears to be a \\"Personal Journal.\\" I just do not understand why so many Magickal systems are lumped-together under the title of the book.
I am very impressed with this book.  For many years, I had a negative view of \\"Chaos Magick\\" and \\"Chaos Magickians,\\" due to the socially inept freaks I had met that promoted it.  However, various stable-minded, rational, intelligent people (who can keep a job and function in society) recently recommended that I look-into \\"Chaos Magick\\"--esp., this book by Phil Hine--so, I conceded.<br /><br />Now that I have finally investigated this branch of Magickal studies, I am wondering if it should be called \\"Common Sense Magick.\\"  This is great material, very studiously researched, with references to Psychology, Anthropology and over-all Mental Stability, Self Growth, and Accomplishment in LIFE as well as within Initiatory Circles.  Personally, this magickal system fits-in with my perspective of, \\"Oh, yeah? You are a Great Magickian or Initiatory Mucky-Muck.... Kudos.  Can you keep a job and pay your bills ?\\"<br /><br />I expect this book to scare-away a lot of Freeloaders and pretentious folks.  However, for those individuals interested in taking responsibility for their actions and developing as a person, Magickian AND establishing themselves in the Working World, as well as in the Metaphysical world, this book is a great choice.<br /><br />Especially interesting is the fact that this book describes using Computer Programming techniques in Magickal pursuits.  This is a very Current work, applicable to the Cyber Age, with new concepts, theories, and exciting possibilities.<br /><br />This book contains an explination of and directions for working with a very interesting Entity, called \\"Goflowolfog\\"--a cool cat on a skateboard, who helps with traffic issues.  When I first learned of this Entity, I had to purchase the book!  this is Magick that uses Common Sense, Humor and techniques I have not encountered in other works.  Often, Old School magickal texts can be quite boring, but this is up-to-date information that will intrigue and inspire the reader.
I finally read &quot;The Davinci Code&quot; after many years of studying the resource materials, and I loved the book so much that I read &quot;Angels & Demons,&quot; immediately thereafter.<br /><br /> I literally could not put &quot;Angels & Demons&quot; down and read it in two days. For me, the story was very compelling and I was caught-up in the intrigue, Illuminati references and the idea of The Vatican being blown to smithereens.<br /><br /> At-first, it was very, very difficult for me to comprehend *why* someone would try save the Vatican from extinction--but, the author proved the case (priceless paintings, artwork and History)...so, I was able to get-over the shock of the motivation factor and delve into the story completely. As the hero raced-around Rome, trying to save the day, I could not decide which side to root-for. The author tricked me into sometimes favoring the Vatican (no easy task).<br /><br /> I was fascinated and captivated by this story and highly recommend the book to anyone who studies The Mysteries or just loves a good, past-paced tale of intrigue.
I am very impressed with this Tarot kit. Not-only does it come with both the Rider-Waite deck and the Crowley Thoth deck, but the book has excellent pictures of each card, from each deck (for side-by-side comparison, without digging through each deck, to compare cards). The author points-out the diffrerences between each deck and gives a great over-view of The Tarot, with very helpful ideas for readings and layouts.<br /><br /> Bonus materials include a Beginner's lay-out / fold-out chart, a tri-fold cheat sheet of the differences between the two decks, and a nice Tarot Journal--for keeping records of the readings, to study accuracy and ability of Tarot Reading, and to study the synchronicities you might not catch by memory alone.<br /><br /> As the author mentions, &quot;The Book of Thoth,&quot; by Crowley (ISBN: 0877282684) is a great resource, as well. However, I strongly suggest Lon Milo Duquette's &quot;Understanding Aleister Crowley's Thoth Tarot&quot; (ISBN: 1578632765) as a first step after studying &quot;The Complete Tarot Kit,&quot; by Susan Levitt ....then, move-on to Crowley's Thoth Tarot book, afterward.<br /><br /> For further research, I also suggest: &quot;The Tarot Handbook: Practical Applications of Ancient Visual Symbols,&quot; by Angeles Arrien.<br /><br /> However, save yourself some headaches and start with &quot;The Complete Tarot Kit,&quot; by Susan Levitt ! :-)
This is a very useful book to have on-hand, near your Tarot collection.  Sometimes, digging through Crowley's rants and digressions can be a bit time-consuming.  It's nice to have a quick, easy reference guide to the Thoth deck.  I have not yet compared the Crowley material to this book, but I have not noticed anything that seemed &quot;off,&quot; while using &quot;Keywords for the Crowley Tarot&quot; as a reference, while doing readings.<br />I have noticed that most Newbies to the Thoth deck latch-onto this book, like a Prize !  Then, I return it to the shelf and tell them the ISBN #, so they can get their own copy.<br />I'll, do a more thorough review, in the future.  For now, I just want to give the authors Kudos for their work.
I am a Newbie to Linux.  I've used MS products throughout the years, and finally decided to try Linux. From all of the reviews I had read, I chose the &quot;Red Hat Linux 9 Bible,&quot; by Christopher Negus to begin my journey.<br />Luckily, I read-through about one-third of the book before trying the installation.  I successfully installed Linux on a Compaq Presario, although the BIOS always over-rides any O.S. disk, other than the restoration disk (98) that came with the system.  I compared the Linux Bible information to my MCSE 2000 kit and decided to set-up two FAT 16 partitions, two FAT 32 partitions, and leave the rest of the disk unpartitioned.  Note: my first experiment, with only one FAT 16 partition was unsuccessful, and the Boot record was toast. Two FAT 16 partitions allowed me to retain the boot record and dual-boot, properly.  The Linux Bible informed me about leaving the rest of the hard drive unpartitioned, in preparation for the Linux installation.<br />Even on the Compaq Presario--with the BIOS over-ride issue--I was able to dual-boot with MS Windows and Linux (although I am a newbie to Linux, and this was my first insatllation of Linux), thanks to The Linux Bible.  Now, despite the fact that the BIOS only wants Windows 98, I can successfully boot Linux, 98 &amp; 2000 on the same machine.  Most people probably would-have just flashed the Motherboard BIOS, but this was my Mom's PC, at the time I was experimenting.  98 keeps the BIOS happy, and I need the FAT 16 partitions for Linux, so this set-up works well--without flashing the BIOS (and risking damage to the Motherboard).<br />  Important note:  the Linux Bible taught me to install the Windows Operating systems first, to preserve the Master Boot record--which I did.  However, if I made Windows the primary O.S., it dusted Linux.  So, I made Linux the Primary boot O.S., and DOS secondary.  Now, when I boot, I can choose Linux (or let it automatically load), or choose DOS, then choose between 98 or 2000.<br />  Without The Linux Bible I would not have had a clue how to trick the BIOS and install Linux on the Compaq Presario.<br />  Also, I found The Linux Bible to be extremely helpful, once the O.S. was installed and I could tear myself away from the Astroids game--which is rather addictive.<br />  I strongly suggest The Linux Bible to other Newbies. You can find all of the informmation you need--including the Shell commands.  This book seems to be the perfect introduction /  Initiation into Linux.  I also purchased &quot;Linux in a Nutshell&quot; (O'Reilly), but it seems to be written for people who already know what they are doing and already know how to install Linux.2000.<BR>     Without The Linux Bible I would not have had a clue how to trick the BIOS and install Linux on the Compaq Presario.<BR>     Also, I found The Linux Bible to be extremely helpful, once the O.S. was installed and I could tear myself away from the Astroids game--which is rather addictive.<BR>     I strongly suggest The Linux Bible to other Newbies.

This wonderful book is a Plethora of XP information and Registry Hacks, that will help the average user or IT professional.  I loved the Annoyances website so much, that I invested in this hard-copy book, which has proven to be more than worth the money.<br />I was skeptical of messing with the registry, other than basic Hacks to access certain features of Internet Explorer, at work, until I read &quot;Windows XP Annoyances,&quot; by David A. Karp.<br />This book is not-only a great time saver, containing tons of information that will speed-up and improve your O.S., by getting-rid of &quot;Annoyances&quot; and tweaking various aspects of the system, but it will also teach you how to hack the registry. The author gives very detailed scenarios--step-by-step, explaining how to do basic registry hacks, then how to put all those hacks together into a script.  From there, you can use your imagination.<br />This book will make you feel more confident that you will not blow-up your O.S. with some tweaking and it provides information about various applications that do most of the tweaking for you, if goofing with the registry scares you.<br />I have recommended this book to numerous friends in the IT industry.  The site is very helpful, as-well --especially, in a pinch, or on days when there is too much blood in your Caffeine system.
Working in the IT field, I found this book to be very helpful-- especially from a historical perspective--explaining the various highspeed options available.  I read this, although I have been trouble-shooting highspeed issues on a helpdesk, for a long time.  When studying for Network +, I read references about T1 lines, and other methods of highspeed access that I have never used, personally, or only used in a corporate office invironment, as a User.<br />This book explains all the (mostly out-dated, in heavily populated areas) technologies, and helps to grasp the basics when studying for the Network+ certification.
I agree with &quot;blacksun93,&quot; this book seems to be the authors &quot;opinions&quot; of Thelema and I noticed a few sections of the book that could have benefitted from a preface statement, such as &quot;I think that....&quot; or &quot;In my opinion, Thelema....&quot;  However, over-all, this is a Great Beginner's Guide to Thelema.  It is not as extensive as Lon Duquette's work, but please see &quot;blacksun93's&quot; review, for more info about that aspect of this Primer.<br />Personally, I really enjoyed this Thelemic guide, and the author made a great effort to provide the beginner with all of the basic tools, information, and diagrams to give them a start on the Thelemic path.<br />Also, I believe the author is involved with or Founded the &quot;Thelemic Knights&quot; (motto: &quot;How we get there matters.&quot;)--which I highly respect.<br />I believe the author is making strides in bringing the Positive aspects of Thelema to the public, although Thelema has often been ostracized, due to misconception.  Formerly, I had numerous misconceptions about Thelema and Crowley, as well.  So, I speak as a formerly misinformed person.<br />I respect the author for presenting this information amd his view of Thelemic Spirituality and Magick.
I love this Rune Stone Set. The Runes are in Red--which is appropriate--and they are easy to work with. The book is a great Reference Guide, for Beginners.<br />I Also suggest :  &lt;ASIN: 0877286671&gt;<br />Technically, The Runes should be on Wood blocks or sticks, but this Rune Stone set works very well and is very easy to work-with.<br />I could do without some of the Christian overtones of the Booklet that accompanies the set--because it is out of place, and not important to the subject--but, I think the author was trying to explain that the Runes work well when you are in-tune with Whatever God(dess) that you work with, and that a &quot;Spiritual Path&quot; (of some kind) is conducive and beneficial to tapping-into the Power of The Runes.<br />This is certainly a great starter kit!
These &quot;Inspired&quot; writings of Aleister Crowley--aka, Master Therion--are compiled into &quot;The Holy Books of Thelema&quot; for the studious Thelemite.<br />Most of this material will not make a lick of sense to anyone who is not a Thelemite, and doubtfully makes much sense to any Thelemite who hasn't read a stack or two of Crowley's other writings.  However, once you have read a dozen or two Crowley books, &quot;The Holy Books of Thelema&quot; start to make some kind of sense.....<br />Fair warning, I have been informed that &quot;The Uninitiated&quot; won't &quot;get it&quot; until they have been Initiated into one of Crowley's various Magickal systems.<br />So, &quot;The Holy Books of Thelema&quot; is a great resource for Thelemites, but even Thelemites probably will not understand most of the material, until they have been &quot;enlightened&quot; by one of the Magickal groups (O.T.O., Thelemic Golden Dawn, etc.).<br />&quot;The Holy Books of Thelema&quot; contains all the &quot;Inspired&quot; (presumably by entities outside of Crowley's head) works of Thelema, and a break-down of the writings on &quot;The Stele' of Revealing&quot;--which is integral to the writing of &quot;The Book of The Law&quot;).<br />&quot;The Holy Books of Thelema&quot; is a convenient resource, containing all the information prospective &quot;Thelemites&quot; need to get started on the Thelemic Path.<br />It has been suggested that a Thelemite should reread this material after each Initiation, to fully comprehend the material.
This Holy Book of The New Aeon -- &quot;received&quot; by Aleister Crowley, circa 1904 (ev: &quot;era vulgara&quot;--commonly known as &quot;ce&quot;), was created by Aleister Crowley under circumstances which may have been &quot;automatic writing,&quot; &quot;channeling&quot; or direct communication from an entity named &quot;Aiwas&quot; (presumably Crowley's &quot;Holy Guardian Angel&quot; or a &quot;Praeterhuman&quot; entity).<br />There are many inconsistencies in the various telling and retelling of the story of the formation of this &quot;Holy Book,&quot; yet this is the case with ALL &quot;Holy Books&quot; --so, each person is encouraged to investigate (think) for themselves and delve into the Mysteries of The Book of The Law, of their own Free Will and Accord.<br />The following books will clear things up a bit and allow an individual to research &quot;The Book of The Law.&quot;  I highly recommend these books:<br />&quot;The Law Is for All : The Authorized Popular Commentary of Liber Al Vel Legis Sub Figura Ccxx, the Book of the Law,&quot; by Aleister Crowley, et al--which explains &quot;The Book of The Law&quot; (ISBN: 1561840904).  See my review and other reviews for more information.<br />&quot;The Holy Books of Thelema&quot; by Aleister Crowley--a collection of &quot;Inspired&quot; writings about the Religion of Thelema. (ISBN: 0877286868).  See my review and other reviews for more information.<br />&quot;The Equinox of the Gods&quot; by Aleister Crowley--the Creation and Evolution of the religion of Thelema. (ISBN: 1561840289).  This book has also been republished in &quot;Magick: Liber Aba: Book 4&quot; (ISBN: 0877289190)--See my review and other reviews for more information.<br />Also, this one is handy for Thelemic Qabbalists:<br />&quot;The Complete Concordance to Aleister Crowley's The Book of the Law (Liber AL vel Legis)&quot; by Wolfgang Gregory Zeuner (ISBN: 1890109509).  See my review and other reviews for more information.<br />Note:  &quot;Magick: Liber Aba: Book 4&quot; (ISBN: 0877289190) and &quot;The Holy Books of Thelema&quot; (ISBN: 0877286868) would be a great starting point to comprehending &quot;The Book of The Law&quot; &amp; &quot;Thelema&quot; --yet, I strongly suggest &quot;The Law is for All&quot;<br />(ISBN: 1561840904), as well.<br />&quot;The Law is for All&quot; is a great book to recommend to those who are scratching their heads about &quot;The Book of The Law.&quot;;Magick: Liber Aba: Book 4&quot; (ISBN: 0877289190) and &quot;The Holy Books of Thelema&quot; (ISBN: 0877286868) would be a great starting point to comprehending &quot;The Book of The Law&quot; &amp; &quot;Thelema&quot; --yet, I strongly suggest &quot;The Law is for All&quot;<BR>(ISBN: 1561840904), as well.<br />&quot;The Law is for All&quot; is a great book to recommend to those who are scratching their heads about &quot;The Book of The Law.&quot;
This handy Concordance to &quot;The Book of The Law&quot; -- a Thelemic &quot;Holy Book&quot; -- which was written by Aleister Crowley (possibly through &quot;automatic writing&quot; or, perhaps, by channeling an entity named &quot;Aiwas&quot;--which may, or may not be Crowley's &quot;Holy Guardian Angel&quot;) is, basically, a thin book which lists numerous Words and where they fall in &quot;The Book of The Law.&quot;<br />This concordance to &quot;The Book of The Law&quot; has a few pages of introduction, then a &quot;concordance&quot; for all those individuals who ignore &quot;The Comment&quot; and delve into the Qabbalistic aspects of TBoTL.<br />&quot;The Comment&quot; published with &quot;The Book of The Law&quot; was an injunction to not study &quot;The Book of The Law&quot;--which is over-all a method of preventing the possibility of a system of religious figures (Preachers, Priests, Ministers, etc.) from espousing a particular denomination / slant of &quot;Thelema&quot; and trying to monopolize the system (as we see in nearly all major religions in the world).<br />However, for all practical purposes &quot;The Comment&quot; has been given a polite nod of respect and those with common sense do not actually burn their copy of &quot;The Book of The Law&quot; after one reading.<br />Most &quot;Thelemites&quot; are Qabbalists and study the Numerology of words, phrases, etc. --therefore, the author of this &quot;Concordance&quot; has provided a breakdown of the words used in TBoTL and gives Thelemites a head-start on analyzing the intricacies of the Qabbalistic aspects of the &quot;Holy Book.&quot;<br />The definition of &quot;Concordance&quot; :  &quot;an index of the words in a text or texts, showing every context in which they occur.&quot;<br />This is a useful book for Thelemic Qabbalists.
This is an Enthralling Perspective of the life of Aleister Crowley.... \\"the rest of the story.\\"<br />\\"Do What Thou Wilt\\" fills-in numerous gaps in Crowley's own writings and maintains an open perspective until the last few chapters.  This is good balancing material to add to a Crowley research library.<br />Throughout most of the book, the author seems to have an (almost) non-judgmental perspective--giving us a \\"here's the facts\\" biography.  I thoroughly enjoyed this book and could not put it down.  It was very nice to read-about all the things Crowley sort-of Glossed-over in his own works.  Also, I found it interesting that the author began the book with a list of Crowley's accomplishments that would have been well-recognized, if not for his \\"Beastly\\" reputation and eccentric (self-destructive / self-defeating) behavior.  The author had access to a wealth of information, including access to individuals in the O.T.O.<br />I felt that the author maintained his mostly non-judgmental view until the last few chapters--when it becomes evident that the author had pretty-much written Crowley off as a \\"Dirty Old Man\\"--a sad case of Self-deception and a delusory drug addict.<br />However, unlike most of the biographical material I have read about Crowley, this book tries very hard to show the positive achievements of \\"The Beast\\" as well as the more scandalous aspects of the man.  Yet, it is very difficult to perceive Crowley in a positive light, when the Misogynistic (wife-beating) scenarios are brought to light--which, if true, obviously makes Crowley a criminal worthy of little respect.<br />Over-all, the book is quite impressive and it seems to give a more-or-less positive outlook on Crowley's life, although it does tend to dispel illusions of Crowley's grandeur and \\"Prophet\\" status.  However, this book also leaves one with the impression that Crowley did, in fact, follow the \\"Do What Thou Wilt\\" philosophy to the utmost....  The man never had to work an honest day's labor, yet always had enough money or duped enough people into taking care of him, and he *Always* had plenty of sex, women, men, etc. to keep himself \\"happy\\" in that department.<br />I was a bit disappointed that this author doesn't really cover the Occult aspects of Crowley's life very well....he mostly seems to concentrate on Crowley's disreputable behavior, abusive relationships, and the more Tabloid aspects of his life....and seems to gloss-over the details of the writing of \\"The Equinox\\" (a 5 year project, skimmed-over in this biography) --I would have enjoyed a detailed break-down of the formation of that work and the people involved.  The author sort-of skips-over Crowley's connections with Blavatsky, with minor references.<br />Although this is an amazing, and well-written, biography of Crowley, one is left with the impression:  \\"So....when did he do Occult stuff ?\\" (the Occult workings almost seem mere footnotes).  This book details his \\"Book of The Law\\" workings and the related occult workings, but one gets the impression that the O.T.O. was just something Crowley wrote letters about as an afterthought, occasionally, when he needed money from the members (yet, wouldn't touch L500 of OTO $ under his bed, while lying on the same bed in extremely poor health).<br />As a member of various organizations, I know that it takes a tremendous amount of work to keep any kind of Masonic or Occult group operational....so, it seems a bit odd that this aspect of Crowley's life seems almost like a background story, or basic framework for Crowley's Love Life.<br />A more appropriate title for this book would be:  \\"Do What Thou Wilt: The Life and Loves of Aleister Crowley.\\"<br />Don't get me wrong--I loved this book and learned a lot--but, I feel a large aspect of Crowley's life was given the back shelf to his enormous sex drive.  Yet, considering the fact that Crowley and others have covered the \\"Occult\\" territory numerous times, this book makes a fine addition to a Crowley collection and fills-in many gaps that Crowley's admirers or apologists would not care to reveal--one would be hard-pressed to portray Crowley as a \\"Spiritual Leader\\" if one included the extremely Misogynistic / Abusive behavior (depicted in this book) of Crowley in a biography extolling his virtues as \\"Prophet of The New Aeon.\\"llection and fills-in many gaps that Crowley's admirers or apologists would not care to reveal--one would be hard-pressed to portray Crowley as a \\"Spiritual Leader\\" if one included the extremely Misogynistic / Abusive behavior (depicted in this book) of Crowley in a biography extolling his virtues as \\"Prophet of The New Aeon.\\"
This is a wonderful Bedside book, to keep on-hand for those nights when you just can't fall-asleep.  This book has been a great Sleep Aid for me, many nights.  A Prescription for lack of sleep: this predicament can usually be cured with only one or two chapters.<br />My wife uses Crowley's more boring works to put her to sleep, but &quot;Transcendental Magic&quot; works for me.  Occasionally, Waite's snippety footnotes will perk you up, but Levi's laborious ramblings will send you off to nodding, immediately thereafter.<br />I can understand why Crowley believed he was Eliphas Levi (and numerous other famous occultists/people).... Crowley has a similar rambling--(get to the point, for The God's Sake)--style, which he may have subconsciously adopted from reading Levi.<br />Regardless, aside from the occasional glimmerings of Occult Knowledge and little revelations, this book is mostly out-dated, boring and irrelevant (but the picture of Baphomet is quite nice).  I honestly believe that the only reason this book is still being published is due to the fact that it is on several occult organization's &quot;Recommended Reading Lists.&quot;<br />This is a nice book to have on-hand to polish-off the Occult collection and use for reference material, occasionally, but the read itself is quite boring (and I have been known to read through books of Masonic Rituals).<br />I assume this book was impressive a century-ago, but today it is pretty-much irrelevant, boring and only somewhat useful.  However, due to the fact that I did make some interesting connections about the Kabalah, etc. while reading it, and it did help me fall-asleep many times, I am giving it three stars.
This is a fascinating introduction to Voodoo / Hoodoo, with practical application of various techniques--spells, curses, folk magick--for anyone interested in the subject.<br />This book provides a very subtle, yet exciting introduction to Southern style Voodoo / Hoodoo (not the Religion of \\"Voodou\\").<br />I read this book in one sitting, and could not put it down.  This small coffee-table style book is packed with short spells and stories that explain the subject in a very concise and entertaining manner.  At-first, it seems like the book & voodoo doll is a quaint gift set, but the feel of the book and the writings within are inspiring and conducive to comprehending a general overview of Southern Voodoo / Hoodoo.<br />New Orleans style Voodoo is the foundation of the book and it contains a brief introduction to many aspects of Voodoo / Hoodoo.<br />Aside from the great Spells, I particularly enjoyed the section about reading Playing Cards as Tarot cards.  Historically, \\"playing cards\\" derived from Tarot cards, so this is quite practical.  The meanings of each card, in a typical card deck are given, listing the correspondences, per each suit.<br />If you enjoy the section about playing cards as much as I did, you can purchase the following beautiful standard deck to begin using the techniques, per Doktor Snake....then, work your way up to the correspondences in the lovely book that comes with the card deck:  \\"The Fortune Teller's Deck: Predict Your Future With Playing Cards,\\" by Jane Lyle (ISBN # 0312136684).  This deck has a particularly good feel and look for a Gypsy or Voodoo / Witchcraft practitioner--with an Antiqued style.<br />Keep in mind that \\"Doktor Snake's Voodoo Spellbook: Spells, Curses and Folk Magic for All Your Needs,\\" by Doktor Snake, is a general overview of the subject and a personal account thereof....yet, it is a fascinating little book, packed with Spells, ideas, stories, inspiration and is well-worth the price.<br />I am very pleased with this book and it inspired me to research further.  However, if you want in-depth research, I suggest \\"Voodou Visions.\\"  Don't pass-up Doktor Snake's book, though--it is worth owning just for the \\"playing card\\" Tarot correspondences!s book and it inspired me to research further.  However, if you want in-depth research, I suggest \\"Voodou Visions.\\"  Don't pass-up Doktor Snake's book, though--it is worth owning just for the \\"playing card\\" Tarot correspondences!
This is a \\"historical fiction\\" novel of High Seas Intrigue, Romance, Deception and Adventure.  The Heroine journeys across the sea, to escape from danger--yet, lives in fear for her life, daily.  The Heroine somehow manages to disguise herself as a boy and live amongst seamen without them catching-on.... leading to very precarious predicaments on-board the ship, down in the dark below-deck regions.<br />The journey across the sea, into unchartered(?) waters is plagued with daily near-disasters, Deception and laborious drudgery--spiked with moments of panic, Romance and religious epiphanies from The Goddess.<br />Behind the Heroine's personal adventure, is an underlying conspiratorial background of espionage and power plays relating to the shadowy plots of individuals and organizations loosely based upon \\"Templar\\" societies.  Historically, The Templars were International Sailors and the author has incorporated this fact into the story....which leads to The New World.<br />Is the Heroine doomed to the Inquisition's Torments....or, is she destined to be a Representative of The Goddess ?<br />Is she a wealthy Lady on the run...or a Swan Goddess, fallen to earth?<br />Will she survive the Journey...or perish in the Sea ?
This book cracked me up.  I read this in one sitting, and nearly fell off the couch, laughing.  The &quot;poetry&quot; is absolutely atrocious, but the book is so funny the &quot;poetic&quot; curses are forgivable.  I bought this kit as a joke, and found the helpful booklet to be amazing Stress Therapy.<br />I didn't really need to poke anyone in the eye--the book relieves your stress with humorous scenarios of revenge, listed in a convenient format which enables quick-reference for various situations that may arise.  Feeling Stressed?  Yeah, me too.<br />The author conveniently provides instructions for making your own &quot;Voodoo&quot; doll--however, I suggest purchasing the Kit, instead: ISBN 1402700512 ( &quot;The Voodoo Revenge Book &amp; Gift Set&quot; )--have it delivered to your work address, for added effect.

Have this delivered to your workplace and open it at your desk, during lunch!<br />The author conveniently provides instructions for making your own &quot;Voodoo&quot; doll, in-case one isn't enough.
I found this book to be a very entertaining, carefree and useful guide to Expressing the Feminine Self.  Most guys refuse to admit the have a \\"feminine side,\\" so I respect the author for \\"coming out\\" with this truly fun and practical guide for those who feel the need or desire to express their feminine nature--in public, as well as in private.<br />The author explains the intricacies and dilemmas of \\"crossing\\" and gives numerous tips for self-confidence, self-improvement, beauty tips, and covers issues relating to stubble; beard growth, et al.  These tips could be used by non-cross-dressers, as well.  Very few people actually like stubble (about 1% of the people I have met)--especially facial stubble, so the tips in this book can be used even by \\"macho\\" guys, to improve their \\"Cuddle Time.\\"<br />For those with an open mind, this book is very interesting, entertaining and provides numerous website references (copyright 2002, so it is up-to-date) and ideas to try.<br />If you are looking for a book about the psychological implications of this subject, look elsewhere--this author understands that it is \\"normal\\" to experiment with gender & sexuality, so there is no need to defend his stance on the issues.  The author seems to have a very carefree \\"take me as I am\\" point of view.<br />It is very refreshing to read a book about the subject, which doesn't concentrate on Society's negative (uneducated) prejudice against \\"Alternative\\" lifestyles.
I am very impressed with this deck of &quot;Playing Cards&quot; --which can be used as &quot;Tarot&quot; cards and the descriptive book, which explains their meanings.  The standard playing card decks used today derived from &quot;The Tarot,&quot; so this deck is charged with centuries of &quot;fortune telling&quot; experience and history.<br />The deck is quite beautiful--with an Antique effect and an obvious &quot;reversal&quot; clarification mark (outline symbol) on each card--with the reversal meaning of each card listed in the book, also.  The back of the cards are very pretty, as well.<br />The lovely, well-written book provided with the deck is loaded with information about each card, with great descriptions of each card, full-color illustrations of the cards, instructions for various layouts of the cards and instructions for interpreting the cards.... this is not a typical, tiny little booklet, which usually comes with a deck of Cards--it is a full-sized book (160 pages) and is packed with information!<br />Coincidently, I had just discovered another book which can be used, easily, with this deck, although the book provided with this deck has a lot more information.... however, if you want to start with a very simple, easy to remember format, you can purchase this set and begin with the simple correspondences listed in ISBN # 0312265093 (&quot;Doktor Snake's Voodoo Spellbook: Spells, Curses and Folk Magic for All Your Needs&quot; by Doktor Snake), then work your way up to the full descriptions / correspondences depicted in &quot;The Fortune Teller's Deck: Predict your future with playing cards,&quot; by Jane Lyle.<br />I am very excited about this Book &amp; Card Deck set, because I was looking for a &quot;standard playing deck&quot; to use with Doktor Snake's book, mentioned above....and I happened-across this great Book/Card Deck set--which is much more impressive than most standard decks, artistically / aesthetically.<br />I have been using Tarot cards since 1990 and I have added this book/deck set to my &quot;Favorites.&quot;since 1990 and I have added this book/deck set to my &quot;Favorites.&quot;
The Big Blue Brick is Crowley's dream come true. This is the ultimate Thelemic resource guide, which contains an in-depth Introduction to the book and the full story of the creation of 'Thelema.' This compilation contains many of Crowley's most-important works and rituals, including; \\"Book Four\\" (ISBN # 0877285136)*, \\"Magick in Theory and Practice\\" (ISBN # 0486232956)*, and \\"The Equinox of the Gods\\" (ISBN # 1561840289)--events leading up to and including the creation of 'The Book of The Law.' This book also contains numerous important 'Appendices' and a million or so footnotes that were meticulously scrutinized for accuracy.<br />* note: be careful with 'Book Four' (in which Crowley depicts a ridiculous conception of The Scourge used in Witchcraft, legitimately) & 'Magick in Theory and Practice' (esp., due to the fact that in that time period, as now, 'morality' prevented people from talking/writing about sex, but it was/is perfectly ok to talk or write about more dangerous subjects). When reading Crowley, one must often read between the lines. Crowley had a weird sense of humor about revealing 'secrets' without revealing them--when in doubt, reread the section(s) and 'Magick Without Tears' (which shows Crowley's sense of humor and proves he was 'of sound mind' at the end of his life--a typical cranky ol' Grandpa kind guy).<br />'Magick' is NOT light reading! This is a scholarly work that took decades to compile, and a century to be brought-together in this format. Keep in mind, purchasing this book is the equivalent of purchasing many of Crowley's books in one volume (as he originally intended)--with the added benefit of preface material, illustrations, modern research, Footnotes (!), etc. It is well-worth the price, considering the fact that all of this material is compiled in a painstaking manner, including lost material and better renditions of previous editions.<br />However, for those who are just beginning to study Thelema, or have just begun the process of wading through Crowley's works (or just want to research Thelema in-general), I strongly suggest beginning with: \\"The Magick of Thelema: A Handbook of the Rituals of Aleister Crowley,\\" by Lon Milo Duquette (ISBN # 0877287783).<br />For further research about \\"Thelema\\" and \\"The Book of The Law,\\" I suggest: \\"The Law is For All,\\" by Aleister Crowley (ISBN # 1561840904).wading through Crowley's works (or just want to research Thelema in-general), I strongly suggest beginning with: \\"The Magick of Thelema: A Handbook of the Rituals of Aleister Crowley,\\" by Lon Milo Duquette (ISBN # 0877287783). <br />For further research about \\"Thelema\\" and \\"The Book of The Law,\\" I suggest: \\"The Law is For All,\\" by Aleister Crowley (ISBN # 1561840904).
This practical Handbook of Thelemic Rituals is a perfect Introductory guide, or quick-reference guide for Thelemites and other Crowley Enthusiasts. \\"The Magick of Thelema\\" --a collection of Aleister Crowley's Rituals, with commentary-- is perfect for the beginning Thelemite, Working Magickian (ritual scripts / instructions), Researchers of various occult schools, and others-especially, those who do not have the time to devote to doing this research on their own, yet....or for people who are just curious about Thelema, and do not have the inclination to spend a lot of money the subject, until they determine if their money would be well-spent (Crowley was a very Prolific writer).  Basically, this is a \\"Thelemic Primer\\" which explains everything from the concept of \\"Aeons\\" to the reason Duquette saves the best Ritual for last: \\"The Gnostic Mass.\\"<br />Anyone who has ever read Crowley is painfully aware of his rambling, self-aggrandizing (dare I say, babbling?) style, which is not conducive to the beginning researcher or Thelemite's comprehension of the subjects Crowley attempts to teach.  Crowley's style is rather humorous and endearing to those of us who have devoted endless hours to reading his works, and those of us who have ingested \\"Magick Without Tears,\\" but to the average reader, Crowley is almost incomprehensible (I think he enjoyed \\"teaching\\" in this manner).<br />However, Duquette has the wonderful ability to teach Thelema and Thelemic Ritual with a more rational, easy to comprehend method.  Instead of rambling for numerous pages, then saying something of relevance, he cuts to the chase, and gives the reader the goodies, without all the extraneous verbiage (and rarely pats himself on the back, for his good work).<br />As one reviewer noted, \\"Magick: Liber Aba: Book 4\\" is the Ultimate resource book for Thelemites--and, yes, it contains many of the important books Crowley contributed to the field of Magick.  However, it is not a good book to recommend to the Beginner and it is not a good reference book to pack-around in the Temple, due to it's size.  Yet, Duquette's Handbook is amazingly concise, and portable (unlike the hefty \\"Big Blue Brick\\" -which, if dropped on your foot, will probably ruin your ritual with a broken toe!).<br />I know for a fact that it sometimes takes an essay just to explain to someone the convoluted history of \\"Magick: Liber Aba: Book 4\\" (ISBN: 0877289190)--and the book contains hundreds and hundreds of footnotes to explain Crowley's thinking process (not exactly a \\"Beginner's\\" introduction to Thelema).  \\"Magick: Liber Aba: Book 4\\"  is the perfect book to purchase after a person decides that they are interested in pursuing Crowley's Magickal teachings-but, personally, I will always recommend Duquette's books as an Introduction to \\"Thelema,\\" instead of throwing them into the Deep End, with Crowley.<br />Duquette is one of the greatest personalities to become associated with Thelema and the works of Crowley.  I have a lot of respect for Duquette and his writing style--he gets to the point, and doesn't waste my time congratulating himself with endless tangents.  His humor is infectious and his Magickal endeavors are renown, without shameless self-promotion and exaggeration (as in Crowley's own writings).<br />Due to the complicated nature of the study of \\"Thelema,\\" I recently created a \\"How to guide\\" which is a synopsis of a battle plan to tackle Uncle Al's legacy of Magickal Teachings--yet I believe Duquette's works are, truly, the best introduction to the study of Crowley / Thelema, because of Crowley's eccentric writing style.  Duquette, thankfully, warns prospective Thelemites of the various pitfalls involved in the study of Thelema and teaches Common Sense approaches to the subject and Rituals.<br />I would not suggest throwing The Big Blue Brick (\\"Magick: Liber Aba: Book 4\\") at a New Student, until the Individual has read Introductory material such as \\"The Magick of Thelema.\\"  Duquette's concise, comprehensive exposition of the subject will save the beginner a lot of trouble and give the reader a great (and Safe) start along the Thelemic Path of Magick.se, comprehensive exposition of the subject will save the beginner a lot of trouble and give the reader a great (and Safe) start along the Thelemic Path of Magick.
Finally, a book that explains The Qabalah in a user-friendly, comprehensible format!  I highly recommend The Chicken Qabalah to anyone interested in the subjects of; Qabalah, Magick, Masonry, Astrology, Tarot, etc.  This wonderful Treatise on the subject explains The Qabalah in a fun, entertaining manner that sort-of tricks you into learning the subject.<br />Most books about The Qabalah (Cabalah, Kabalah...spell it however you want, and don't worry about it) will put you to sleep-thus are not conducive to teaching the subject. However, The Good Rabbi has figured-out a way to trick us into staying-awake long-enough not-only to get through a chapter, but THE ENTIRE BOOK !<br />My wife and I both finished this book very quickly-in fact, we could not put it down.  After reading the book, my wife made some wonderful Qabalah Flash Cards, based-upon The Good Rabbi's work, \\"777\\" (Crowley --ISBN: 0877286701) and \\"Paths of Wisdom,\\" by John Michael Greer (ASIN: 1567183158 ).  We have found this is the easiest way to learn Qabalistic Correspondences, The Hebrew Alphabet, etc.  My wife's idea was brilliant and we now have requests for the Flash Cards, from other would-be Chicken Qabalists.<br />\\"The Chicken Qabalah\\" is, without question, the most fascinating book I have ever read, on the subject!  Anyone who can make The Qabalah interesting as The Good Rabbi has should get a Gold Medal, or...perhaps, a Gold Chicken award.<br />I will treasure my copy of \\"The Chicken Qabalah\\" and give it a clear-contact-paper cover to protect it on it's journey about the house-it doesn't take a Psychic to see that this book will be a constant resource / reference in my studies and will rarely find it's way back to the bookshelf.<br />For anyone who has ever been interested in The Qabalah, but doesn't want to grow old and grey trying to figure it out-or, for anyone who has tried and fell-asleep or become frustrated-this is the best book to acquire, for an introductory course and an exciting, humorous read!  Besides, The Rabbi has figured it all out for us, and explained it with diagrams /  illustrations, so don't worry about it.<br />You'll laugh, you'll cry....you'll mutter to yourself, \\"well, I'll be damned !\\"  Often, you may find yourself slapping your forehead, and proclaiming, \\"Duh.\\" (Illumination is like that, sometimes).  Also, you will find yourself learning the Hebrew letters despite yourself....I do not want to give it away (so to speak), but the methods The Rabbi uses to teach the Hebrew Letters are unforgettable.<br />If I were to give this book a short description, it would be \\"Common Sense Qabalah.\\"<br />Disclaimer:<br />For anyone, who feels the need to inform me that only one version of The Qabalah is correct...or believes only one organization is correct...or that \\"Western Qabalah isn't `real' Kabbalah\\"...or doesn't approve of the Rabbi's style...I only have one thing to say,<br />\\"I'm a Chicken Qabalist, and I don't worry about it.\\"orous read!

This historical book is a depiction of one method to \\"Attain The Knowledge and Conversation of the Holy Guardian Angel,\\" thus leading to working with Ceremonial Magick, Magick Squares and retaining the Service of various Entities for Magickal purposes.<br />Although this is a definitive source for information regarding \\"The Attainment of The Holy Guardian Angel,\\" the method is extremely out-dated and of little use \\"as-is\\" to most Modern Individuals (especially, anyone with a  JOB!).  This book was written many centuries ago, when the Oppressive Death Cult of Xtianity held-sway over minds, bodies and lives--therefore, the methods depicted in this book are determined by an Xtian / Repressive mindset (e.g., that one must be \\"Chaste\\" and \\"undefiled by women\\" and other silliness to be \\"Holy\\").  This book is written from a Patriarchal, Misogynistic, \\"Old Aeon\\" point of view that is mostly irrelevant, now.  However, the basic ideas, concepts, theories and methods can be easily UPDATED by anyone studying this book, to comply with a person's own Perspective about what is \\"Holy\\" and Enlightening.....  After-all, religion and Spirituality are in the eye of the beholder.<br />Although this book may be rather offensive to Modern-thinking Individuals (esp., women and open-minded, intelligent men), if a person reads between the lines and keeps in-mind that people were burned for Free-Thinking until quite recently, it makes-sense that the author would tow the Party Line to some degree.<br />Regardless of the rather Patriarchal format of the book, I see no reason why any individual could not adopt the basic premise and \\"Interpret\\" the Rituals as they see-fit to \\"Attain The Knowledge and Conversation of the Holy Guardian Angel,\\" for themselves.  In fact, Thelemites are aware of Crowley's personal take on this matter, and I am sure many people have made personal attempts, making-up their own version of this method of Magickal evocation.<br />I consider this book to be a Primer / Grimoire of ONE METHOD of contacting \\"The Holy Guardian Angel\\" --this Grimoire is the equivalent of a Cookbook.... this Recipe worked for Abramelin The Mage, but others may need to substitute various ingredients and/or add to or subtract from the Original Recipe, to Attain results to their own tastes.ire of ONE METHOD of contacting \\"The Holy Guardian Angel\\" --this Grimoire is the equivalent of a Cookbook.... this Recipe worked for Abramelin The Mage, but others may need to substitute various ingredients and/or add to or subtract from the Original Recipe, to Attain results to their own tastes.
I am very impressed with this book!  I found \\"Modern Sex Magick\\" very difficult to put-down.  I am a little surprised that certain sections are espoused as more controversial than others (e.g., Polyamorous Sex Magick being more controversial than Homosexual Sex Magick)--however, society is weird like that....  Regardless, the material in this book would be quite useful to nearly anyone--not just Magickians or sex magick practitioners.<br />Personally, I learned a lot about Sex Magick from this individual's research of the subject.  The author helps dispel many of the rumors and much of the disinformation about the practice of sex magick.  I did not read about the subject for many years, due to misinformation from an organization I formerly studied with (and the silly claims against Sex Magick, in the back of the original \\"Light of Egypt\\" books associated with that organization), so this subject is new to me--although \\"Sex\\" and \\"Magick\\" separately are quite familiar subjects.<br />Considering the fact that I have experienced some indoctrination against the practice of Sex Magick, I truly enjoyed the author's honest, helpful attempt to reveal the truth about Sex Magick and also give other perspectives (e.g., from various women involved in the practice), by including essays from other practitioners, instead of just espousing one theory or perspective on the subject.<br />I found the rituals to mostly follow the same, basic format, but the book is very interesting and very informative--especially, for a person just beginning to research this system of Magick.  The book is well-illustrated, comprehensive and full of common sense applications of different styles of Sex Magick (including safe explanations and illustrations of S&M practices).  It is obvious that the author made a great effort to fully explain the material, instead of leaving the safety of the reader in question.<br />Having previously studied much in the areas of; sex, magick, polyamorous relationships, etc., I had to give this book a good review and will also place it on my \\"Polyamory, \\"Open Relationships\\" & New Age Sexuality\\" Listmania list.<br />I also recommend this book to Thelemites.., I had to give this book a good review and will also place it on my \\"Polyamory, \\"Open Relationships\\" & New Age Sexuality\\" Listmania list.<br />I also recommend this book to Thelemites.
For nearly ten years, I have flirted with the idea of studying Cabalah (Kabalah, Qabalah--however you want to spell it) and I have been a member of several Mystery Schools and Masonic organizations that espouse the need to study Cabalah....  However, until I found this book, I just was not sure where to begin (this decision was difficult, pre-Internet) !<br />Previous to reading this book, I knew of Gematria, Notariquon, Temura and the basic layout of the Tree of Life --and I even tackled Crowley's &quot;777,&quot; but I just was not sure what to start memorizing, or which school had it right....<br />This book cleared-up so many of the confusing aspects of The Cabalah and the Tree of Life--with clear, concise descriptions of the various aspects of the study (with helpful illustrations).  This book is the equivalent of having a Teacher, who takes the time to explain The Cabalah, in detail --without all the usual egotistical, rambling, extraneous material found in many books on the subject (e.g., Crowley's dissertations on the subject).<br />John Michael Greer takes you by the hand and says, &quot;Let's start with the beginning....&quot; --whereas Crowley just throws you into the Deep End and says, &quot;Sink or Swim.&quot;<br />Personally, I like Greer's method of Teaching Cabalah!  Reading this book makes studying Cabalah interesting, fun and EASY (and you do not need to wade through numerous pages of extraneous ramblings to find the teachings--they are all laid-out and diagramed, concisely....unlike most pretentious works on the subject).<br />I also highly recommend purchasing the following book in conjunction with (or because you cannot find/afford this one, due to the sad fact that it is ludicrously &quot;out of print&quot;) :<br />&quot;The Chicken Qabalah of Rabbi Lamed Ben Clifford: Dilettante's Guide to What You Do and Do Not Know to Become a Qabalist&quot; by Lon Milo Duquette (ISBN # 1578632153).  This book receives rave reviews from Kabalists.<br />These two books, together, are perfect for the Beginner.  Both of these men have a wonderful way of setting Personal Ego aside, and explaining Cabalah as a Friend and Teacher, instead of a Mystical &quot;Know it All.&quot;<br />Anyone who has ever been Intimidated by the study of The Cabalah, or by various well-known Cabalist's works, should acquire this book (if possible) and Duquette's book, as well.<br />Also, obviously, you will need the famous &quot;777&quot; and other well-known Cabalistic Reference works (Sepher Yetzirah, etc.)....but, for the Beginner, &quot;Paths of Wisdom&quot; is the perfect starting point on the Journey up The Tree of Life.wo books, together, are perfect for the Beginner.

I found this book to be a very Compelling Introduction to the World of Enochian Magick. ...  My brief encounter with the Enochian method impressed me and Lon Duquette's book encouraged my research--therefore, I purchased this Enochian Dictionary and found myself literally Devouring the introductory material (historical aspects, etc.) of \\"The Complete Enochian Dictionary: A Dictionary of the Angelic Language As Revealed to Dr. John Dee and Edward Kelley.\\"<br />  I would certainly give the book 5 stars, if not for the fact that it is, mostly, a Dictionary / Reference book.  I read the introductory material in one sitting, but the rest of the book is intended as reference material. However, this reference material is Brilliantly categorized as either original \\"Dee\\" words and definitions, or attributed to the Golden Dawn, Aleister Crowley, Goetic, etc.--thus, creating a clearly defined listing of Original Enochian and that inspired by Crowley and his own workings with this system of Magick.<br />  ...  Regardless of the issues surrounding the historical creation (or revelation) of the Enochian Language, it seems to work.  The words, of whatever origin, seem to produce a powerful effect upon the atmosphere surrounding the Magickian.<br />  I have not, personally, worked with Enochian, yet--I am only researching the effects I have witnessed, first-hand.  From what I have seen, thus-far, I believe Enochian is, in fact, a powerful and Magickal Language.<br />  The origins of the language, although fascinatingly depicted in this book are moot--much like Gravitation and The Theory of Relativity, even if you do not understand the science behind it, it Works.<br />  I highly recommend this Dictionary of Enochian to anyone interested in Magick, Anthropology, The Occult, etc.--the subject is quite interesting.
This is a fascinating deck. The accuracy of readings is astounding, and the deck will continuously give the same card(s), consistently, during a reading / clarification of a reading. I have always had amazing results with The Thoth Tarot, but Lon Duquette's Ceremonial Magick Deck is definitely the most accurate and consistent deck I have ever worked with.<br />I wasn't too sure about buying it, at-first, because the artwork reminded me of the Golden Dawn deck, but I viewed the details of this book, via the enlarge feature, and decided to give it a chance, based upon Lon Duquette's other works. Suffice to say, I am thrilled that I made the purchase!<br />I am really enjoying this deck, and I like the artwork. The artwork is not as detailed and &quot;busy&quot; as Crowley's Thoth Tarot, but it is not as Intense, either...it doesn't beat you over the head with Symbolism. I would certainly recommend Duquette's Ceremonial Deck to beginners, but I would also suggest buying a few books about The Goetia, to understand the whole concept.<br />The Ceremonial Magick Tarot is surprisingly colorful, bright, humorous and intriguing. Duquette's personality comes through in this deck, and his long years of Research are embedded in the cards, as well.<br />Normally, I need to tune-up a deck and work with it a while, to tune-in to it's vibe...but, this deck spoke to me, the moment I broke the seal.<br />I believe this deck will be a great asset to anyone already using Crowley's deck, but it will also be a great Beginner's Deck. Of all my Tarot Cards, this Deck is in my &quot;Top 3&quot; favorites (the ones I use the most)--and has shifted to a position above &quot;The Masonic Tarot.&quot;<br />This book is a wonderful guide to the Ceremonial Tarot Deck, I recommend purchasing them simultaneously.

The artwork is not as detailed and &quot;busy&quot; as Crowley's Thoth Tarot, but it is not as Intense, either...it doesn't beat you over the head with Symbolism.  I would certainly recommend Duquette's Ceremonial Deck to beginners, but I would also suggest buying a few books about The Goetia, to understand the whole concept.<br />The Ceremonial Magick Tarot is surprisingly colorful, bright, humorous and intriguing.  Duquette's personality comes through in this deck, and his long years of Research are embedded in the cards, as well.<br />Normally, I need to tune-up a deck and work with it a while, to tune-in to it's vibe...but, this deck spoke to me, the moment I broke the seal.<br />I believe this deck will be a great asset to anyone already using Crowley's deck, but it will also be a great Beginner's Deck.  Of all my Tarot Cards, this Deck is in my &quot;Top 3&quot; favorites (the ones I use the most)--and has shifted to a position above &quot;The Masonic Tarot.&quot;
This first-hand account of Lon Duquette's Magickal life and personal life is very, very interesting.  His whimsical style and unabashed Honesty are thrilling.  This amazing man can switch from seriously discussing the intricacies of Magickal operations, to making you laugh until you nearly cry.  Every Magickian, Wiccan, Witch and whatnot should own this book for the autobiographical dissertation on how he created his first Wand!<br /><br />  Don't get me wrong, this book isn't written to be placed in the humor section--he obviously takes his Work very seriously.  However, Lon has discovered one of the Greatest Keys of occultism (don't take yourself too seriously).<br /><br />  This definitely is not a typical &quot;I'm a big dark, brooding Occultist&quot; story.  this guy has his stuff together, and I have it on good word that he is just as jovial in person as he is in real life--yet, can switch to Magickian Mode, as if taking off a hat and putting another on.<br /><br />  I have never enjoyed an autobiography so much.  Crowley's autohagiography was wonderful, yet his style is not exactly easy to read....Crowley is more like College Courses of study.<br /><br />  Duquette's book can be read in one sitting, yet leaves a tremendous Impression upon the reader.  You really feel as-if you know this guy and could actually talk to him.<br /><br />  I learned a lot of very, very useful information from this great book and I will highly recommend it to every Magickal person I know.  The lessons to be learned regarding various Magickal Practices are priceless.<br /><br />  No matter what type of Magick you practice, this book will be a useful addition to your library (tell your friend's to get their own copy, or you'll probably never get it back).
Taliesin is an epic adventure in Celtic Mythology, Legend, Oral Tradition and many other areas of interest (Ceridwen, Bardic tradition, etc.).  Anyone interested in The Mysteries, History, Celtic Lore, Bardic Legend, Freemasonry &amp; Bardic Legend will find this book extremely interesting. Also, you may want to grab a copy of &quot;The Mabinogi And Other Welsh Tales,&quot; by Patrick K. Ford, to round-out your studies.  I am surprised that this book was &quot;out of print&quot; for a while--it is one of my most-treasured books, and certainly a very mystical treatise on the subject.  Mystics will truly appreciate this fine work!  Luckily, this new edition is available and the Tradition lives on.  Anyone interested in Celtic Mythology, Western Mystery schools, Freemasonry, Goddess Worship, Druids, etc. should definitely acquire this book.  I have never found a more comprehensive treatise on the subject of Bardic Song, and the secret knowledge perpetuated in Oral Tradition.<br />  This book is simply amazing.
This is an Amazing Cookbook ! Low-Carb Hollandaise sauce, meals, coffee cake, and so much more! With 500 recipes to choose from, no one will get bored with the Low-Carb \\"diet.\\" I assure you, anyone can eat well, and Enjoy meals, while losing weight and avoiding the sugary and starchy foods we all crave. Unlike most \\"diets,\\" this is a rational system of eating Good Food, that isn't as bad for us as our usual fare. No need to give up \\"Chocolate\\" or other pleasant dessert items...just a readjustment to our usual \\"Seefood Diet.\\"<br /> The author is a Terrific Cook & a Wonderful Hostess ( and she looks great ! ). I can speak from first-hand experience (and second-hand, via my wife and friends), when I say that this lady can Cook ! We have dined with her and when we discovered we were eating \\"Low Carb,\\" we were very surprised to say the least!<br /> You will not starve eating Low-Carb. The recipes are to drool for.<br /> Not only is the author is a Terrific Cook, but she & her husband look great & they have a lot energy ( ! ), so I think her work speaks for itself. See her previous book : \\"How I Gave Up My Low Fat Diet and Lost Forty Pounds! ,\\" by Dana Carpender (Paperback)<br /> My local public library just ordered 3 copies of the \\"500 Low-Carb Recipes\\" book, and the author was recently pictured on the front page of her own local newspaper's \\"Region\\" section making Cookies, in her kitchen.<br /> Word is spreading fast, here in Indiana (it is a much-needed book in our area), and the libraries have a difficult time keeping her book in stock.<br /> Better buy a copy, fast, before Indiana purchases them all.<br /> Please, see Linda Carroll's review, below, for more information.
For those unfamiliar with the \\"Internet Sacred Text Archive,\\" the site is an enormous compilation of \\"Sacred Texts\\" of the world religions.  Also included on the site and this wonderful CD-Rom, are various Philosophies, Mysteries, Shakespeare and much more.<br />  Regardless of your Faith; Christian, Jewish, Islamic, Buddhist, Baha'i, Shamanism, Wicca / Witchcraft / Goddess Worship, et al...including Thelema and Zoroastrianism, you will find material on this CD-Rom that applies to your life, or your Research in Religion, Spirituality, Philosophy, and The Mystical.<br />  I have been sharing the site with friends for a long time.  I would-have written a review for this CD-Rom sooner, but I assumed it was probably reviewed numerous times, already.  Apparently, word has not spread about this amazing Compilation of Documents!<br />  This is a list of the information from the \\"Internet Sacred Text Archive\\" (World Religions, Traditions, Mysteries) :<br />\\"African, Age of Reason, Alchemy, Americana, Ancient Near East, Atlantis, Australia, Baha'i, Bible, Book of Shadows, Buddhism, Christianity, Confucianism, DNA, Egyptian, Esoteric & Occult, Evil, Fortean, Goddesses, Gothic, Greek and Roman, Grimoires, Hinduism, I Ching, Islam, Jainism, Journals, Judaism, Legends and Sagas, Mormonism, Native American, Neopaganism/Wicca, Nostradamus, Oahspe, Pacific, Paleolithic, Piri Re'is Map, Sacred Books of the East, Sacred Sexuality, Shamanism, Shinto, Sikhism, Sufi, Tantra, Taoism, Tarot, Thelema, Timeline, Tolkien, UFOs, Utopia, Women, Zoroastrianism\\"<br />  I just checked-out my new V 1.2 version of the CD-ROM from \\"Sacred Texts.com\\" and found nearly every religion / philosophy is covered on the V 1.2 CD, which has new additions, such as the \\"Thelema\\" section of the website, Shakespeare, etc.  I highly recommend the Sacred Texts CD because;<br />a)  The CD costs (Money) and this CD-Rom could save you hundreds and hundreds of dollars in the future (or inspire you to buy hard-copies of books, after Previewing them on the CD-Rom).<br />b)  The CD Rom is much easier to Navigate, than the website, due to load time, or age of PC and/or Memory issues.<br />c)  You always have access to the documents, even if the web connection is down.<br />d)  Think of all the upgrades you can receive in the future.<br />e)  Purchase of the CD supports the maintenance / preservation of \\"Internet Sacred Text Archive.\\"<br />  Suffice to say, this is The Best opportunity available for people who are serious about researching Religion, Spirituality, Occult, Mysteries, et al.

I work in the IT / Computer Repair industry, and I personally feel that this book is very helpful to most individuals who have little familiarity with The Internet and all the intricacies of email, firewalls, modems, Instant Messaging, etc.<br />This book is very, very Basic..., yet I can guarantee you, as a Help-Desk Agent, that many adults (including myself) can gather useful information from this book.  The old saying is true: &quot;a picture is worth a thousand words.&quot;  In this book, that is mostly what you get...a lot of illustrations.<br />There is much reiteration of the same material throughout the book, which creates Filler, but the Illustrations are very helpful to the average beginning Internet user.<br />This book is not designed to be the Ultimate Internet Guide, but it IS a wonderful book to read through and donate to your local library, or to give your parents or grandparents to help them understand the Wonderful World of the Web.<br />Most people generally tend to forget that not everyone is hip to the Internet technology and terminology.  This book caters to individuals who are struggling to incorporate all this new-fangled gadgetry into their lives.  I wouldn't recommend this book to Techs, but I would certainly recommend it to anyone trying to integrate with the rest of society, online.
I work in the IT /  Computer Repair industry, and I personally feel that this book is very helpful to most individuals, especially those who have little familiarity with computer systems, internal structures, gadgets and whatnots.<br />I found the detailed and heavily-illustrated sections regarding chipsets, processors, memory buffers, etc. to be very helpful.  Most computer manuals are very technical and assume you know a computer inside and out, already (despite constant development in the industry and the fact that by the time a computer hits the shelves it is out-dated).<br />These &quot;How Computers / Internet,&quot; etc. books are wonderful manuals for those who just want to know &quot;how the heck does this crazy thing work, anyway ?!?!&quot;<br />You won't be able to pass your A+ Certifications with this series of books, but you will understand much of the jargon people throw-around in the office, and you will see flow charts of &quot;How Computers Work.&quot;<br />  I sincerely appreciated the diagrams of a Techtronix Printer!<br />  Suffice to Say, if &quot;a picture is worth a thousand words,&quot; this book is pricesless for the novice and very helpful for the beginning (uncertified) Techs in the computer repair field.  The usual Black &amp; White Illustrations in computer manuals aren't exactly condusive to really getting a feel for the stuff you might be yanking out and replacing.  However, this book is full of numerous full-color, full-page illustrations.
I accidentally dismissed this book, because of the cover, until my wife brought me a copy to peruse.  The cover doesn't really do the book justice--although, I am sure it sells many copies, normally.  If this book had an entirely different cover, I believe it would be taken Very Seriously by many students of The Mysteries, Anthropology (especially), and could possibly be used in a College Course on Mythology.<br />  Greer's explanation of Occult, Ghost, UFO, Fay, etc., Phenomena makes more sense than most of what I have read on the subject, throughout my life.  I have read Secret School materials that do not make as much sense as this amazing treatise on the Paranormal.  I am especially Impressed with the UFO-Fairy connection.  This theory not only makes tremendous sense, but resolves Numerous issues I have experienced and debated, over the years.  For those who research the Paranormal and have experienced UFO, Ghost and such \\"Otherworld\\" activities, this book makes tremendous sense, and often makes the reader realize things in a very ( \\"So, that's it !\\" ) revelatory manner.<br />  I could have really used this book, when I was younger and silly-enough to go looking for trouble.  Throughout my life, I have experienced various Hauntings and Paranormal Events, and often went looking for them, as Inspiration for writing books.  Personal experience leads me to conclude that Greer is an Expert and should be taken very Seriously by Anthropologists, Psychologists, et al.<br />  I doubt that most people who are not psychically inclined or Initiated will \\"get it,\\" but this guide is Certainly well-worth owning just to discourage people from \\"Dabbling\\" in Occult Matters.  Amazingly, this is the first \\"Occult\\" book I have ever read that would be perfect material for Christians to encourage their teenagers to read.  The usual Christian theory of \\"Don't Dabble\\" (in the Occult) is repeated throughout the book.  However, the book is written from an Initiated, Mystical perspective, coinciding with Common Sense.<br />  To make a long review short....  This is a perfect guide to \\"Monsters\\" (the Paranormal, Mystical, Hauntings, Vampires, Werewolves, etc.) that should be on the shelf of every \\"Occultist,\\" Christian, Psychic, Psychologist and Anthropologist.<br />  Please, do not \\"judge the book by it's cover.\\"  This is not a sensationalist, copy-cat, or un-researched book written to capitalize on Vampire Trends and such.  I sincerely expect this book to make it's way into college courses.  Greer has obviously researched this material in-depth and first-hand.  This is the only Serious work on the subject that I have encountered.  If you are expecting sensationalized UFO encounters, this book isn't for you.  However, this book does explain, Rationally, the UFO phenomena.  This book does not \\"debunk\\" monsters, ghosts and fairies--but, it does Explain them, logically<br />  Greer obviously has the Credentials to back-up his theories.  \\"Monsters\\" is being used as a \\"Reference book\\" at Libraries (a book you cannot check-out: \\"for Research purposes, only\\").<br />  For those who may be interested, several chapters included in this book involve Natural Magick and Ritual Magick, with detailed instructions and diagrams.e, coinciding with Common Sense.<BR>     To make a long review short....

Aside from the joking &quot;mistake&quot; on page 3, this book is a fantastic and well-written, concise, thorough explanation of Algebra, in Terms that do not fry your logic circuits.<br />I am not entirely sure if someone could Teach Themselves Algebra, completely, with this book, but it is a Wonderful Refresher Course. Personally, I had to set College aside for a few years, due to working all the time. When my schedule finally became stable and reasonable, I realized two years had disappeared. So, I used this Study Guide to get myself back up to speed. Sure, I had all of my old notes, tests, quizzes and whatnot, but this book relieved the stress of matching-up chapters to notes and deciphering scribbled notes taken at light-speed. I simply sat-down with this practical study guide for several evenings and weekends, before diving back into college courses.<br />This book helped jog my memory and get me back on track, quickly. It seems the Perfect choice for refreshing the Memory Chips, between High School and College--esp., for those who haven't had an Algebra course for several years.<br />My synopsis of this great study guide is:<br />This is a quick, Painless, way to Learn Algebra and Refresh your memory for college courses, or to use as a helpful study guide along with the College Texts and notes from class.<br />This book is especially good for people who spend most of their time working, or studying for on-the-job certifications, as well as college courses. I assume it would be great for High School Students, as well.
This outstanding, non-stop, Enlightened rant against Ignorance, Racism and the over-all Decline of American decency and Literacy was Banned by the U.S. government.  However, the book survived Bureaucracy, Theocracy and other silliness to Educate the masses.<br />Michael Moore has put into writing what the American people are thinking....well, at-least the Americans who know how to read.<br />Moore attacks Illiteracy, Incompetence, Racism, the Corporate buyout of America--at the Governmental level, and he also devotes a chapter to informing us how corporations are plying their wares amongst the children in schools, so we can produce little automatons called \\"Consumers.\\"  He shows the American people that our children's new Mantra shall be \\"Must buy [insert Name-Brand]....\\"<br />This book explains, in-detail the Corporate take-over of America, in November 2000.<br />Fortunately, one man has the...guts...to stand up and lay out the facts, regarding our current political situation in the good ol' U.S.  This book will infuriate most readers, most-likely sending them off on an information-gathering expedition, to attempt to counter Moore's statements (which is probably his secret plan ;-)<br />Personally, being related to a former U.S. President, who was shot for espousing Anti-Ignorance and Anti-Racist agendas, I concur with Mr. Moore.<br />My Wife, and Michael Moore have convinced me.  If the Democrats do not get this mess cleaned up, I am voting Green, from now on.<br />I strongly suggest that anyone who thinks for themselves, or treasures BOOKS should acquire this wonderful, educational rant on Politics, and other issues quickly leading to The Decline of Western Civilization. \\"Stupid White Men\\" explains the Library Funding cuts, Executed by the \\"President,\\" as well.<br />I will strongly recommend this book to everyone...until Corporate America buys me out, too.
Since I picked-up this book, I have not been able to put it down.  Not since Tolkien's trilogy have I been so captivated by a story.  The characters are surprisingly well-developed and &quot;real.&quot;<br />  Normally, fiction does not affect me the way this novel has, but this is one of those extremely Rare novels that makes you want to jump into the book and avenge the characters, or fight by their side.<br />  I love the format of the book.  The author uses a Stephen King style, in the sense of starting one character's story, then alternating between the main character's life story, and other integral character's life stories, keeping you on the edge of your seat, with anticipation.<br />  The characters are very well developed.  I have not cared this much about fictional characters, for a long time!  The author not-only lets you see through their eyes, but makes you feel what they feel.  She creates scenes which draw you in and will not let you go.<br />  I strongly suggest giving a weekend to this novel.<br />  So much happens to the main characters, in the first 100 pages, you wonder what the rest of the book could possibly be about!  However, the book just keeps getting better and better, as you read.  There are times, when you just cannot imagine what may happen next.  This is the most Unpredictable novel I have read, in years.<br />  If most fiction bores you, purchase The Light Bearer, now.  The historical detail and the amazingly descriptive text, combined with the author's obviously vast wealth of spiritual and cultural insight, make this novel a treasure.<br />  I hope I can one day be half the Anthropologist the author seems to be!  If history were taught in this format, I believe young people would be more excited about learning.<br />  The battles, the love, the glory and the defeat are all described with wonderful detail--but, not boring detail.  The details are subtly worked into the storyline and in no way detract from the excitement and fast-paced action.<br />  This is the only book I have ever owned that kept my rapt attention on EVERY page.  Only Tolkien even compares with this author, in my mind.  I only hope this is not her last book.<br />  For anyone interested in History, Archaeology, Culture or just-plain GOOD fiction, this is the book to put on your Wish List!<br />  This novel is also a very good gift for feminists, and women who enjoy the idea of the protagonist / hero being a female.<br />  I swear the main character (Auriane) of the novel is the most &quot;real&quot; character I have experienced.  There are no \\"filler\\" characters, in this amazing novel-each character has a role to play and the most trivial background character may serve a higher purpose at some time.<br />  This author knows how to describe her world (our world), and she knows how to create tension, excitement, despair, glory.....she evokes Emotions like no other writer I have experienced reading.<br />  I am stunned by this author's ability with writing, and I am enthralled by \\"The Light Bearer.\\"fast-paced action.<BR>     This is the only book I have ever owned that kept my rapt attention on EVERY page.

This is a great guide to Tattoo culture, history, styles, effects upon society, et al.  Also included is a listing of Tattoo shops all-over the world.  Of course, this listing is outdated, but should give anyone with Internet access all they need to get started.  For instance, &quot;Tattoo Charlie's&quot; is a famous Louisville, KY based shop that only had a few branches, when this book was written.  Now, however, Tattoo Charlie's has spread all-over Louisville, Southern Indiana, etc.<br />  At the time this book was written, Tattoing was illegal in IN.  Now, we have numerous shops available, which can be found by a web search, or asking-around.<br />  Although this book is out-of date, it contains a concise history of the Tattoo, the people who get tattooed, various methods of tattoing, many black and white photos, and a middle section of Full-Color photos.  This book is loaded with pics and includes photos of famous tattooed individuals.  At the time this book was written, every other Holllywood star did not have a Tat, so it was interesting, circa the creation of the book.  Consider this a &quot;Pre Dennis Rodman -era&quot; Tattoo book.<br />  The Total Tattoo book even covers the implications of &quot;Cosmetic Tattooing.&quot;
For The Mystic, this collection of Poetic Insights is very difficult to put-down.  Once you start reading, it is almost impossible to do anything but ingest the complex blocks of text before your eyes.  Be sure you have some reading time set-aside, before you tackle this one.  I read it in two sittings, but I would-have finished it in one, if I only had the time!<br />  Only Mystics will fully appreciate this Work of amazing verbal, Qabalistic Conundrums.<br />  Any student of Crowley should have this text on-hand, because he refers the reader to this Poetic treatise, more often than not.  Regardless of whether you are reading his &quot;Confessions&quot; (Autohagiography) or his Qabalistic masterpiece, &quot;777,&quot; you will casually be referred back to the good ol' &quot;Book of Lies.&quot;<br />  I never imagined this book of Crowley's whimsical jottings would prove so intriguing or helpful in pursuit of mystical knowledge.  Crowley often refers to this book as his most-important work.  However, don't expect to &quot;get it&quot; right-away.  This is more of a Text-book, than a casual Poetry book.<br />  I am surprised he didn't put a Test in the back!<br />  However, this book is all-about testing yourself, not being tested by others. Luckily, the Commentaries were added for us common folk. Enjoy !
As a student of Anthropology & Religion, I often purchase books about various religions, cultures, etc.  I own The Koran, but have not taken the time to read it, yet.  So, when I found this pamphlet, shortly after 9/11, I immediately purchased it, so I could get a quick grasp on the over-all views of Muslims and the religion of Islam, aside from Web searches.<br />  I find this pamphlet to be Very helpful and Educational.  I learned much more than I expected to learn from such a thin pamphlet.  The pictures are beautiful and the information intrigued me.<br />  Today, while catching-up on my reviews, I noticed that this Beautiful pamphlet will soon be coming-out as Book!  I intend to pre-order it, ASAP.  The artwork, alone, is exquisite and the knowledge is imperative at this time in U.S. history.<br />  I sincerely hope this book is well received and well read in America.<br />  Here is some information about the upcoming book (which has the same cover art, as this pamphlet, I am currently reviewing:<br /><br />  \\"Understanding Islam and the Muslims,\\" by Henry, Winter, V. Gray Henry, Timothy J. Winter<br />  Paperback: 80 pages<br />  Publisher: Fons Vitae; ISBN: 1887752471; (December 2002)<br />  This book can be pre-ordered, from Amazon.com
R.A.W. is my new favorite Writer.  This man is a Genius. He is so far ahead of his time, that he will be Immortalized with Einstein, Crowley, etc.  Robert Anton Wilson is one of the very few writers I have experienced, who sees through the smokescreens and delves into the mysteries, with a SMI(2)LE on his face &lt;g><br />  R.A.W. does not take himself too seriously, nor does he take society, government, religion or Secret Societies too seriously.  This is one of the most Humorous books I have read recently--however, it will only be funny to those with a fairly decent knowledge base of; Physics, Quantum Physics, The Occult, Anthropology, Psychology, Secret Societies, Conspiracy Theories (see R.A.W.'s \\"Everything is Under Control\\"), and a good understanding of the fact that we are, indeed, living on \\"The Planet of The Apes.\\"<br />  R.A.W. hit the nail on the head, with his theory that we are \\"Domesticated Primates\\" --look around, and read the news.<br />  The Essays, articles, quotes, reading lists, poetry, Scientific/Psychological breakdowns of the situation Domesticated Primates have gotten themselves into is fascinating and makes more sense than most of the theories circulating in the media, schools, etc.<br />  I am studying Anthropology, and I have always studied various religions and Psychology...and I find \\"The Illuminati Papers\\" to be a revealing and important book to be circulated among the Eggheads.  Most folks will not like it, because Americans do not read much and this book will make them feel inadequate.  However, many people will \\"get it\\" and they will treasure this Tome of Wisdom.<br />  \\"The Illuminati Papers\\" contains wonderful articles, essays, etc.--such as \\"The Abolition of Stupidity,\\" \\"Quantum Mechanics as a Branch of Primate Psychology,\\" \\"An Incident on Cumberland Avenue,\\" \\"Beyond Theology: The Science of Godmanship,\\" \\"Stupidynamics\\"  & \\"Hey, man, are you only using half of your brain?\\"<br />  This book seems small and appears to be a \\"quick read.\\"  However, this is a book that will often have you thinking more than reading.  I often found myself wandering back to the pages, after some paragraph or line triggered a series of thoughts that carried me away into Contemplation for a while.  I was astounded that I did not finish it in one or two sittings.  This is definitely a Thinking person's book.  I would raise a suspicious eyebrow at anyone who reads through it, swiftly....or look for Diplomas on their walls, stating that they are a Physicist, Neurologist, or Psychologist.... or, perhaps, a \\"Super Anthropologist.\\"  :-)read.\\"  However, this is a book that will often have you thinking more than reading.

I often think of this Classic tale of Intrigue, Fantasy, Sex, Slavery, and Freedom--set in a Romanesque Empire, in a harsh world of Constant Struggle for Survival.<br />  I read this book approximately ten years ago, and I still think about it often.  Richard Adams writes a very Compelling tale that should be placed among the Greats, such as Tolkien.  Unfortunately, when I was young, I turned books in for credit on new books and I have not seen a copy since that time.  I searched for this book, today, to make absolutely sure I have a copy for my library.<br />  I cannot wait to share this book with others, and I strongly hope it stays in print.  This novel deserves far more shelf space that it receives.<br />  I have never forgotten the Characters in \\"Maia.\\"  They are truly well-written and the story grabs you, pulls you in and does not let-go.  This is one of those rare books that you do not want to End.<br />  Lately, I have been reading \\"The Light Bearer,\\" and it reminds me of \\"Maia.\\"  It seems anyone who likes one would like the other.  \\"Maia\\" has that Romanesque feel, in the capitol city--and other, even more Dangerous lands are explored.<br />  This is an Epic Adventure Tale, that you will never forget.
As someone often mistaken for a woman, and as an Anthropologist, I highly recommend this wonderful, whimsical, Enlightened view of the Society vs. Gender dilemma.<br />  People often do not realize that a person must read stacks and stacks of books, to even come-close to comprehending WHY Gender is such a Big Deal in most cultures (especially American culture, which is extremely Repressed and dysfunctional).<br />  I have been asking myself Gender-related questions since I was a small child.  Unfortunately, being raised in an environment that precluded the possibility of asking my parents any questions, or talking about such things in any other circumstances, all I had were Books.<br />  Obviously, Kate has read her fair share of books, magazines, Psychological arguments (I mean views), etc.  Luckily, she wrote about her research, personal experiences, the challenges involved with living \\"Alternative Lifestyles\\" and society's response to people dropping out of the tribe....<br />  The most inspiring and interesting concept I found in this work, was the idea that \\"Gender\\" is a \\"Tribal\\" concept.  If you do not act the way your Tribe (\\"Male,\\" \\"Female\\"  / \\"Man,\\" \\"Woman\\") WANTS you to act, you get kicked-out.<br />  I enjoy studying Anthropology and this concept makes more sense than a lot of the other theories I have read.<br />  When Kate puts things into perspective, and shows (easily) that the Man Tribe vs. Woman Tribe theory is in-action every day, in most cultures....it is like a Revelation.<br />  When you read this book, you realize that Males act as-if they are a Phallic Cult & Females act as-if they are a Non-phallic Cult.  Both Cults struggle to preserve their Born adherents and Demand they remain in the Cult of their birth (much like someone being born into a Religious Cult, from-which you cannot escape).<br />  As I read Kate's book, I thought, \\"She should be writing Text books and Psychology papers....Anthropological Research.\\"<br />  It is wonderful to see someone bucking the System and providing an Insider's view of the Struggle between the Sexes.<br />  I believe that if more people were honest with themselves, the Crime Rate, Depression, Homophobia, and numerous other Cultural Ignorance Factors would be reduced, phenomenally.<br />  \\"Gender Outlaw\\" is a great start to educating the masses.<br />  Gender issues have been confused, ridiculed, demonized and otherwise caused much unnecessary Grief for far too long.  Patriarchal society has given us a Goofball, uneducated view of what Gender is, how it works, & WHY we are the way we are.<br />  \\"Gender Outlaw\\" is a fresh, new perspective on Gender issues, and it is written in a humorous, easy to digest format.<br />  Personally, I miss the 80's.  It seems, people were a lot happier when they were Androgynous.rful to see someone bucking the System and providing an Insider's view of the Struggle between the Sexes.<BR>     I believe that if more people were honest with themselves, the Crime Rate, Depression, Homophobia, and numerous other Cultural Ignorance Factors would be reduced, phenomenally.<BR>     \\"Gender Outlaw\\" is a great start to educating the masses.<BR>     Gender issues have been confused, ridiculed, demonized and otherwise caused much unnecessary Grief for far too long.

Confused by numerous web sites ?  Web sites disappear, leaving you even more confused ?  If you want to research the (in)famous org, known as the O.T.O. (\\"Ordo Templi Orientis\\"), this is the book you need to get started.  I once believed the OTO was a lot different than it actually is, due to various factions claiming the name \\"OTO.\\"  However, this book clears everything up and relates the story of the Lawsuit that settled the matter, once and for all.  The \\"Official\\" OTO, with legal rights to the name, and Tax-exempt status, is explained & explored, in-depth, in \\"The Equinox : The Review of Scientific Illuminism : The Official Organ of the O.T.O. [ Volume III ] Number 10.\\"<br />I have been researching occultism, religion, anthropology, etc. for over ten years, and this is the only book I have ever found that gives an adequate, accurate and concise explanation of the OTO, Thelema, & Crowley's Raison d'etre.<br />Anyone can build a website, but this book contains the Legal information, related to the OTO, Crowley's estate, etc.<br />The Bonus materials are good reading and make-up for the dryness of some of the technicalities involved in explaining the history of the OTO.  This volume contains \\"The Book of The Law,\\" clarifications about the religion of \\"Thelema,\\"  & Masonic / Templar connections to the organization of the OTO.<br />Anyone researching religion, occultism, \\"Secret Societies,\\" Crowley, Thelema, Masonry, Anthropology or Sociology should definitely put this one on their wish list.<br />This is not the most exciting book you will ever read, but it IS crammed with information, in an easy to ingest format.  Also, purchasing this book is like buying several for the price of one!

Prepare to be enthralled and sucked into the Paranoid world of Conspiracy Theory.<br />All the \\"Secret Societies,\\" supposed CIA / FBI \\"cover-ups,\\" assassinations, occult groups, mind control scenarios, banking, NWO, UFO-related, \\"regression therapy\\" theories, delusions and confusions you can handle.<br />This book is an Amazing collection of all the most popular Conspiracies, urban myths, paranoid delusions, Cult Weirdness and valid info, imaginable.

Couples and Individuals will love this fast read, jam-packed with useful information about responsible non-monogamous relationships.  The sections are clearly defined and illustrated, making this book the perfect primer for the practice of Polyamory.<br />This is a concise and easily referenced collection of modern thought / research on the subject & Practice of responsible non-monogamy, without complicated technical jargon or reference to obscure medical journals....  In other words, it is a great, easy to read book that you can share with your friends, Lover(s) and prospective love interests.<br />For those familiar with the basic concepts of non-monogamy / Polyamory--and the work of Richard Sutphen (Radical Spirituality), Wayne Dyer, etc.--\\"Polyamory : The New Love Without Limits : Secrets of Sustainable Intimate Relationships,\\"<br />by Deborah M, Dr. Anapol, will be a perfect addition to your library (if you can get it back from your friends).<br />This book introduces the subject to the beginner with comprehensive, fun and exciting concepts that will peak the interest of nearly anyone.<br />For those who are sick of being bound to ridiculous, antiquated standards of \\"morality\\" that lead to Divorce, heartbreak and disputes over children, this book offers a wonderful, Sensible alternative !  However, people with extreme jealous tendencies may not be ready for this New Age philosophy of \\"Love without Limits\\" (or, Nearly without limits).<br />These practices Work, in relationships, without question--if all the Love/sexual partners are in agreement.  Each type of Multiple relationship is described with detail and diagramed for reference while discussing these issues with your Loved one(s).<br />The Author of this book did a wonderful job collecting information & resources to help those along the path, which are also seeking a more Honest, Sensible, Responsible and Self-fulfilling lifestyle.<br />The flow and ease with-which the author explains these issues (and the occasional cartoons) should help anyone break the ice, if they want to discuss \\"Opening\\" their relationship to a higher level of Experience, Love and Trust.casional cartoons) should help anyone break the ice, if they want to discuss \\"Opening\\" their relationship to a higher level of Experience, Love and Trust.
I have been hearing about this, since I was a child !  This book should be subtitled \\"The Birds & The Bees\\"-well, mostly, it's about the Birds.  This book details the Soap Opera lifestyle of Birds, from a Humorous, Scientific point of view, but strives to inform the reader about \\"The Myth of Monogamy,\\" without inundating us with complicated scientific Jargon.<br />The Myth of human Monogamy is explained, by first back-tracking and giving examples from the animal kingdom, proving that the former scientific beliefs of Monogamous animal behavior was based more upon Human Indoctrinization, than actual fact-unscientific views and Clouded Perception, filtered through the lens of religious / social beliefs.  This book sets the record straight and proves, through the tremendous efforts of scientists of the present era, that Monogamy is almost entirely a Myth in the various Animal as well as Human species.<br />Most people of Jealous inclination will probably hate this book, because it explains the common sense Reality of human interaction, and denounces the silly Myths and social lies we have been indoctrinated with since birth, by society and religion.  After reading this book, there can really be no doubt that Humans are NOT Monogamous creatures.<br />Your parents always told you about the Birds and the Bees....  Well, according to the Birds (and complicated, Scientific DNA research in that field), they say \\"it's ok to be non-monogamous (even if you must Pretend to be monogamous).\\"<br />Open-minded individuals will love this well-written, accessible research and explanation of human and animal sexual patterns.  However, if you are looking for the Spiritual or personal aspects of Non-Monogamy and how this lifestyle affects individuals, families and relationships on a more Personal level, please see my Listmania list on the subject of \\"Polyamory.\\"
This small collection of Essays and notes from a Rocket Scientist, who mysteriously perished in a lab \\"accident,\\" while preparing this work, is an astounding and comprehensive dissertation on the Current lack of Freedom; in Thought, Religion, Sexuality and Lifestyle in America.<br />When this material was written, it was not only blasphemous, but dangerous Politically.  This man was certainly ahead of his time....a Harbinger of a Thinking Age of Reason and Common Sense.<br />There is more Truth in this thin collection of Essays, than can be found in numerous stacks of books.  I highly recommend this work to anyone and everyone.  Any person who has ever thought for themselves, should read this book and add it to their philosophical library.<br />Freedom certainly is a \\"Two Edged Sword,\\" that must be fought with and for, with zeal and courage.  Parsons explains, rationally, why the False Morality predominant in America doesn't make a lick of sense and never has.  He explains with poetic, scientific Reason, Logic and Mysticism why our society is dysfunctional and self-destructive.<br />This book is also a Wonderful addition to any Feminist's library, or Witch's book shelf.  Parsons was obviously well-ahead of his time on issues of Women's Rights, and the Rights of Minorities.<br />It's no wonder he had an \\"accident\\" in his laboratory, considering the lack of \\"Freedom of Speech\\" in America and the lack of intellectual thought in our country.<br />Basically, this book is a collection of Common sense.... However, he was viewed as a radical, by predominantly Patriarchal Society.<br />If I could, I would give a copy of this book to everyone I met, or communicated with.  Parsons was, without question, a Genius and a Martyr for Freedom of Speech, Religion, Sexuality and Common Sense.
This is the Best Astrology book I have owned...several times... and the only one that never comes back to me.  I do not suggest loaning this book to anyone.  Make them buy it !<br />This book is astoundingly Accurate and Soooooo much fun to research (to see if it *really* measures up).  I have owned this book for a long time and discussed it with numerous individuals and couples.  Everyone seems to agree that it is very Accurate and amazingly easy to comprehend or use.<br />Most Astrology books are boring and unexplainable to \\"Non-Believers,\\" but Sexual Astrology speaks for and proves itself.<br />The advice in this work is sound, and very helpful in relationship matters.  This book will certainly help you work things out, in a Polygamous relationship ;)
Regardless of other reviewers comments about Crowley's mountain-climbing adventures, and other travels, I thoroughly enjoyed every minute detail !  Obviously, his mountain climbing experiences and world travel helped him to develop his \\"Will,\\" which enabled him to become the most famous Occultist in history.  Every time I had a spare moment, I sat down with this \\"Autohagiography\\" and poured over the pages until I found myself in a delimma.....only 6 pages until it is finished. More ! More !<br />Two years ago, I would not have imagined I would be reviewing Crowley books.  Most of the information about this man seems to have been written by people who took all the myths surrounding Crowley seriously, or preferred to inform the reading public of the Controversial / Tabloid exploits Crowley was *supposedly* involved with.  However, despite various Occult Researchers' whimsical attitude toward truth vs. tabloid money-making rumors, this book reveals Crowley as a MAN, not a \\"Beast.\\"<br />To read the Confessions is to read of a Poetic Young man, who happened to be born into a society Indoctrinated with ridiculous concepts that his level of Intelligence simply could not submit to.  The Subversive, Slave-like religion of his birth pushed him to explore other fields of interest and to study Comparative Religion.  Reading his autobiography, it is obvious that he was simply too intelligent to be kept down in the mire of \\"Because.\\"<br />This man thought for himself and lived for himself--despite society's ridiculous posturing and false \\"morality.\\"<br />Basically, Crowley \\"tells it like it is,\\" instead of adopting the complacent, indoctrinated attitude of his era and contrymen.<br />There is very little \\"Occult\\" information in this book--in fact, he mostly writes about his Mountaineering, Poetry and World Travel throughout most of these \\"Confessions.\\"  The occult-related incidents often seem to be thrown-in as an after-thought, as-if he would much-rather be remembered as a Poet.<br />Personally, I learned quite a lot about Anthropology from this collection of Travels in India, China, South America, etc.  It is such a shame that the intellectual level of society (or lack thereof) cannot comprehend Great Men.  Crowley was extremely well-educated--therefore, it is unlikely that younger generations will comprehend even a fourth of the material in this autobiography.  Well-read individuals will be thrilled to add the Confessions to their library !<br />Don't be frightened by propagandists and money-mongers--this book was written straight from the Horus' mouth and sets the record straight.<br />Personally, I learned quite a lot about Anthropology from this collection of Travels in India, China, South America, etc.  It is such a shame that the intellectual level of society (or lack thereof) cannot comprehend Great Men.

Masks of The Illuminati is a fast-paced Adventure and Detective Story, with Albert Einstein &amp; James Joyce playing Sherlock Holmes and Dr. Watson, in the historical setting of The Real World.  However, the characters also spend a great deal of time in the Metaphysical world, as well.  The average reader will not comprehend half of this book--but, that is the excitement of the adventure!  Only the Illuminated truly &quot;get it.&quot; ;)<br />Seriously, Students of &quot;The Mysteries&quot; will have a field day (or an Astral Field Trip) with this thrilling &quot;fictional&quot; novel.<br />Robert Anton Wilson must be a genius to have incorporated so much historical and metaphysical Truth, into this &quot;story&quot; of a young, wealthy, well-educated Englishman being Initiated into a branch of The Golden Dawn, while trying to investigate a series of strange &quot;occult&quot; attacks in Scotland, against a Presbyterian minister....fighting both the forces of Darkness and his own repressed sexual tendencies, simultaneously !<br />This is a fascinating journey into the world of occult organizations and Initiation, climaxing in a most unusual and exciting manner....leading the reader to strongly desire clapping Aleister Crowley on the back while saying, &quot;Well-done, 'ol chap!&quot;<br />I strongly doubt that non-occultists will understand this great novel--but, the Story holds it's own and being a student of The Mysteries is not a Prerequisite.  For those in the dark, a quick online search can fill in the gaps, as you read.<br />This book is more fast-paced than Focault's Pendulumn and the scenes with Einstein &amp; Joyce as Sleuths are very well-constructed.  You will feel that you are in the room with them...listening attentively and anxiously awaiting the Conclusion !
This wonderful story of the life of Jesus of Nazareth, explains his travels in the ancient world and his connections with India. This book will be a great addition to any researcher's library.  Numerous URLs are provided for further research on the internet. Great for Christians and non-Christians as well.<br />Excellent Christmas gift for the Spiritual person, Researcher, Historian, or Arm-Chair Philosopher in your family.
Do yourself a favor and read-up on Yoga, Witchcraft, and Occultism...then, read this book of Excellent Magickal Instruction.  I understood it because I have been delving into Hinduism and I have studied Paganism/Witchcraft.  Crowley writes, as usual, for the Experienced, not the Beginner.<br />This is a small book, yet it has more information than most thick tomes of &quot;occult&quot; knowledge.  There is nothing &quot;fluffy&quot; about &quot;Book 4.&quot;  Crowley supplies us with a concise record of the Basics of Magick, without embellishing or beating around the bush....of course, this is *his* version of Magickal Practice--with a strong resemblance to Witchcraft--yet, this work is not representative of Witchcraft, itself.<br />For the serious student, this work is very informative--combining Yoga Techniques with other Magickal Practices.
This Diatribe of Freemasonry is much more Humorous, than Kah's attempt at defacing the organization and \\"revealing\\" claims about the New World Order.  From the beginning, it is very difficult to take the book seriously.  The writer sounds like a delusional / paranoid \\"Conspiracy Theorist\\" and he takes-up many pages rambling about no one taking him seriously, and lamenting the fact that all the major talk shows dismissed him without response.  However, one bright spot in this, is we get to read the Other view of John J. Robinson's famous Interview with the author.  If you can get past the whining and  \\"poor me\\" syndrome, you will find the book becomes quite funny and entertaining.  I was giggling, ten minutes into the book.  Yet, despite the silly accusations and \\"out of context\\" quotations of Freemasonry books, combined with the very narrow-minded views of the author and his constant self-aggrandizement, this book does, in fact have great Value for Freemasons and Anti-Masons.<br />Anti-Masons, with limited perspectives, will love this book and feel vindicated.<br />Freemasons, will enjoy the concise lists of reading materials and the references to obscure Masonic books they may not have heard-of, before.  Also, this book is the only book I have read, so-far, that shows the fact that John J. Robinson became a 33rd degree Mason, for his wonderful, well-researched books.  I did not learn this, until I started hanging-out at The Shrine....but, here it is, in the Public Domain.<br />Personally, I believe Masons should read as many Anti-Masonic Books, as they read Masonic books.  Usually, they are quite silly and good for some great laughs and jokes--however, they also tend to have just-enough information to find a new book or two on the subject.  So far, the biggest \\"conspiracy\\" I have discovered is the competition to schedule a better fund-raiser than other Lodges:  Fish Fry, or Bean Supper.....  AHA!  Let's have a Chili Cook-off !<br />Masons, give this guy a chance.  Even if you can't take him seriously, he is much funnier than Kah and good for many knee-slappers.  Besides, this guy has created some pretty good lists of Masonic books, to read-even if he does take things out of context, when quoting.<br />The funny thing is, almost every Mason I know is a devout Christian.Even if you can't take him seriously, he is much funnier than Kah and good for many knee-slappers.

This book proves, to me, that most of what I have read about Crowley, previously, was filtered through the Lens of Prejudice.<br />I did not start reading Crowley's works, until recently, due to his reputation and the fact that I had read much negative information about him, from the time I was a child (my Grandfather owned &quot;An Index of Possibilities: Energy and Power,&quot; which I inherited). Most of my Opinions and Views of Crowley were created by reading the works of Colin Wilson, Nevill Drury, etc.<br />However, when I started reading Crowley's own words....I saw a different man. In fact, I can no longer believe the accusations of him being mentally unstable at the end of his life.<br />&quot;Magick Without Tears&quot; was written in the last years of Crowley's life, when other writers say A.C. was nuttier than a fruitcake. Yet, if you read this book, you will quickly realize he was completely Sound of Mind, Educated, Well-Spoken (or written, I should say) and quite Articulate. He obviously retained an enormous wealth of Knowledge in his own mind--only referencing books when necessary. There is no doubt that his mental faculties were still in Prime Condition. In fact, even his crankiness was tinted with a Humorous Quality that made him rather endearing. He writes the way the old guys I hang-out with Act....cranky, yet always suppressing a Mischievous grin playing on their lips &amp; their eyes dancing with boyish light.<br />Yes, he was a bit Eccentric...but, he seems to wish he had not been quite so Erratic--so that people would-have taken him a bit more seriously. His introversion was displaced by Forced Extroversion, leading him to act over the top many times when, perhaps, it would have been best for him to remain a Poet, instead of a &quot;Beast.&quot;<br />The Contents of &quot;Magick without Tears&quot; prove that the Contents of his mind were a Storehouse of Hidden Knowledge and highly sophisticated schooling--enough-so, to challenge any Professor.<br />The thing I find most Interesting and Amazing about this book is Crowley's Anthropological Insight into Humanity! I am a student of Anthropology and I never imagined I would find such a wealth of Anthropological Research in the works of Crowley--a man accused of being a Scoundrel and worse, by other writers.<br />I must say, I have seen more common-sense in the writings of Crowley, than I have in most of the Text books and religious books I have read. I think, perhaps, the reason he was so Ostracized is because he told the Blatant Truth about humanity and people's wishes, desires, behavior, et al.<br />The rest of Society wanted to sweep their &quot;faults&quot; under the carpet and hide them in the closet--but, Crowley wanted to be Honest and Celebrate these truly Human and NORMAL desires.<br />I believe someone should bestow an Honorary Anthropology Phd on Aleister Crowley. He makes more sense than most supposedly &quot;educated&quot; men on the subject of the Human Condition.<br />I could not put this book down--literally...I carried it around the house, reading whenever I got a chance. I strongly suggest this collection of Crowley's writings to anyone interested in the subjects of Crowley, Magick, Anthropology, Psychology, History or Religion.<br />This book taught me a lesson: &quot;Do your Own Research.&quot;<br />The thing I find most Interesting and Amazing about this book is Crowley's Anthropological Insight into Humanity!

Even if you never intend to read this book, buy it for the Beautiful Symbolism !  This little Book has absolutely Astounding, Full-Color Pictures--many of-which I have never seen, before.  The Book is worth owning for the picture of the RC Cross Apron, alone. However, the other Apron Photos are quite Fascinating. The Lodge pictures are beautiful.  Anyone with any interest in Freemasonry will treasure this book.  The Full-Color photos are amazing.  This book was written by a French Mason, so some of the content will be new to others--but, the rest is Universal.
This is without question the most Impressive book on the subject of The Qabalah, that I have encountered. Most books simply allude to Qabalistic knowledge and explain the devices used in the system; Gematria, Temura, Notariquon, etc.--but, 777 is a Compilation of decades of research, by a Dedicated Qabalist. I cannot possibly say I know enough about the Qabalah to give an educated review of 777, but, I do know this book contains more information, than any other book I have owned on the subject. It looks like a lifetime study, from what little I know--and, this seems to be the best place to start the Journey.<br />To learn the Paths and to see Illustrations of the Qabalah, I recommend studying the following book in conjunction with \\"777\\";  \\"Magick: Liber Aba: Book 4,\\" by Aleister Crowley (ISBN: 0877289190).  I have recently been studying this book, with great results.  A picture is worth a thousand words.  The labeled Diagrams truly help the Student understand the subject.<br />I also suggest purchasing a copy of \\"Paths of Wisdom,\\" by John Michael Greer (ASIN: 1567183158), if you can find a copy.  This book is especially useful to Students of the Mysteries, who have no teacher / organization.
&quot;The Law is For All&quot; was recommended to me, by an On-Line Friend.  I had read &quot;Then Book of The Law,&quot; Online, several times &amp; was not quite sure what to make of it.  I could not quite understand what the fuss was all about.  However, &quot;The Law is For All&quot; explained-away all those little things that had confused me or led me to believe that &quot;The Book of The Law&quot; was just Crowley's personal writings.  When I started looking into all this, I was a firm believer that Crowley was the man I had read about from Colin Wilson's perspective and Nevill Drury's perspective, etc.  In other words, my opinions were formed by the Research of others....  Yet, when I actually took the time to sit-down and read Crowley's works--well, I was amazed at his Genius and his Anthropological views of Humanity.  I never expected to gain Anthropology lessons from his works--but, he was truly an Observer of the Human Condition....all of which adds to this &quot;Commentary&quot; on the &quot;Book of The Law.&quot;<br />  What amazed me, until I realized that this book was written in the same way as all other &quot;Holy Books,&quot; was the fact that it is, in fact, a &quot;Holy Book.&quot;  This book was written in the same fashion as &quot;The Book of Mormon&quot; or any other &quot;Holy Book.&quot;<br />  Aliester Crowley served as The Prophet, and the book was written Through him (even if he was not exactly happy to be the Writer of the Work).<br />  &quot;The Law is For All&quot; has awakened me to the validity of certain religions that I had never really considered as such, previously.  I think this book is a good example of why we should ALL be respectful of each-other's religions and &quot;Holy Books,&quot; because they are ALL written in the exact same fashion.  Regardless of whether or not you agree with &quot;The Book of The Law,&quot; one cannot deny it is a &quot;Holy Book&quot; to many people.
Crowley sets his whimsical, humorous (notorious?) writing style aside, to take a deep, reverent look at The Tarot. This book contains more information about The Tarot and the Creation of The Tarot than numerous other books combined. This is not a \\"fluffy\\" book for amateurs, but a well-written and researched work connecting The Tarot with The Qabalah and Astrology.<br />If the tiny booklet in the Tarot package left you wanting, this is the book you desire to fulfill your hunger and thirst for more knowledge. I have been reading books about The Tarot for ten years and \\"The Book of Thoth\\" has quenched my thirst.<br />However, I also recommend purchasing \\"The Tarot Handbook: Practical Applications of Ancient Symbols,\\" by Angeles Arrien (\\"Tarot Symbols from a Psychological, Mythological, and Cross-Cultural Perspective\\").<br />\\"The Tarot Handbook....\\" by Arrien, uses Illustrations of \\"The Thoth Deck,\\" by Crowley and Lady Frieda Haris to explain the Jungian Psychology of the system, and gives a Helpful Overview of Interpreting the Thoth deck.<br />So-far, \\"The Thoth Deck\\" is the BEST deck I have ever found (I collect Numerous decks) aside from \\"The Ceremonial Magick Deck\\" (by Lon Duquette) & \\"The Masonic Tarot\\" (which is hard to find). Nearly every Serious Tarot User/Student I know uses The Thoth Deck, with wonderful & Accurate Results.<br />I do suggest, however, finding the Palm-sized Thoth deck, as opposed to the Oversized Deck--which is harder to manipulate. The cards work on a principle of Psychokenisis combined with Jungian Psychology. But, whatever works for you, personally.<br />\\"The Book of Thoth\\" is a great asset to any Tarot Library and a good place to start studying the System.  However, many people need to begin with a simple deck, such as Rider-Waite, before delving into the in-depth study of Crowley's works.
This Novel is a Journey through realization of what can happen when one Religious Power gains control of all-other religions and people, in this Technological Age. This is a Revelation of what our world could become, if Zealous \\"religious\\" people are in-control.<br />All those of \\"Alternative\\" faiths will enjoy this book & those of Dominant (Dominating) Faith's will despise this book. The Fifth Sacred Thing is definately a sacred book in the Pagan community. I honestly believe everyone should read this wonderful tale of the possible future.<br />For all those of Alternative Faith, this is a treasured story.<br />For all those of Zealous Adherence to Dogma, this book will be a burden and a curse to their thinking process and their plans of global domination.<br />The \\"Millennialists\\" are representative of a Religio-Political Force, dominating and subverting everything Pure: Earth, Fire, Air, Water & Spirit..... Stripping Humans of all the basic rights of life and forcing their views on the world, in a Nazi-like system of Control. However, a small community remains, removed from the destructive system of Corruption--separated by harsh lands and broken roads....and decades of Fear.<br />This wonderful Novel depicts the very believable scenario of a New Inquisition, in-which everyone must agree to the corrupt State Religion, or suffer and lose thier names, titles, professions and the right to have Water.<br />I highly recommend this book to all Thinking Individuals--depsite their religious preference. Starhawk has given the world a new Vision of the way things CAN be..... This is not a \\"Tree-Hugging Hippy\\" book. The characters are very well-written and you will grow to cherish them and hope the best for them, throughout their Journey. I felt for these characters more-so than any others I have read-about for many, many years.<br />The first ten pages gets off to a rough start, then the book smooths-out and becomes an engrossing tale that makes it very difficult to put the book down. Now, I want to know what happens to the characters and the World, AFTER the \\"Fifth Sacred Thing !\\"e book down. Now, I want to know what happens to the characters and the World, AFTER the \\"Fifth Sacred Thing !\\"
I recently began taking Ashtanga Yoga classes and I firmly believe, after only a few sessions, that Ashtanga Yoga is Very Beneficial to the Body and the mind.  After one session, your body begins to tighten-up.  After two sessions, you feel Great!<br />I am only a beginner, but I intend to pursue this form of Yoga for the rest of my life.  This form of Yoga makes you feel Wonderful and puts you in-tune with your body, very quickly.  However, it is rather Complicated &amp; this Instructional Book is Perfect for anyone involved in this practice.  In fact, one of the students in my class brought the book and the teacher used the pictures for demonstration purposes.  She is a Professional and she recommends this book.<br />The positions are all layed-out in-detail, via sketches and (mostly) Pictures.  This is an elegant book and it is Very Reasonably priced!<br />I would strongly suggest taking a few classes to begin and learn the techniques properly, but this book will help you immensely in your studies !  If you cannot afford classes or you live in a small town, this book, in combination with a quick Search of the Web, for &quot;Ashtanga Yoga&quot; will get you going (just make-sure to read all the safety issues and proper practices, first).
The major religions of the world must re-evaluate and re-investigate the legitimacy of the \\"Savior\\" Myth.  This book could, literally, change the world.  The concepts, premise &amp; information in this book is not-only a compilation of all the information The Church doesn't want you to know, but it is also a very well-written and honest approach to an age-old dilemma.<br />I began questioning the Validity of the Jesus Myth, at the age of 12.  I firmly and Honestly wanted to be \\"Saved and Baptized\\" at the age of 9, so I had a long talk on a Saturday afternoon, with our Baptist Preacher.  He realized I knew what I was talking about and we had a great conversation.  I was Baptized in June of '80.  However, by the age of 12, I realized (after much Bible Study and Observation), that the Jesus Myth wasn't all it's cracked-up to be.  I should have been in the Adult classes, but I was always told \\"that isn't how it works, you must wait until you are an Adult.\\"  Yet, I knew more than the Adults, so I studied on my own and lost all interest in Church.<br />I stopped going to church at age 16-unless Forced to attend.  I have only gone to churches for Weddings, during the last ten years, yet I have studied and read piles of books, during that time.  I knew that most of the Jesus Myth is a collection of PRE-Christian religions and Myths Grafted onto a man who may or may not have lived....<br />Yet, THIS BOOK made me believe in Jesus.<br />After 10 years of research, this is the only thing I have read, including the Bible, that made me believe Jesus actually existed and walked the earth.  I do not think many people could deny that he lived, after reading this Wonderfully Written book.<br />However, I must concur with one of the chapter titles:<br />&quot;The Truth will set you free....but, first, it may p--- you off.&quot;<br />\\"Saving The Savior\\" is the only book I have read that presents a substantial case for the existence of the man whose name has been (slandered) used to butcher millions of people.  After this book is on the market for a few years, there will be no more Inquisitions !  Fifty years ago, you would not have been allowed to read this book.  Buy it now, before the Thought Police pull a 451 on it.
Since discovering Yoga and it's benefits, I have begun the practice of Ashtanga Yoga, and I am also studying about Kriya and the \\"Self-Realization Foundation,\\" founded by Paramahansa Yogananda (\\"Mejda\\").  I devoured the book, \\"Mejda,\\" written by his brother & I am now devouring this book--his Autobiography.  I am so excited about this book that I could not even wait to finish it, before trying to get the word out!<br />If you are a person who is always striving to find Knowledge, or you are a Mystical person who is struggling to understand the World, the Mysteries or Spirituality, this book is calling your name.  I have always been fascinated by Deepak Chopra and men like him.  Paramahansa Yogananda's story helps me to understand these Great Men and their Message.<br />I cannot begin to explain how much I have enjoyed the story of Mejda's Journey and Spiritual Growth.<br />I am very seriously considering the idea of joining SRF, because of this book & his brother's book, \\"Mejda.\\"<br />I see, from searching, that Paramahansa Yogananda has written MANY books.  This makes me very happy.  I know the story will not end for a long time!
I cannot believe there is only One review for this Marvelous book!  I assumed this book would have a hundred reviews--so I never looked it up, until today.  Everyone is missing-out !<br />I discovered this book in '94, and I concurred with much of the material Sutphen penned in this Revelation of Self-Fulfillment.  I agreed, whole-heartedly, with his views of Relationships and the FACT that it is virtually Impossible for two people to live in a Monogamous situation, without ever &quot;experimenting&quot; on the side.  It doesn't happen.  Humans are Psychologically, Culturally, Religiously and Socially CONDITIONED and INDOCTRINATED to Believe that humans are supposed to be Monogamous....however, Statistics, Health Research and Common Sense reveal that Monogamy is a Myth.<br />Being a Writer, people Always Confide in me. Also, I study Anthropology and Psychology in the hopes of becoming an Anthropologist. I honestly believe that only 1% of the population is Truly Monogamous.  Everyone-else is lying.<br />This book Destroys the Myths and Social Silliness of unacceptance of &quot;Alternative&quot; Relationships.  Who says we cannot love 2 or 3 people, at-once ?  You love your Spouse, Children, Close Family and Close Friends......why-not 2 or 3 &quot;Lovers?&quot;  Sutphen explains the Myths that subjugate our minds into submission to Antiquated thinking about Relationships, and gives us a WONDEFUL concept to live-by......<br />&quot;You shouldn't let people 'should' on you.&quot;<br />To me, this was a Revelation !  I read his book 7 years ago and I accepted &quot;Radical Spirituallity&quot; in Concept and in Practice. However, I must admit, I was already open-minded about &quot;Open Relationships,&quot; before reading the book &amp; I had already been practicing this &quot;Radical&quot; theory for many years.<br />When you read Sutphen's reasoning about the concept of &quot;You shouldn't let people 'should' on you,&quot; it will become a Revelation to you, as well !<br />While reading this well-written, Exciting treatise on &quot;Radical Spirituallity,&quot; you will re-evaluate your Actions, Reactions and Views about Family life, Friends and everyone-else you communicate with.<br />How many times, per day (esp., from your parents--no-matter how old you are, or how-long you have been on your own), do you hear &quot;You Should....do this&quot; &amp; &quot;You Should....do that&quot; or &quot;You Shouldn't....do this / or that&quot; ?!  Think about it.  Why do you do most of the things you do? Conditioning &amp; Indoctrinization.<br />Buy this book and destroy the conditioning in your mind, so that you can be Free to Think and Act as you please.  This book will Free your Mind..... and you are Not obligated to Invite so-and-so to such-n-such Event, because someone says you &quot;Should!&quot;<br />&quot;Radical Spirituallity&quot; will Reveal to you the Path of Happiness.  Personally, the people who have always told ME, &quot;You Should&quot; are NOT Happy people...just people who exist and do what they &quot;should.&quot;<br />Acquire this book and get the word out ! &quot;Radical Spirituallity&quot;  is an Awakening.br />While reading this well-written, Exciting treatise on &quot;Radical Spirituallity,&quot; you will re-evaluate your Actions, Reactions and Views about Family life, Friends and everyone-else you communicate with.<br />How many times, per day (esp., from your parents--no-matter how old you are, or how-long you have been on your own), do you hear &quot;You Should....do this&quot; &amp; &quot;You Should....do that&quot; or &quot;You Shouldn't....do this / or that&quot; ?!

This is an Amazing volume of information, based-upon Anthropological &amp; Jungian interpretations of The Thoth deck.  If you love the Thoth Deck or you want to understand the underlying Symbolism of All Tarot cards, this book will be a great asset to your studies and to your collection!<br />I wish I would-have read this book several years ago, when I first acquired it.  However, a friend loved it so much that I gave it to her.  Luckily, we live-together, now--and she was more than happy to share.  Therefore, I had the opportunity to delve into this Fascinating work, researched by someone familiar with cross-cultural and psychological Symbolism.<br />There are so many levels of The Tarot &amp; so much Symbolism, that one can do hundreds of readings and not notice a certain aspect or Symbol of the Tarot Card that is calling-out to you.  Yet, this Splendid Handbook will give you absolutely astounding results!  If a certain Symbol or Image pops-out at you, more-so than the rest of the card, during one particular reading (or several subsequent readings) this well-written &amp; well-researched Tarot book will help you understand what the Cards are trying to tell you.  In my opinion, this Lady knows her stuff !<br />For those who do not understand how Tarot cards work, the System is based-upon Contacting Psychological Symbols and Archetypes in the subconscious mind--as-in Jungian Psychology.  The hands simply manipulate the information into revealing itself, through psychokenesis.  This means, basically, that your Subconscious Mind is trying to tell your Conscious (Incredulous &lt;g&gt; ) Mind certain information.  This is a great way to contact your Inner Emotions and Knowledge learned from the Higher Mind.<br />It is not necessary, however, to study Jungian Psychology and Quantum Physics to understand all this stuff.  Just grab a copy of this book and you will be set!  You will soon consider this book to be an Invaluable Resource for information and lessons in how to read your Tarot cards.  However, do not assume this book is ONLY representative of One deck.  Because this Symbolism pervades ALL Cultures, Religions, Myths, etc. it is Infused into MANY Tarot Decks--no-matter who created them, when or where in the world !  There are a few decks out there that are completely Individual works, made by people with personal agendas, or without respect for The Tarot &amp; this book will not help you with those decks--which are mostly just collector's items.<br />For most Standard Decks this &quot;Tarot Handbook&quot; will save you a lot of money and time researching (or scratching your head).<br />I believe that if a person purchases this book &amp; one deck (Thoth, preferably), they will begin to understand The Tarot very quickly.  I really cannot say enough good things about this work.  &quot;Practical Applications of Ancient Visual Symbols&quot; is a very descriptive and perfect title for this thick handbook, filled with a wealth of Knowledge, drawings and copies of the Thoth tarot cards, for easy reference.<br />I hate to sound cliche' but, she could have just as easily named this &quot;The Only Tarot Book You will Ever Need.&quot;read your Tarot cards.

I have worked with this deck on-and-off, for almost four years, and I must say that it gives very accurate results. I do not think it is a great Beginner's Deck (try Rider-Waite for that)--however, the woman who created this deck infused a wealth of information into the Artwork. Many people are leary of this Tarot deck, due to the fact that Crowley had a less than reputable persona. Yet, from all the research my Wiccan Wife has done, it seems Frieda Harris had a tremendous amount of influence in the project. I believe each person should judge for themselves. Some of the cards do, in fact, have a dark, brooding feeling to them, yet for some of these cards it is deservingly so. The Major Arcana are quite Beautiful and the Esoteric Symbolism worked into the Deck, throughout, is a Wealth of Knowledge. The placement of two Major Arcana cards are different than most standard decks, but comparable with a set of Egyptian Tarot Cards, from another Mystery school.<br />Previously, I was not willing to review Crowley's works, due to his reputation. However, I discovered that the reputations of the founders of an org. I learned-from were just as impugnable. I must give Crowely respect for at-least being Honest about his nature and not deceiving his students.<br />As with all things in life, it is best to investigate many different branches of this field of study, but I know that Most of the Tarot Readers I have met use The Thoth Deck more than any other deck in their collection. The Wonderful Artwork and Fascinating Symbolism give the Reader a vast-array of information to draw-from. My Wife is a locally renowned Tarot Reader and she swears by this deck, for accuracy....and, ALL of her friends swear by her Accuracy! &lt;She Never Charges for Readings...it is strictly from the Heart. I strongly advise against accepting readings from people who charge more than $15 for a reading &amp; I would never even Consider calling a Psychic Hotline....they just make Real Readers look bad. Buy a Deck, for yourself and teach yourself.&gt;<br />The Thoth Deck has some Great Companion Books, such as: &quot;The Tarot Handbook : Practical Applications of Ancient Visual Symbols&quot; -- by Angeles Arrien &lt;&amp;, of course, &quot;The Book of Thoth&quot; by Aleister Crowley, Frieda Harris (Illustrator)&gt;<br />I suggest buying the hand-sized Deck, because Large Decks are usually very cumbersome and it is hard to get a good psychokenetic feel for the cards. It is always best to have a deck that can be easily manipulated in the hands, for better accuracy in readings.<br />In my opinion, this deck is one of Crowley's greatest Contributions to those involved with The Mysteries.<br />I also strongly suggest studying Jungian Psychology, in conjunction with Tarot studies.<br />Thousands of people believe this is the best deck on the market.y a Deck, for yourself and teach yourself.&gt;<br />The Thoth Deck has some Great Companion Books, such as: &quot;The Tarot Handbook : Practical Applications of Ancient Visual Symbols&quot; -- by Angeles Arrien &lt;&amp;, of course, &quot;The Book of Thoth&quot; by Aleister Crowley, Frieda Harris (Illustrator)&gt;<br />I suggest buying the hand-sized Deck, because Large Decks are usually very cumbersome and it is hard to get a good psychokenetic feel for the cards.

This is a truly Wonderful Deck for the Beginner.  The Pictures are full of colorful Symbolism (I have taken Tarot classes based-upon studying the Symbolism of these &quot;simple&quot;-looking cards). The images are perfectly acceptable for teaching Children the use of/or stories of The Tarot.  In fact, they almost seem to be created with a child-like Happy view of the world, set in fairy-tale history.  The Advanced Tarot Reader will not be so impressed with this deck, yet each person must begin somewhere on the Royal Path. Personally, I believe this is a great first stepping-stone on the path of enlightenment.  Even thoroughly Indoctrinated Christians will not find too much to worry about in these beautiful cards.  This is a great way to start your Mystical Journey!
A.E. Waite is a well-respected author in the study of The Mysteries.  However, this book is not his best work. To be honest, I never could bring myself to do more than read sections of this book.  I coul dnever read it straight-through.  However, given the system of Tarot, flip-throughs are usually all you need, to discover what you need to know.  There are many better books on the the subject of How to Study The Tarot, but this is a good Beginner's lesson.  So many people try to make the Study of Tarot a &quot;cut &amp; dry&quot; issue (i.e., &quot;this is the way it is....&quot;)--however, in actuality, it is a life-long process of Study, Experiment, and Collection of Knowledge.  It is best to read books by Many authors of Many perspectives and study Jungian Psychology, as well.  Consider this book a &quot;first stepping-stone on the Path of Enlightenment.&quot;
This Set gets one more * than the Rider Deck, because this one comes with a book.  A. E. Waite is well-respected in the study of The Mysteries!<br />This is a truly Wonderful Deck for the Beginner. The Pictures are full of colorful Symbolism (I have taken Tarot classes based-upon studying the Symbolism of these &quot;simple&quot;-looking cards).

This is an amazing piece of Ingenuity! Normally, I would give this deck a slightly lower rating (***), however it receives an extra * for being Easily Transportable &amp; Easily palmed to prevent Zealous eyes from wondering what you are doing.  If you live in The Bible Belt, this deck is your best friend!  Women find this deck a great asset to keep in their purse &amp; it is Perfect for pocket-carrying by men.  The hard, plastic case prevents the deck from being jostled into oblivion &amp; snaps-shut, tightly.  This would probably also be a good key-chain item. The first few times I saw this deck, I thought it was &quot;cute&quot; and laughed it off as an &quot;interesting&quot; nick-nack.  However, when I finally gave-in to the urge to check it out, I discovered that it is Surprisingly Usable !  I assumed it would be difficult to manipulate and work-with--yet, I was mistaken.  It is Easy to use and just as Accurate as any other deck! I honestly believe All Tarot Readers would enjoy this Deck....if for no other reason than the fact that it will probably become a Collector's Item !
I purchased a paperback copy of this book in 1990, and I have owned it &amp; Loaned it, ever-since.  I just wrote a review for a Sylvia Browne book, mentioning how Valuable David St. Clair's book truly is !  However....now, I see it is &quot;out of print.&quot; How very Sad.<br />I learned to Astral Travel, by reading this book, before joining an organization with very expensive books and tests and fancy certificates.....  The only thing about the teachings of the org. that was more explanatory of &quot;Astral Travel,&quot; was the fact that it also taught the Mechanics of it all (Physics).  However, you can get that information, easily, from Deepak Chopra's &quot;Journey to The Boundless&quot; and his other works.  So, SAVE Yourself some Money and buy David St. Clair's Lessons in Easy ESP and some of Deepak's Tape-sets.<br />You will save Tons of money and have Wonderful Results.  Organizations will try to inform you that you must do all this in a very complicated manner, with a lot of superfluous rigamarole....but, let's face Reality :  You do this, Every Night, when you go to sleep &amp; Org.s want your hard-earned Cash!<br />If you own this book, you will value it, treasure it &amp; loan it to all your friends in the field of interest.  In fact, my copy is on-loan, right now!<br />I just cannot comprehend WHY this book is &quot;out of print!!!&quot;  As many others have said, THIS book WORKS !

First, I must thank my friend, Stacie H., for recommending this book to me, about a year ago. (See my Profile Page for Her great reviews of Sylvia Browne books).  I thought, for a long time, that these books would not measure-up to the previous books I have read, concerning the Afterlife and the Physics involved with Life after Death.  I have been studying this sort of thing for a very long time and I have been Psychic, since Birth. I have read Tarot Cards for ten years and I have been seeing Ghosts all my life.  I learned to Astral Travel, from a book called &quot;Instant ESP,&quot; also ten years ago.  Therefore, I feel I should give THIS (Sylvia) book a nod, with Respect !<br />Even after studying piles and piles of thick &quot;egghead&quot; books and books that correlate Travel on the Other Side with Physics, I truly believe that Sylvia has expressed the basic concepts and Truth of The Afterlife, in a Concise, Easy to Read, Easy to Digest format !  One need-not sit down with a pile of occult texts and Quantum Physics books to understand Why and How it all works, when Sylvia gives a very good Synopsis of the Basic Concepts.  However, listening to Deepak Chopra's tapes, such as &quot;Journey to The Boundless&quot; is a Great way to understand HOW all the things Sylvia talks about are possible (and Scientific) !<br />I find her description of The Afterlife / Astral World to be written much the same way a person would Describe ALL of Europe, after Only Traveling to France--but, aside from this very structured description, from a singular viewpoint, it still stands to Truth.  However, I honestly believe not Everyone will see things Exactly the same way, or go through the Exact same proceedure upon Crossing-over.  Yet, for beginners and people of All Faiths, this is a GREAT Introduction to the Afterlife, in a more Common-Sense approach, than we are taught in church.  I absolutely LOVE her explanation of the Reality of Heaven, vs. the things we are Indoctrinated to believe about Heaven !!!<br />I found my favorite new quote, in this book, as well--when I read Sylvia's opinions about Humans NOT needing a &quot;message carrier&quot; to moderate with God for us !!!  (Amen).  No one needs a &quot;go-between&quot; to carry messages to God.  One only needs to speak Directly to The Big Guy/Gal, on a personal level.  Priests need-not apply.  I am very, very happy to see someone admitting the Truth--esp., after being Indoctrinated with a certain belief system that Stresses the Necessity of having a moderator Dividing us from God and Interpreting for us.  Bravo !  She should get ten stars, for being so bold as to speak the Truth.<br />I honestly believe she was writing from the Heart, in many instances. In fact, during my own Psychic Investigations, I have always noted that when something about Ghosts / Hauntings is True, I get a certain series of Chills, Gooseflesh, etc. in my body and it feels as-if someone passes through me.  As I read a Touching story in this book, that Truth Test happenend to me!<br />So, as far as I am concerned, this book receives the Psychic Seal of Approval (but, I don't have any fancy Certificates to prove it--just 30 years of Real-Life Experience).<br />I strongly recommend people of All Faiths to read this book. This is a Wonderful Starting Point, for a Journey into the Mysteries of Life After Death !  Well-Done!ieve about Heaven !!!<br />I found my favorite new quote, in this book, as well--when I read Sylvia's opinions about Humans NOT needing a &quot;message carrier&quot; to moderate with God for us !!!

As I read a Touching story in this book, that Truth Test happenend to me!<br />So, as far as I am concerned, this book receives the Psychic Seal of Approval (but, I don't have any fancy Certificates to prove it--just 30 years of Real-Life Experience).<br />I strongly recommend people of All Faiths to read this book. This is a Wonderful Starting Point, for a Journey into the Mysteries of Life After Death !  Well-Done!
I found this book to be very Enlightening, due to the fact that I have always been taught that Yoga and &quot;Eastern Philosophy&quot; are Negative in nature, in the Spiritual sense.  However, I have always Admired great men like Gandhi and Deepak Chopra.<br />I have felt, for a long while, a strong desire to understand the Philosophy of Gandhi &amp; Deepak Chopra.  Recently, the opportunity arose for me to begin practicing Yoga &amp; work my way up to Kriya.  So, as with all things, I wanted to read back-ground information.  The wonderful Kriya gentleman I met sent me this book and I devoured it in two days--despite all the foreign words and names, which I wanted to ingest fully and not skim-over.  This gentleman also strongly recommended &quot;Autobiography of a Yogi,&quot; by Paramahansa Yogananda--which I have ordered from Amazon.com.<br />I am anxiously awaiting the arrival of &quot;Autobiography.....&quot; because this story Captivated me!  I felt very in-tune with the young &quot;Mejda&quot; who evolved into a great Yogi, who spread the Light of Yoga teachings to the West.<br />I know, from studying occult works, that Yoga &amp; Eastern Philosophy was not always well-accepted in America.  However, &quot;Mejda&quot; did a wonderful job of Educating Americans and set-up 70 Yoga centers in the world.  He must have been an Amazing man.<br />I am very-much looking forward to my journey in Yoga &amp; I strongly recommend these books to anyone involved with Yoga &amp; Eastern thought.  I am beginning to understand Hinduism.<br />This book is very well-written and you will find yourself glued to it.  My eyes were riveted to the pages, until I finished reading the last page.<br />I am ever-indebted to the gentleman who sent me this book, for opening my eyes to the Wisdom of Yoga.  I recently discovered that the West's early antagonism against Yoga came strictly from personal animosity against people like Mdme. Blavatsky, by other organizations.  I have concluded that the Negative attitudes toward Yoga and Eastern thought, by Westeners is due to Ignorance of the truth--not any valid argument against the system of thought.<br />Make sure you buy the Autobiography, because this story is one you will not want to end !the Negative attitudes toward Yoga and Eastern thought, by Westeners is due to Ignorance of the truth--not any valid argument against the system of thought.<br />Make sure you buy the Autobiography, because this story is one you will not want to end !
George Washington layed the Cornerstone of The White House in &quot;Full Masonic Regalia&quot; and I have found various illustrations of our Founding Father, in his Regalia, surrounded with Masonic Symbolism, but this book contains more, including the story! I have known that America was founded upon Masonic Principles for a very long time, but this is the first book I have seen, in the public domain, that tells much of story.  Also, there are many Illustrations, Full Color Photos and informative Masonic revelations in this book that I have not seen, before. I cannot claim that the Astrological information was new to me...but, I have been studying Astrology and reading Masonic texts for ten years. Anyone with a smidgeon of interest in Masonry knows that America was founded upon these Principles and the ideas of Great Men, such as John Locke..... However, most people do not realize that America is Founded upon Masonry, to the extent that it pervades the Architecture--not-only of Washington, D.C.--of our Nation. Public buildings all-over Louisville, KY and the surrounding area (including small towns in Indiana) are adorned with Masonic Symbolism. Masonic Symbolism is built into the Stonework of most of the Courthouses and other public buildings, including churches. A small town, in Indiana, even has Masonic Templar Symbolism built into the stained-glass windows. For an interesting journey, take a Carriage ride around Louisville, KY (and check-out the Symbolism on the &quot;2nd street bridge,&quot; then cross-over to Jeffersonville, IN and take a good look at the old Masonic Lodge!). It's not just D.C. Folks...it's the whole country.  However, this fine book explores the wonders of our Nation's Capitol and gives us beautiful pictures of our &quot;hidden&quot; history. Nearly every Mason will want this book, because it has a photo of Albert Pike's Grave Site and lots of Masonic Symbolism, plus one beautiful, full-color Masonic Jewel !<br />Also, High-Degree Masons are building a &quot;Masonic Museum&quot; to showcase their contribution to History and Society, which will prove this book is a wonderful addition to your collection. Buy it now, in Hardback, because this ones will be a Collector's Item, soon.....building a &quot;Masonic Museum&quot; to showcase their contribution to History and Society, which will prove this book is a wonderful addition to your collection.

********** &quot;The Secret Teachings of All Ages&quot; is, without question, the most wonderful book I have ever owned! I spent hours slowly turning the pages and looking at the Very Well- Produced Artwork!!! You will be amazed, when you first open the book. The printing is also very stylish and sets-off the Mystical nature of the very large &lt;this is a &quot;reduced&quot; size?!&gt; compendium of knowledge. I have been studying Masonic &amp; Hermetic Philosophy, Psychology, Anthropology, Astrology, etc. for the last ten years....and this book just left my jaw hanging, in wonder and rapture. You will see what appears to be originals of many &quot;occult&quot; images that permeate the mass-market. This is high-quality art that begs to be placed on even the wealthiest person's coffee-table. Even if you only purchase this book for it's superb artwork and Masonic / Hermetic / Kabalistic illustrations, pictures/paintings &amp; Alchemical drawings, you will not be disappointed!!! I recommend this book to people who do not like to read and to those who Love to Read! Either way, you cannot lose. I am particularly interested in the &quot;man with four faces,&quot; because of a Vision I had in 1991.... Looks like I am not the only person to ever draw The Conundrum.<br />You will be enthralled with the Artistic Quality of this massive book and you will treasure it's contents forever. This is an absolute &quot;must-have&quot; for all Students of &quot;The Secret Teachings of All Ages!&quot;
This is one of those rare litle gems that stir the Imagination and make you want to delve into a hypothesis, whether you believe it is true or false.  Regardless of the verity of the subject matter of this thin pocket-guide to Adventure in the Languedoc region of France, it does inspire the reader to investigate various interconnecting links and historical works in search of more data to form an opinion about the theories discussed in the heavily illustrated pages. I read the book in '98 and thought it was interesting, but could not quite let myself believe it was accurate. However, after reading a pile of Masonic books and a pile of mass-market stuff--referring to this region--I am convinced there is Something Strange, indeed, about Rennes-le-Chateau and the Languedoc.<br />I almost reviewed this book last year, but I waited until I read a lot of other material, first. I own &quot;Holy Blood: Holy Grail,&quot; but I have not read it, yet &amp; I have not read Henry Lincoln's other works, so most of my interest comes from connections with other historical events and books like &quot;Dungeon, Fire and Sword,&quot; by John J. Robinson.<br />I do believe this book details a very strong case for a Geometrical Conundrum, in this mountain region and the surrounding area, and there seems to be a strong desire to &quot;reveal&quot; the existence of a conspiracy surrounding the region, church, etc.  Taken alone and with mass-market material, this book seems to be far-fetched, yet when compared with certain less-known works and the symbolism of Secret Societies....well, it appears to be quite valid--especially, when you consider important admonitions from Masonic Lore, such as: &quot;Alter-not the Ancient Landmarks.&quot;<br />Perhaps, this little book is just a brain teaser, suggesting that people &quot;dig deeper&quot; &amp; decide for themselves what is the Truth?
The Masonic Tarot Surpasses all the decks I own, with the exception of The A.C. Thoth Deck. I have used The Masonic Tarot, daily & I thank my fianc&eacute; for buying them for me, before they went out of print. These cards are still available, but they are hard to acquire. They are worth all of the effort and every penny spent! You will Treasure these cards, forever.  I have been using The Tarot for ten years and I consider The Masonic Tarot to be the Pinnacle of my collection.<br />If you would like a preview, send me an email.
The History of Freemasonry is clouded with time, personal prejudice, suppression and many other factors. Yet, men like Mackey lay the paver-stones for the path of self-discovery amongst Masons. He gave many years of his life to this research and the book is well-worth every year he spent in dusty libraries, to produce this work. The beginnings of this book contain very archaic language, but the struggle is worth the time given to study. It seems that most books are a variation of this material, or refer to this material. Whether it is &quot;the definitive history of Freemasonry,&quot; or not, is up to debate.... However, it is hard to appreciate NEW findings, without refering to books such as this one, to understand how much of the mass-market material is &quot;accurate&quot; or, at-least, Inspired-by well-documented research. I would expect to see this one on every Mason's bookshelf, but Anyone can appreciate the complex &quot;History of Freemasonry.&quot;
This book is an astounding collection of Masonic and other Secret Society information. Do not let other reviews deter you from purchasing this tome! I have owned this book for over one year and every time I see something in another Masonic work that I am unsure-of, I can find a reference to the material in Waite's Encyclopaedia. The only reason people think it is too archaic is because people do not read enough. This book is a must-have for any researcher in the field of Masonry and/or other Secret Societies, including the H.B. of L. I appreciate this work, almost daily. If you can't read this one, forget &quot;The History of Freemasonry,&quot; by Albert Mackey. This is a wonderful research book, despite the fact that it needs a thorough index, for quick-reference. I would be willing to Index this work, because of it's value to all Masons and other researchers in the field. I cannot begin to describe how amazed I was, when I cracked the covers of this book for the first time....and the thrill continues, each time I take it off the shelf!
No more veiled allusions to a Deeper Meaning of Masonry. No more Hints and Insinuations. No more references to obscure books, that can only be found through unfamiliar publishers. No more &quot;I know more than you, but I cannot tell you about it.&quot; No more pre-1717 cover-up. Here it is: everything you ever wanted to know about Masonry, but were afraid to ask.... Or, wanted to ask--but, couldn't get anyone to talk about it. This is the book you have been Searching for &amp; the book that will revitalize The Craft.  Wilmshurst tells it like it is, after giving many Lectures amongst Masons of the world. He offers us some Gold, instead-of a Treasure Map. If all the other Masonic books left you feeling unsatiated and thirsty for more Knowledge, this book will quench your thirst and provide ample revitalization in the future. Wilmshurst believes a man should enter The Craft with no blinders or misgivings about his Work. He believes in offering the Truths he has discovered to all those seeking The Light.  Anyone contemplating the idea of petitioning The Lodge should read this book...and, everyone within The Lodge should give Wilmshurst's message a respectful perusal during a quiet afternoon.
Dafoe has done it, again! This compilation of Fraternal poetry will be a great asset to any Masonic library. Wonderful coffee-table book and reference material. My sister gave me this book for Christmas and I finished reading it in one sitting! I was especially happy with &quot;The Mother-Lodge,&quot; by Bro. Rudyard Kipling. I have always had a deep love for Poetry and I found this book to be very Inspirational! I sincerely hope Dafoe has more great books to offer us, in the future. Wonderful Collection of Verse.... Any chance of a Volume II hitting the shelves, soon?  I always recommend this book to New Brothers or other individuals requesting a list of books about Masonry, because they have decided to Petition The Lodge.
I have spent ten years researching Freemasonry. My library is packed with Masonic and Anti-Masonic books. The most Succinct review of this book, in my opinion, is this:  &quot;Dogmatic Drivel.&quot;<br />If Ignorance is Bliss, this book is Utopia....  However, it IS a great book for understanding Anti-Masonry and the perpetuation of Ignorance--esp., because of religious Prejudice and Silliness.<br />All of my research has led me to one conclusion about Freemasonry:  I want to Join the Honorable Order...(and I will soon become a Mason, officially).<br />Many Blessings Upon The Lodges of The World.  -- GDL
Intrinsically woven into the fabric of time, is a hidden school of thought. Principles of heretical, hidden knowledge, coded into the Philosopher's library of secret works. Gematria, Temura, Notariquon. Veiled allusions, deciphered by man. Intricate conspiracy of Rosicrucian branches of the Tree of Illumination.  Infatuation with symbolic overtures of hidden music.  Initiation into a world of spiritual exclusiveness and egotistical adherence to a scientific, structural revelation of the mind of Deity. Illusive logic. Can the mind of man know the mind of God?  Can a computer break the code and reveal all the secrets of the secret schools?  Are The Templars trying to stop the Revelation? What is The Password?  I cannot reveal the structure of the story, because They are coming for m alfk;lhag'[`ppjjjjjjj
This Investigation into the cloudy history of Freemasonry and the Origins of The Shroud of Turin is so well-conceived, written, explained and researched that I am amazed the general public has access to the material.  Normally, I tend to write flippant, funny reviews.... However, \\"The Second Messiah\\" is such a truly illuminating book that I feel compelled to tone it down, considerably. Reverence? Perhaps.  I have been dropping hints here and there, in other reviews, but would not specifically back certain theories ---e.g., the concept of the Shroud being painted by Leonardo da Vinci (\\"The Templar Revelation,\\" by Picknett &amp; Prince)....great read, but not plausible.  My grandfather owned two volumes called: \\"The Complete Works of Leonardo da Vinci\\" (fully Illustrated, with notes made by Leonardo).  Somehow, after growing up with those books, I don't think the Leonardo theory jives.  This work, by Knight and Lomas, however, is based on terrific research and is based on a real-world hypothesis.  It seems, to me, after studying everything I can get my hands on about Masonry, that Knight and Lomas know more than they let-on....or, have been extremely \\"lucky\\" with their insights, informants and book discoveries, but that makes it even more interesting to me.  I keep wondering what the Next book will reveal !  This one Reveals quite a lot.....in fact, I doubt it could-have been published ten years ago.  I feel that the Masons must be ready to join the Information Age, or Knight and Lomas would not have gotten this book printed.  They have done a wonderful job and everything makes sense.  There are no Loopy Theories or silly proposals, based on illusive myths.  I believe they are onto something and that something is quite possibly The Truth.
Grab your favorite towel and stick your pet Goldfish in your ear, boys 'n girls...it's time to jump on the Mothership and take a tour of The Universe. Besides, your house is going to be bull-dozed into the ground, anway. Why stick-around to watch? Just press the magick button and beam yourself up to the ultimate joyride through space...the final frontier...of lunacy. If Earth just isn't nutty-enough for you, anymore, escape to exotic locations in the heavens where all bets are off and robots have feelings, too. If your Earth friends aren't weird-enough, make new friends on Planets far-away. Have a wonderful journey....but, don't lose your towel! This is the series of books that spawned thousands of interesting sayings, book titles and references that only the Initiated comprehend. Understand the secret language of eggheads...and open new worlds of conversation. If you are confused in the breakroom, this series will reveal the ludicrous statements your coworkers are so casually tossing-about. Douglas Adams is a master of comical, fun-loving adventure and wordplay.  Truly, he has been an inspiration to many, many people. Relax with the Hitch Hiker's Guide and go to sleep giggling....but, don't forget to take the fish out of your ear.
Journey with Stile, in a world of High-Tech--Juxtaposed with a Realm of Fantasy and Magick. Experience a world in-which you are not allowed to wear clothing (unless absolutely necessary), if you are not among the Elite...and a piece of Lingerie is a treasure to be kept safe, like gold or diamonds in our own world. Our hero is a man of Sports and a contender not-only in games and Olympic feats, but of quests in magickal lands... trying to survive assassination on both planes of existence! Even crossing-over is a danger to his life. This is very adventurous reading, with Sci-Fi &amp; Fantasy...Futuristic, High-Tech &amp; Magickal, Low-Tech scenarios...combined in a flowing epic of self-discovery and Mastership. You may have noticed, that I did not review the first book of the series (&quot;SPLIT INFINITY&quot;) and opted for &quot;BLUE ADEPT,&quot; instead.... Well, the cover of this book attracted me to the series (Glad it hasn't changed :) --So, I went with my...instincts...on this issue.  Anyway, all the books are great! Make sure you don't forget &quot;JUXTAPOSITION,&quot; or you will be left hangin' until you receive the next purchase. I loved the series and I suggest searching for all of Piers Anthony's novels....  This is a guy you can't go wrong with.  So, there you have it--Introductory Course: How to Live in 2 Worlds, Simultaneously!
The Xanth series is a collection of Tongue-in-Cheek adventurous wanderings through a world where word-play is reality and reality is like a Dream World, from-which you cannot awake--yet, the stories are fantasy episodes comparable to the other great works of the genre, by your favorite Fantasy Writers...only, with a comedic twist and a perfectly placed punch-line (which, in his world, would probably be a running of the gauntlet, with burly men throwing wild swings at your head) now and then! Piers Anthony is a master of word usage and placement--just look at his other titles, even the book names he comes up with make you curious to see what's inside the artistic covers of his stories. &quot;A Spell for Chameleon&quot; is the place to embark upon the tour through Anthony's strange and exciting universe-- but, when the tour of Xanth is over, go visit the world of &quot;The Blue Adept.&quot; Piers Anthony is a wonderful writer and one of the men who helped me survive High School. After reading some intense Terry Brooks, I'd kick-back with some Xanth novels and relax a little. I very-much recommend the &quot;THE APPRENTICE ADEPT&quot; series, which is unlike anything you have probably read, before.... You will thoroughly enjoy Stile's adventures and his attempts to live in Two Worlds, simultaneously.
I came-across this series at the age of eighteen and purchased the entire set, thinking that it would be a good way to spend the winter months.  However, although it was still warm and beautiful outside, I became caught-up in the magickal journey and spent the next week and a half devouring the series! At the time, I was an avid fisherman and spent almost every free moment traversing the countryside fishing, wade-fishing, hiking and spelunking....  Yet, the books called to me and I found myself holed-up in my room day after day, instead. The day I finished the series, I realized the journey was over and I couldn't believe I had read the books so quickly! This required another trip to the bookstore, to stock-up for the cold months.  There are many things in Eddings' books that you will not find in other fantasy worlds...like this Monk-like character, who walks through solid rock...with detailed descriptions of the process. I feel compelled to give this guy a plug, because his name just doesn't pop-up enough, in the genre. Eddings is well-worth giving a try, despite his lack of recognition.
Ellenroh searches for her heritage and her Race, in a world of madness, constantly under attack from forces that wish to rip her apart. This one will make your teeth clench, as you travel with her, on the journey to reclaim her people--lost to the world of mankind. There are many surprises in this book, things that you would not expect, but will draw you deeper into the story. I would love to mention a few things...but, I don't want to give them away. I deeply respect and admire Terry Brooks, a man who dissed a career in Law to take-up a quill and parchment.  His writing is very enticing...his words draw you into the story, and you cannot escape his world. Tolkien got me through Middle school and Terry Brooks helped me survive High School, although I must admit I read Tolkien again and again--however, Terry Brooks is the only author I feel that I can mention beside the name of the master. This novel is not a &quot;Lord of The Rings&quot; nock-off, it is completely original.  If you are looking for copy-cat stories, you should look else-where--although, the series does contain some of the same creatures and humanoids (sort-of), they are very original and exciting. I agree with the Future scenario, because of certain buildings and such that are encountered during the journey....our world devastated and rebuilt with Magick. One aspect of Brook's series that I feel very attracted to is the character Allanon, a Druid that sleeps for centuries or decades and awakens when he is needed. I have always felt a strong connection with this character....  Interestingly, this mysterious character guards a secret Storehouse of Knowledge and strives to save humankind from the Demonic Forces that want the world to live in Ignorance and Despair.
When I read this one, back in High School, I was so completely enthralled that I could not stop reading--despite other responsibilities. The journey of Wil Ohmsford, as he guards the Elven girl Amberle, while being pursued by the ultimate Demon... and trying to prevent a tear in the magickal fortifications that keep the Demon Forces on the OTHER side...is hair-raising adventure!  You will pray that they make it through, and accomplish their goals.  This one proves certain fanatics wrong--fantasy is not inspired by the dark forces--in fact, it proves that faith is necessary in attempting to over-come Darkness.

The shade of Allanon requests a gathering of the few people in the world that can attempt to prevent certain destruction of all that is known. He reveals the Future...and it is Darkness. Only a tiny band of beings can bring The Light to humankind...before all is lost. They must bring salvation to the masses, or see the end of civilization. Only the last of the Druids can help save the world...with help from a band of chosen ones.

I suppose this means that my copy is a Collector's Item, now. Sigh....why are all of my favorites out of print? I wanted to do a review for the Thieves' World (Sanctuary) series, only to find them &quot;out of print.&quot; I thought, &quot;well, Marion Zimmer Bradley is a LEGEND....I'll review 'Lythande,' instead.&quot; I'm glad I take such excellent care of my books and refuse to loan them out to anyone I do not have a meaningful connection with.... I'll be saving my copy of Lythande for my future daughter, Melita Renae Lincoln. This makes me realize how important my little library is! Well...if you can acquire this compilation of stories about Lythande (Lee-THOND), you will be captivated by this character, who was born in a world that has been nearly forgotten, and was created by a woman who will not ever be forgotten. This one is not your typical hack 'n slash, Mazes 'n Monsters fare....in fact, the stories are intellectually stimulating and carry underlying layers of the writer's sentiments. Marion Zimmer Bradley also editorializes a bit, expressing her personal views about Feminism, Male Weirdness and such. As I said, I'm saving this one for my future daughter.
Allanon, the keeper of the Keep (and all the Sacred Knowledge), returns from death to prevent yet-another attack of the insidious forces that always strive to destroy the Light. This novel is more true-to-life, than most fantasy novels, because the characters have serious obstacles to overcome that are not necessarily related to problems outside of themselves...they are a company of people suffering from various personal injuries and issues that make the main quest all that much more difficult. These are real heroes, that cannot simply stave-off an attack like it was nothing to them (like most fantasy writers portray the main characters) these are not super-heroes...they are ordinary people who strive to rise-above the challenges and escape the dangers at every turn.

The plot thickens...now, our man Holiday must rely on his incompetant Wizard to save him and his wilting willow woman.... oh, and the dogman that they went to save, before they had to be saved, because the Wizard sneezed.  What? It's Great! Take a break from reality, with this lovely piece of escapism. Don't forget to come back, though...or, we'll send Questor Thews after you!
Ahh...at-last.... We reach The Keep. Journey to the hidden storehouse of knowledge, protected by the Druids. Allanon risks all in this episode of the series! You will sit on the edge of your seat, as Allanon and company attempt to enter the last refuge of hope for the enlightenment of humankind (and otherkind). Read &quot;The Sword&quot; &amp; &quot;The Elfstones,&quot; first...then, kick-back with this one on a cold, Winter day. Writing these reviews convinces me that it is time to re-enter Brook's world, once-more. I deeply respect and admire Terry Brooks, a man who dissed a career in Law to take-up a quill and parchment.

After reading the Shannara series, you may need a little comic relief. &quot;Magic Kingdom For Sale&quot; has the same great writing style, but less Intensity....you won't feel so nervous about the main characters and the quest is more like your own life--how the heck am I going to straighten this mess out? What did I get myself into? --except for the fact that your friends are not quite human and your world is completely new...and you have more responsibility than you ever imagined, just when you thought you were FINALLY going to get a break...and then this Dark Lord character wants to take-over everything and.... Oh, read the story!  This series is more at-home on the shelf beside &quot;The Hitch-hiker's Guide,&quot; than the Shannara series.  You'll love it!
Our man, Ben Holiday, ruler of a magickal kingdom, finds even more problems to solve in his new world...like, for instance, staying alive. The novel begins at breakfast, with a dream and escalates from there....entangled with more twists and turns than a roller-coaster, so hang-loose and enjoy the ride. I like the girl who turns into a tree. After reading the Shannara series, you may need a little comic relief. &quot;Magic Kingdom For Sale&quot; has the same great writing style, but less Intensity.... you won't feel so nervous about the main characters and the quest is more like your own life--how the heck am I going to straighten this mess out? What did I get myself into? --except for the fact that your friends are not quite human and your world is completely new...and you have more responsibility than you ever imagined, just when you thought you were FINALLY going to get a break...and then this Dark Lord character wants to take-over everything and....

Deepak Chopra and Wayne Dyer are inspirational! These great men have combined their thoughts and views about Spirituality and hidden knowledge, backed with decades of research, into a Healing, Informative presentation that will make you understand the quantum mechanics behind our thoughts, bodies and Soul. For those who have never delved into the mysteries, or those who think our lives are not magickal, this series is a revelation! These men are very well-educated and they believe in sharing the methods of Healing that they have discovered....mostly, relating to a person's mind-set and BELIEF in God, self and Healing Power. Doctors of the future may be in for a complete restructuring of their own beliefs, after this work gets-around for a few decades! Be on the ground floor of scientific revolution, check these guys out....and Listen to their ideas.  You might just find yourself acquiring more Energy, wealth and Health. I usually would not ever recommend &quot;self-help&quot; tapes, because most of the stuff on the market is goofy or geared towards capitalism and propaganda. However, Deepak Chopra and Wayne Dyer are Genuine individuals, with a strong desire to raise the consciousness of humankind and explore the reality of our Inner Nature. The stories they tell, to help people relate to their ideas, are welcome words for the whole family. Children do not know they are incapable of great things, until they are Programmed to believe this untruth....  Personally, I have always been a &quot;Scurvy Elephant,&quot; myself.
Tolkien is a Legend, that thousands of authors have striven to be compared with--yet, none have accomplished the task of out-doing his work. Tolkien is the master and creator of the genre...and the way interest in education is dropping, his position appears to be permanent and unchallengeable.  However, many people do not know about this book of translations, by Prof. Tolkien. You can refer to my reviews of the Hobbit and The Trilogy, for more info about his teaching positions and language skills. My copy of this book is yellow, with age, but the book is still as beautiful inside, as it is on the outside. If you love Poetry, or stories of Knights, Romance and Chivalry...or Holy Quests...you'll love this book.  If your Tolkien fan does not have this one on the shelf, their collection is incomplete.
I also read this one in High School....  Didn't we all?  Job IS a comedy of justice.  I remember reading this one in rapture. The words flowed into my cranium, like soothing balm. I'll never forget the Tent Revival scene....it made all the real tent revivals I went to, as a child, worthwhile.  Like all men who &quot;ask too many questions,&quot; The Big Guy puts the smack-down on our man Job...leading to all kinds of weird adventures. Warning: Previous drug users may have falsh-backs, while reading this book, it's a real Trip. Of course, it is very well-written... it's Heinlein! This novel does not probe as deeply into the human condition as &quot;Stranger in a Strange Land&quot; (Heinlein), but it is a funny journey full of many twists and surprises, with an irreverence that most people could not handle at the time it was written.  This book is a perfect gift for your favorite egghead or fantasy buff.  Writing about the novel makes me want to read it again!
Grok the Fullness of Understanding--Explore your Mind....with this Epic Tome of Literary Achievement! This book has inspired millions of minor philosophers and armchair psychologists, anthropologists and other trouble-makers. This wonderful novel is cram-packed with subtle innuendo and blatant facts about the human condition and our Struggle to Grasp reality, religion, science and sexuality. Oh, yes....  You will learn to Grok the fullness of your life potential, if you read the underlying story.  I am a &quot;Stranger in a Strange Land.&quot; You probably are, also, if you are reading these words.  We are all outcasts and misfits, trying to find our place in the Universe...like the protagonist of this work of &quot;fiction.&quot; If your favorite Sci-Fi/ Fantasy-lover, Egghead or &quot;Trouble-Maker&quot; finds this one under the tree, they will give you a full grokking of the state of being know as Happiness.  This novel is a great way of subtly introducing Psychology, Anthropology and Sociology into your Teen-ager's life, as well. This book is a CLASSIC and should be given much respect, for it was way ahead of it's time...which is probably the reason for the release of &quot;The Original Uncut&quot; version, circa 1991.
Deepak Chopra changed my views about &quot;self-help&quot; tapes and books. Most of what I have heard or seen advertised, by others, has been very goofy or pretentious....  Deepak, however, is not your usual fare. This man is an EDUCATED, Medical-minded, Spiritual, Philosophical genius.  He explains Quantum Theories in a way that children can appreciate, as well as those who don't listen to Feynman tapes or delve into other Deep-Thinking ares. This man is Brilliant, yet he does not &quot;go over your head.&quot; He is there to help you see the light...which shines brightly from his work. Chopra's tapes and books reveal much knowledge that has been suppressed and/or ignored for centuries. His work with Wayne Dyer is fun and jam-packed with life-altering views and helpful hints, all backed with psychological, medical and LIFE-Experience research.  You will not listen to this tape once or twice and misplace the tape--however, you might loan it to a great friend (that will give it back to you!)--you will find yourself listening to his work often.  You will learn something new, each time you play the tapes. Journey Into the Boundless is one of my favorites.  A friend loaned the set to me and now I want my own copy! I believe this man's work is so important that I feel obligated to purchase a copy and share snipets with friends. Anyone interested in Spirituality, Healing or Physics would love Deepak Chopra! I cannot say enough good things about this man and his work. His voice is soothing and his words are enlightening.  This is money well-spent, and the thought-provoking, intellectual material is priceless!
The writings of Professor Tolkien are absolutely Timeless.  These books are the gauge by-which all Fantasy books are measured.  The Hobbit and The Trilogy have been the Inspiration for decades of works by other authors, yet I have not ever seen these works surpassed by anyone.  Terry Brooks is the only author I have read who even compares to J.R.R. Tolkien and his epic style.  I became fascinated with The Hobbit and Trilogy when I was in the seventh grade. I borrowed them from a friend and snuck them home. I was completely enthralled with the world Tolkien created.  I was not allowed to read anything that was even remotely related to Wizards, Witches, Astrology, D&amp;D, etc., so these books were like nothing I had ever seen, before.  I was captivated and felt the call to become a Writer.  Previously, the poetry and such that we were studying in school BORED me to tears.  I found my schooling to be mind-numbingly BORING and Tolkien became my Inspiration to Learn, create Poetry, Write stories, Study, become an Anthropologist, delve into Masonic Lore and so much more....  Throughout High-School, I had pictures of Prof. Tolkien on my wall and I desired to be like him.  Not-only was he the Greatest Fantasy Writer the world has known, but he was &quot;Professor of Anglo-Saxon, at Oxford University, from 1925 to 1945....and professor of English Language and Literature....and a Fellow of Merton College from '45 to his retirement in '59.&quot;  Check out his translations of (book title:)&quot;Sir Gawain and the Green Knight, Pearl, and Sir Orfeo&quot; (J.R.R. Tolkien)  Also, Prof. Tolkien wrote wonderful stories like &quot;Smith of Wooten Major (&amp;) Farmer Giles of Ham&quot; for children. Pop those titles into the search box! I can honestly say that reading Tolkien changed my life...for the Better! Tolkien created the highest standards of writing for generations of authors....I am quite sure he would be deeply disappointed with the majority of books published today, with numerous spelling errors and pathetic grammar.  I believe Tolkien is a god-send to English teachers. Perhaps, he can still inspire young people to elevate their Writing and English skills, from beyond. I would fight to keep his works on the shelves. I was not allowed to do my Senior Thesis about this author, despite the fact that he is such an amazing author and advocate of Literature.  I lost interest in doing my thesis and threw something together at the last minute.  Perhaps teachers should Recognize the potential for inspiring youth, via the works of J.R.R.

The writings of Professor Tolkien are absolutely Timeless.  These books are the gauge by-which all Fantasy books are measured.  The Hobbit and The Trilogy have been the Inspiration for decades of works by other authors, yet I have not ever seen these works surpassed by anyone.  Terry Brooks is the only author I have read who even compares to J.R.R. Tolkien and his epic style.  I became fascinated with The Hobbit and Trilogy when I was in the seventh grade. I borrowed them from a friend and snuck them home. I was completely enthralled with the world Tolkien created.  I was not allowed to read anything that was even remotely related to Wizards, Witches, Astrology, D&amp;D, etc., so these books were like nothing I had ever seen, before.

The writings of Professor Tolkien are absolutely Timeless.  His books are the gauge by-which all Fantasy books are measured. However, there is much more to Tolkien than many people realize.

There are so many reasons why &quot;The Templar Continuum&quot; surpasses  the genre in new information. Much of what we see in print is mere  speculation or wishful-thinking, yet these authors have dedicated an  enormous amount of time to research, travel, communication with other  authors of the genre, taking pictures of sites they write about--and seem  to be  as enthusiastic about history as most men are about sports. I have  greatly admired John J. Robinson for many years....but, I must admit,  &quot;The Templar Continuum&quot; gave me an entirely New Perspective about  St. Bernard of Clairvaux! My mental image of this monumental man has  completely altered....and, it all feels so true. Previously, I only saw him  as a weak, sickly man (possibly a puppet figure)--now, however.... (read  the book--I'm not giving it away!). Also, as someone fascinated by  Archaeology, I was &quot;immersed&quot; in the detailed description of  Cistercian Monastaries-- if only modern men would be so Clean and  Organized! There seem to be so many connections between the Cistercians and  the Essenes that many of the proposed theories of this book appear to be  inescapable. With a respectful nod to other works about The Templars,  Butler and Dafoe offer this valuable contribution to the Information  Age....with the  credentials to back-up their views. If &quot;The Warriors  And The Bankers&quot; made you crave more, the authors have Delivered! This  one is Thick with new information to add to your mental<br />catalogue of  Templar history, and will placate your need for a longer read...yet, when  you  finish, don't despair...a sequel is on the way! If you are beginning  to believe that most Templar  books are written from a template, this one  will renew your excitement.
This book is definitive proof that the Hypocrisy of our Society, &quot;teachers&quot; and religious leaders (major and minor) is scarring  humanity. Fundamentalists hate Marylin Manson....well, They Created him. I  have struggled to understand the Warped view of religion that I have seen,  throughout my life...leading me to read voraciously in areas of  Spirituality, Anthropology, etc.--and I have always been fascinated with  Musicians. Marylin Manson has proven, conclusively, that the  &quot;morals&quot; we are taught are not remotely Humanitarian in nature.  Society is based on how we present ourselves to others....not how we Truly  are, or believe. This book shows the Obsessive, Demented way in which we  are instructed to live our lives....leading to Repression, Psychosis and  all manner of weirdness. Marylin Manson simply tells it like it really IS,  instead-of lying abuot the Reality of how messed-up our Culture has become.  He does not paint a pretty picture, with white picket fences...he informs  you what goes-on in the basement, behind closed doors. This man sees that  few people are raising their children in a manner that is conducive to  creating intelligent, enlightenend human beings.... So, he is giving the  confused masses a forum to vent their frustration. I love Anthropology and  attended the Louisville, Ky concert that the locals fought against,  radically....until the camera crews left the streets. Thousands of  &quot;religious&quot; people shouted that this man would kill us, or turn  us into satanists....but, not ONE person waited to see if we survived. I  guess the camera crews didn't stay long-enough..... This book may inspire  you to study Psychology and pursue Positive Methods of raising children and  teaching children in schools, religious groups, etc. Fanatical adherence to  Dogma can create a monster.... You hate in others, what you despise in  yourself---Food for thought.
If I were only allowed to recommend One book, Rosslyn would-have been the  book I chose to review! I opened it, while contemplating which book I would  sit down with, and suddenly realized I'd read twenty pages! This one will  be a timeless treasure and a perfect gift for the Mason or  Templar-buff...but, you will be pleasantly surprised when you find  substantial, historical discussion of Religions, Culture and myth vs.  history. Rosslyn will cause many debates and many individual shifts in  consciousness. This book is not for the easily-distressed fundamentalist.  Of course, if you have not studied about religion, culture, society, et  al...you will not understand this masterpiece of truth-seeking research,  yet it may inspire you to Delve-Deeper. This work contains a concise  chronology of the development of the religion of Christianity, with many  references at the back of the book to continue your research, if you are  inclined to seek the light. I found the writing style of this book to be  very captivating and flowing, unlike some of the  less-researched/more-embellished works on the market, which are not so  articulately and poetically drafted. This book should be compared with the  other important works of the genre, and I suggest looking-into the works of  Graham Hancock. &quot;Astrological Lore of All Ages,&quot; by Elbert  Benjamine will be handy to have around, while reading this one, as well.  Don't pass Rosslyn up...you'll regret it, later.
I am surprised that this book is &quot;out of print!&quot; When I read this book, in '93, I was compelled to finish it in a few days, although I  had little time to read. Taliesin is an epic adventure in Mythology,  Legend, Oral Tradition and many other areas of interest. I recently loaned  it out and my friend devoured it! Anyone interested in The Mysteries,  History, Celtic Lore, etc. will find this book worthy of searching-for.  Also, you may want to grab a copy of &quot;The Mabinogi And Other Welsh  Tales,&quot; by Patrick K. Ford.
If you are looking for Great Books, by the most proficient and prolific authors of Astrology, Tarot, Numerology and related fields, do a search on Doris Chase Doane. She is a legend in her own time and is highly-respected by many well-informed and instructed Astrologers in the Nation and throughout the world. I purchased this book at an Astrologer's Convention in 1992 &amp; I have found it to be quite useful in the study of The Tarot. This is the only book that I have seen in the public domain (until recently), which has a Full depiction of The Brotherhood of Light Tarot cards. &quot;The Sacred Tarot,&quot; by C.C. Zain, has full-page illustrations of the Major Arcana of the B of L deck &amp; smaller representations of the Lesser Arcana...but, &quot;How to Read Tarot Cards&quot; includes illustrations of the Major and Minor Arcana in an easily-referrenced, consecutively-placed and described manor. This book is dedicated to &quot;all those brave souls, who, amidst enormous prejudice, have searched for, are investigating, and will continue to seek out the basic truths of nature's laws....&quot;
There are many reasons why I am proud to own this book, and I am delighted to find material relating to The Templars (and other Monastic Fighting  Orders) in this historical &quot;expose'&quot; of Freemasonry. I am also  quite happy to finally find a book that mentions &quot;The Odd  Fellows.&quot; The author makes a bold claim, that he will &quot;Teach  Masonry to Masons.&quot; I also thank Amazon.com for their recommendation  system, which inspired my girlfriend to send me this one as a surprise! If  you are caught-up in the Templar-craze, check-out this historical work and  measure fact with fiction. You will not be disappointed.
This book is a classic, and a treasure. Reading about the rituals of  Freemasonry is fascinating, but to see illustrations of the gestures that  are described is to take the study up to the next level. Many Masonic  symbols are illustrated and codes for reading certain Masonic texts are  revealed. This is a handbook for Masons, but those who study without the  lodge will gain some insight, from previous reading. This book will not  give you a free pass into the lodge...but, it may inspire you to petition  one! I keep the Hardback version on-display, beside The Holy Bible and  &quot;Freemasonry: A Journey Through Ritual and Symbol,&quot; by W. Kirk  MacNulty. The Paper-back, I keep for actual reading purposes. (The  Hard-Back version is Splendid!)
Knight and Lomas have done an excellent job, compling information and  making their own deductions about the origins of Hiram Abif and Masonic  Legend. People who read this book, without having a firm background of  Historical Masonic knowledge or a desire to search for the truth, or who  take many myths too literally will not unsderstand this book, as I have  noticed from the other reviews. Anyone who attempts to judge this book, or  any other book, simply because they refer to one particular book (that  Masons honor with more respect than many give them credit for) and say they  are wrong.... Well, that is not a very intellectual reaction to the  material. One should read many books about and by Masons, catalogue the  info in the mind, THEN tackle this book--which Knight and Lomas have done  such an Excellent job, piecing together! I have been deeply-immersed in  Masonic Lore, Bible Study and many other areas of study for the last decade  and was always very surprised when Masons sometimes denied the Egypt  connection with Masonry...when it was all so very obvious that Egypt holds  the secrets of this Honorable tradition. However, at the time, I was  reading with an &quot;Outsider's&quot; viewpoint, unclouded by personal  involvement, either way. Now, however, after many years of study, I believe  Knight and Lomas have finally started putting the last few pieces of the  puzzle together. If this book is read with an open mind, without prejudice  toward one's own beliefs, you may find some enlightening revelations. If  all men would honor each-other's faith, as-do Masons, this world would be a  better place to live. The Hiram Key should be read with intellect, not  Superstition. The oldest secret societies are products of Egypt, therefor  it makes since to make the final connections. Obviously, the source of Info  that people want to quote the most is not entirely accurate or untainted by  the hand of mankind. Myth is very powerful, but not necessarily accurate. I  do know that Knight and Lomas are inspiring and I am delighted to see books  such as this one in the public domain!do know that Knight and Lomas are inspiring and I am delighted to see books  such as this one in the public domain!
I found this book to be absolutely fascinating! I have always desired to  travel to Egypt and this guide has it All! John A. West is, like all men of  genius, Controversial and ahead of his time. His guide is a first-hand  experience of Egypt, compiled with resource knowledge and personal  perspective. He explains where to get what and what not to take where and  where to go when you are there! John A. West makes a historical text of  this guidebook and it can fit in most pockets, although it is quite thick  with information. I have not had the opportunity, yet, to visit  Egypt...however, the great man who introduced me to this treasure had just  come to America from Egypt on a tour around the globe. According to him,  this book was a terrific source of information during his travels through  the Ancient capitol of the world. I thank him, for recommending this guide  to me--it has been quite useful in my studies of Anthropology. I cannot  wait to test this book, for myself! History students will enjoy this one,  as well.
Even Non-Readers will love this one! There are an amazing number of  full-color and full-page pictures of Ancient Sites, Artwork, buildings and  statues. You cannot go wrong with this one, if you are interested in the  past or appreciate art. Your children will marvel at the wondrous  photographs that are so well-produced! Hancock and Santha Faiia have done a  great job and colaborate well, together. This is money well-spent!

I keep the Hardback version on-display, beside The Holy Bible and  &quot;Freemasonry: A Journey Through Ritual and Symbol,&quot; by W. Kirk  MacNulty. This Paper-back version is just as impressive as the Hard-back,  the other one is simply prettier to look at on the shelf. Either way, you  can't lose!
This book is not the most well-written or well-researched book I have ever  read...but, it is essential reading for understanding Anti-Masonry and  Conspiracy Theory. Although the author does a botch-up job on researching  the Masons, and the book is written from a Myopic viewpoint, it does give  the reader a good understanding of where the fundamentalists and  propagandists are coming-from. One should not read this book without also  reading &quot;Unholy Worship?&quot; by Steven Dafoe and &quot;A Pilgrim's  Path,&quot; by John J. Robinson to cleanse the mind. I must admit, I do not  comprehend why the author is so distressed about the concept of the world  coming-together, in Union with one-another.... He seems to completely  contradict himself, by preaching Christianity, yet preaching against  Unification at the same time. I thought Christianity was based on  unification and Brotherly love. Well...at-least he was right about the  &quot;new money.&quot; :)
This book will send Anti-Masons and Evangelists scurrying through dusty  book piles, looking for more irrelevant material to feed the frenzy of  fanaticism! The Taxil hoax, which seems to be one of the most-quoted  anti-masonic pieces of &quot;literature&quot; is explained. Many other  aspects of criticism against the fraternity are also explained. The authors  do a terrific job of debunking (easily) the myth of Templar/Freemason  &quot;Unholy Worship.&quot; This is a great book for Freemasons to have, if  they are confronted with confused views (or Sincere Concern, from church  members) or would just like a quick synopsis of the general attitudes about  their fraternity to have on-hand. This book will enlighten Non-Masons and  Anti-Masons and dispell some of the Myths. This is a thin book, with  references to other sources of information, therefor it is a quick  read--yet, you will refer to if often. Many Masons do not believe in  answering accusations against their Honorable order...they do not need to.  They simply need this book--it will do the job for them. Also, this book  should be followed by &quot;A Pilgrim's Path,&quot; by John J. Robinson,  who explains--thoroughly and more in-depth--the views for and against  Freemasonry. I am truly happy that Dafoe has put-together such a wonderful,  informative book. Buy one for your church, so the congregation will rest  at-ease knowing their Masonic Brethren are not doing anything negative.  (The cover on my copy--recent purchase from Amazon.com--only has pics of  Albert Pike and Leo Taxil, which would not look inappropriate carrying into  church, to hand to the Minister/Preacher/Priest/Rabbi, etc.)
Manly P. Hall (33rd degree Mason &amp; founder of The Philosophical Research Society) gives us an illuminating, poetically written treatise on the origins of Ancient Masonry and the underlying, meaning of much Masonic Symbolism and practice. Hall's book is a poetic read, that can be consumed in one sitting, yet will be read and refered to many times again. He details some of the spiritual aspects of the hidden meanings of Masonry and the ancient origins from-which the modern fraternity receives it's wisdom. The Foreward is by Reynold E. Blight, 33rd degree, K.T. &amp; the illustrations are by J. Augustus Knapp, 32nd degree.... Obviously, this man is viewed as a Great, within the ranks of the Fraternity. You will treasure this book and feel uplifted, each time you open the cover and read a random sentence or paragraph. You will learn the true reasons why a man should petition for admission into the Honorable Masonic Lodge....not for personal advancement--but, for advancement of the human race.
I have a special place in my heart for this deck, though I have used it seldom since '93 or so. This is the First Tarot Deck I ever  owned--purchased on October 13, 1990. I believe this is a great Starter  Deck and I always had great success with the readings. One particular  reading, that I wrote in my journal, was absolutely astonishing and  accurate to the tiniest detail.... I love the great hard-back, beautiful  book that comes with the deck (complete with attached ribbon bookmark). At  the time, I was not interested in the more popular decks and was drawn to  this one.... I believe Women and Artistic-minded people will enjoy and  treasure this deck. It is a great introduction to the Tarot, and inspired  me to write a Poem.
The Brotherhood of Light Tarot is one of the many decks in the world that has the 8 & 11 reversed (e.g., \\"The Thoth Deck\\"). It is not the easiest to use, because the cards are produced in Black and White (explained below) and the Lesser Arcana have minimal symbolism.... The Black & White rendering of the deck is for the purpose of the Initiate gaining a deeper contact with the cards and learning the symbolism & color-relationship of each aspect of the card by RESEARCHING and studying the texts....and coloring them, by hand (which I do not advise, until you study Tarot--esp., \\"The Sacred Tarot,\\" by C.C. Zain. THE MAJOR ARCANA are wonderful--very Unique ! You will treasure this deck, even if you do not connect with it until you have read a few books and gained a firm ground upon-which to draw info from the Inner Plane. This is mostly a deck for initiates of the BofL.
I have always believed in equality and feel ashamed of the way other men have treated women. At times, I have wished that I could completely  disassociate myself from Patriarchal society and men, in-general. In fact,  if not for The Masons I would probably just give up on men, as a general  rule. However, I suppose it is better to offer them books like this one,  which is enlightening and gives a wonderful representation of The Feminine  and Goddess influences on humankind. This book gives men a view of Woman  undistorted by patriarchal, propagandist, or nonsensical traditional  notions passed down through the generations that place women in a lower  realm of Society and Culture, than men. You would have to live in a cave to  be unaware of The Goddess imagery pre-dating God imagery...however,  cave-dwellers will be awakened by this well-written book. I read it in '93  and it made a tremendous impact on my thinking, although I was already very  appreciative of Women and their nature. This book will defeat some Silly  Superstitions about a woman's Moon Time, as well. Read this book and stop  treating a woman's Period as something threatening, disgusting or worse. I  cannot say enough good things about &quot;Mysteries of The Dark Moon,&quot;  it is an Anthropologist's delight!
This set of cards, with book, is obviously made for women, by women....  However, I found it very useful, not-only as an Anthropological collector's  item, but as a Spiritual Tool. A man who is not willing to accept the  Feminine in himself and the world will Never achieve harmony with Nature's  Laws. This set is a Wonderful gift or purchase for anyone interested in  Spirituality/Religion/Mythology/Goddesses (THEY ARE RENDERED VERY  ARTISTICALLY AND EXUDE BEAUTY AND FLOWING, GRACEFUL FORM !) and related  fields of interest. You cannot go wrong with this set. If-only Tarot cards  were produced so well! My Tarot collection pales in comparison with the  presentation of these cards...which you will find yourself meditating upon,  simply because they are so Inviting and Beautiful.... I bought one for my  Girlfriend, and had to get one for myself !
How can one review the words of a Genius, many years ahead of his time....a man who's mind grasped concepts that most people still do not remotely comprehend...a man who worked as a Humanitarian, while the world  thought him a destroyer...? This book contains Einstien's views on  Politics, Disarmament, Education, Freedom, The Jewish People, Germany, and  much more. I found this work to be very inspiring and hope to see it never  go out of print....for the Great Minds of the past are our Hope for The  Future.
If this is the book edited by Louis Fischer, I recommend it for an Uplifting read, that makes you feel better about the insane world we live in. Gandhi was a great man and, fortunately, he wrote his mental processes  down for us to read, today. He believed that we should all stop being  ignorant towards one-another, over misunderstandings about religion or skin  color and work together to form a more harmonious union as the human race.  Gandhi was a Humanitarian and read many Holy Books, therefor understood  that everyone can worship their God and live their faith, cooperatively  with those of other faiths. Gandhi is a must, for all intellectual  minds...and should be for those who are still living with propaganda-filled  thoughts of hatred towards others, because they are different.
I grew-up reading the Hard-Cover version of this book, which I have inherited from my Grandfather and treasure along-side my Masonic books. There is so much information within the covers of Tompkin's book that is  helpful to all students of The Mysteries, that should be read and filed in  the mind for later reference. This book is also the first source of  information I ever came-across about Akhenaten, the &quot;Rebel&quot; ruler  of Egypt. I know that the Hard-Cover edition had many, many illustrations.  This book also contains Mathematical break-downs and Geometry involved with  The Pyramids, including a well-illustrated explanation of &quot;The Golden  Section.&quot;
I have been watching this guy, for a long time, now. Many people try to discredit him, because they cannot handle the truth. However, I believe that one day Hancock will be fully recognized for his Search for The Truth. In Fact, I dare-say THE SPHINX is THE KEY to unlock the past and Future of humankind. Perhaps, it is time for Punctuated Equilibrium. I was especially interested in pages 210-211....
Before I became interested in Freemasonry &amp; before studying Mystery School works, when I was a teenager....just-after being booted out of home for having an earring and hair below collar-length....a friend talked with me about my natural psychic abilities and loaned me &quot;The Occult,&quot; by Colin Wilson. This book left a great impression on me and I have always remembered and appreciated this work. Also, this book introduced me to Numerology &amp; opened my thinking in other areas. The various characters involved in The Occult are discussed, throughout the book and...if I remember correctly...I believe there are pictures of famous occultists in Black and White. I have never owned a copy of this book, but the copy I borrowed changed hands so many times that I can assure it's value as a good read.... I think Wilson did a great job with what he knew at the time.
Where do I begin!  Ok, when I first saw this book, I thought... hmm, maybe...money is tight.  Then, one day I just grabbed it and took it home. Imagine my surprise, when I discovered the author has a section called  &quot;Reconstructing the Temple of Solomon with Philosopher's Stones,&quot;  followed by &quot;The rose, the cross, and the mysteries&quot;...&amp;  &quot;Atavisms and Illuminati !&quot; At that point, I was Hooked. I have  ALWAYS been interested in Psychology and I have read many books on the  subject. Ten years ago, I read &quot;The Occult,&quot; by Colin Wilson,  which informs the reader about Jung's split with Freud and (if I remember  correctly) has a copy of a letter from Freud, warning Jung not to get  involved with the occult and trying to steer him away from the direction he  was going with his work.... Well, THIS book, by Noll, really digs into  Jung's work and explains his psychic experimentation, relationship with his  Ancestors and various methods employed to reach into his Heritage and  draw-forth the tools of Modern Psychology. No wonder some Christians  believe Psychology is the work of the devil....nearly all of Jung's work is  based upon Occult (Hidden) Principles and Paganism. The Sub-Title of this  book says it all : &quot;The Secret Life of Carl Jung.&quot; Obviously, he  had to play-down the influence of the occult in his work, in his public  life...but, this book takes a look behind the scenes and also explains how  Jung acquired his funding--this part is important, so I won't spoil it. I  was excited to find-out that his family was involved with Freemasonry and  that Masonic Symbolism was added to the Family Crest. This book is, truly,  an exciting read...from a psychological, historical, anthropological,  occult, Masonic or &quot;just curious&quot; point-of-view. If I had  realized how great this book was, I would have acquired it much sooner!
If you are an open-minded person, that has always asked \\"too many questions,\\" this book is for you! Whether you are a Philosopher, Theologian, Freemason, Wiccan or Occultist, this book is a welcome addition  to your collection. The theories expressed in this book can be compared with the writings of Henry Lincoln (\\"The  Holy Place: The Mystery of Rennes-le-Chateau....\\" & his more  recent works), \\"The Hiram Key,\\" by Knight & Lomas & the  other books of this genre. Right or Wrong, this book will get your wheels  turning....  Research the genre and decide for yourself.
If you are a Freemason, or are even remotely interested in the subject, you should own this book....if, for no other reason than the fact that this book contains many, many full-color, full-page pictures &amp; other  graphics, such as Craft Symbolism, the &quot;Tools&quot; of the Craft,  Trestle Boards, etc. This book also contains an overview of Freemasonry,  including some of the esoteric aspects of The Craft--even mentioning the  Hermetic axiom: &quot;As Above, So Below.&quot; I honestly believe all  Masons should own books like this--esp., since so many still believe in the  outdated concept of not talking about Masonry....even to their own sons and  daughters...or, Wives.  Leave this book lying around your den or on the  coffee table. I keep my copy on the top shelf of my Masonic Research  Bookshelf, beside &quot;Duncans Ritual&quot; (collectors edition), The Holy  Bible and my Masonic antique items. It really sets-off my little shrine to  Masonry! This book has more pictures than you can shake a level at....so,  stop twirling your compass and get out your credit card!
This is a great book to add to your collection, if you are interested in, or research, Secret Societies. It has been a long time, since I read this one, but this book gave me good reference material to research & many other books of this genre refer to Howard's book. Add it to your collection, so it will be on-hand when you see quotes in other works.<br />The information provided by another reader is true--the information about George Washington is completely in Error in \\"The Occult Conspiracy.\\"  I have posted the same information in clubs, but I forgot to return to this review and Update my findings.<br />\\"A New Encyclopaedia of Freemasonry,\\" by A.E. Waite & other sources discount much of the material in \\"The Occult Conspiracy.\\"<br />However, this books is useful as a reference book/bibliography.
This book is a must-have for those interested in The Templars. In a sea of Nonsense and ancient falsehoods, regarding the order of Knights Templar, this book is a shining gem of common-sense. The authors strive to use  Logic, instead of silly fake documents and other ludicrous garbage to  speculate about the known and suspected history of the Templars. Instead of  quoting long sections of other recent books, the authors simply refer you  to the other works, assuming you have probably already read them, anyway  (and...they are most-likely correct). If you have read the other works  about the Templars--esp., Robinson's &quot;Born in Blood,&quot; you will  find this book a concise, easy read with some new thoughts on the subject  of the Templar's history. If not, this book gives you ample research  suggestions....  So, either way, you can't lose. Another benefit of this  book is that it is thin-enough (because the authors get directly to the  point, instead-of heavy quoting and such) to place it in your jacket or  pants pocket. This would be a great book to loan to your friends, if you  practice my own method of using clear contact paper (slowly and carefully)  over the cover of the book, to prevent it's destruction in transit. Look  for their other books, as-well! I loved &quot;Unholy Worship? The Myth of  the Baphomet, Templar, Freemason Connection,&quot; by Stephen Dafoe. If you  enjoy thinking for yourself, you will enjoy their books....if you do not  like thinking for yourself read Kah!
I recommend this book to Everyone interested in Masonry or Anti-Masonry--esp., to those joining The Craft (see the Dedication of the book) &amp; their loved ones. John J Robinson gives a well-written  appraisal of Freemasonry and the Anti-Masonic Propagandists, who slander  the organization. Everything he says can easily be backed-up with a little  research &amp; this book is a concise, sensible, articulate piece of  research material that sums-up most of the important aspects of  Freemasonry.... and the unfortunate, ridiculous attacks by the Uninitiated.  A Great &quot;coffee table&quot; book for Freemasons. Buy one for your  Church and loan it to those who are confused by the evangelists and other  money-mongers. My Credentials? : I made my decision to join The Freemasons  long-ago, not knowing if I would be found worthy... and not knowing anyone  of my generation who had joined this organization, that I admired so-much.  As I sought methods of joining the fraternal order, I stumbled-across a  cornucopia of information about Freemasonry. I was distressed to discover  that Anti-Masonic propaganda was being used by various groups to further  the ignorance of various causes. I read everything I could get my hands on  about The Masons, for many years, because of my great respect for them. I  know many Masons, in other states, and my family--The Lincolns--have been  affiliated with Masonic orders for generations, but my Grandfather kept all  of his secrets.... My Grandmother was in The Order of the Eastern Star, and  so was my Great-Grandmother (a VERY religious, Christian woman). I am also  a member of a Humanitarian organization that has always attracted  Freemasons and is based on Masonic Principles.  My experience with Masonry  has made me a better man and I have seen nothing (Despite the Propaganda)  that would make me think any less of Freemasonry. -- &quot;A Pilgrim's  Path&quot; is a book that could have saved me ten years of research and  helped me to teach others, along the way, without saying a word.....  However, my research has led me to the conclusion that Mr. Robinson is very  knowledgeable and I recommend his book, because I admire his work and his  writing skills. I believe this book will be adopted as a Masonic Handbook  for those joining or interested in the Freemasons. Women want to know more  about The Masons and this book is for them, as well!thers, along the way, without saying a word.....   However, my research has led me to the conclusion that Mr. Robinson is very  knowledgeable and I recommend his book, because I admire his work and his  writing skills.

I absolutely could not put this book down! I'd read Robinson's &quot;Born in Blood&quot; a few times and was craving more.... Then, I found &quot;Dungeon, Fire and Sword&quot; at a local bookstore (before my  girlfriend introduced me to Amazon.com). I Devoured the book. I could not  stop reading, but I did not want it to end. When I finished the book, I  wanted MORE John J. Robinson and--luckily--my girlfriend had purchased  &quot;A Pilgrim's Path&quot; for me, via Amazon.com....it came in the mail,  as a surprise! I finished that one in two sittings.....  John J Robinson is  an excellent writer.  I admire him, greatly.
I have been deeply immersed in the study of Masonry, since 1991, via books. I have enjoyed studying the History of the organization and I have many books by and about Freemasons, lining my shelves. I purchased a copy of this book before several High-Degree Freemasons recommended \\"Born in Blood\\" to me, along with books by Mackey, Manly P. Hall and all the Greats of the Fraternal Order, prior to by becoming a member of the Honorable Fraternity. Personally, if these High-Degree Masons had not recommended the book (\\"Born in Blood\\"), I would still count it as one of my favorite books of all time (I have read voraciously all of my life). I could not put this book down....nor could I put \\"Dungeon Fire And Sword\\" (Robinson) down....or, \\"A Pilgrim's Path.\\" (Robinson). My copy of \\"Born in Blood\\" and the other John J. Robinson books are proudly on display, next to \\"The History of Freemasonry\\" (Mackey) & \\"A New Encyclopaedia of Freemasonry\\" (Waite) on my Masonic Research bookshelf. I highly recommend Robinson's books to anyone interested in The Craft, or in the history of the world. I find his writing absolutely fascinating and exciting...and I love the way he ends chapters!<br /><br />Note: I loved this book & \\"A Pilgrim's Path\\" so much that I joined the FM and took my first degree in June. For those who do not know, this is a RE-WRITE of my original review, written last year. I had to fix a couple of things in my review, by deleting a few lines. Additionally, I have learned that John J. Robinson received the 33rd degree, in Freemasonry, because of his research and involvement with the organization. His research led him to the same conclusion, that it led me.... Where do I sign-up? \\"Born in Blood\\" earned Robinson the 33 and paved the way for the current wave of Masonic Education.
