This is the most funniest book I ever read in a very long time. On my Christmas break, I spent a lot of time reading the book. I found the recipe's to be quite delicious and familiar. The book was a little facetous. The funniest part was when the author stated that &quot;The bland was leading the bland&quot; I found this statement to be quite funny and facetous. A lot of people always talk about the &quot;blind leading the blind.&quot; In retrospect, food  does not taste very good when there are people in the kitchen that do not know how to cook. The phrase is quite similar to &quot; a chicken running with his head cut off.&quot; In other words, this is a person that do not know what they are doing. Another interesting part was the subtitle&quot; The Perfect Cork Screw.&quot; This part was quite intriguing. It had my attention. I was all ears and eyes. How do you actually be a nose anyway? Tell me please what is involve, do people go around sniffing people's things to be a nose. Maybe there is a little bit research that is involved with being a nose. For the final analysis of this short but sweet book review,&quot;Green Thumbs and  Black Tomatoes&quot; was the best part, it kind of remind me of what I cook with. It can be quite similar to ones ancesrty.                                  Good-bye
