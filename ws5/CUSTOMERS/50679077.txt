Mystery Cat and the Chocolate Trap was my first M.C. adventure.  Much to my delight, I discovered this M.C. book over at my best friend's house at the time.  She and I instantly swapped and were in love with M.C.  We fashioned ourselves like we were the two heroines in the book and scoured the town looking for our \\"M.C.\\"  This is a great book series, there are, sadly, only 3 books total.  Please read them all, share them with your children.  This is a delightful children's series about one very special cat!!  A+++
Mystery Cat and the Chocolate Trap was the first Mystery Cat book I ever read when I was a kid.  I found this book here on Amazon as an adult and was SO excited to find another M.C. mystery to order for my kids.  The REAL title is \\"Mystery Cat and the Monkey Business\\".  I am very much a cat person and when I read this book I was so enthralled with the adventures M.C. has solving his mysteries.  And, being a girl myself, I identified with the main character dealing with her sometimes heroic, sometimes annoying cat.  This series is a wonderful series and I hope that someday it comes back out of obscurity.  I know my children will be reading them!  A fantastic mystery story and a fantastic cat!!

Okay, if you are a romantic and you always want the characters in your novels to fall in love... you will definately love this book.  If you like outright hilarity and antics that make you giggle as you read, you'll love it, too.  But, if you especially love subtle humor, i.e. an anime-esque moment where a character is staring at someone in shock and in disbelief, and in the background something else is blowing up, emphasizing their shock... you'll love it.  Diana Wynne Jones has been writing for an awfully long time and she has reached a point in her novels where she hits the subtle notes so well that I end up rolling aroung laughing.  I was in fits for the whole last chapter (which is pretty long as things just keep happening!).<br /><br />This is a great book for both kids and adults.  The book is about 6 young people who are attending the Wizarding University in the world Jones created for The Dark Lord of Derkholm.  In the process of meeting each other, learning the true meaning of magic and the process of learning itself, and in trying to deal with their insane professors, they learn about themselves and about each other.  There are some very poignant moments at the end of the book when some of the kids have to dig into the pain of their pasts to try to fix themselves and their magic before it is too late.<br /><br />It is a great book about growing up and learning about yourself.  Make sure you read The Dark Lord of Derkholm first, or you'll spoil all of the surprises and wonderful things that happen in that fantastic book!
I just finished this book and it's wonderful!  I love Diana Wynne Jones novels, I started with the Chronicles of Chrestomanci long ago and just got around to this series.  The Dark Lord of Derkholm is a fantastic story, it's really funny, too.  It starts off with our two heroes, Derk and his son Blade, being introduced; arguing with each other as they will from time to time throughout the book.  This is a fun story about a world of people who have been made to turn their country into a theme park for the tourists from another world.  These \\"Pilgrim Parties\\" come through once a year to be guided through on tours through this magical world.  The Pilgrims come from a world not too much unlike our own.  But the Pilgrim Parties destroy much of the world on their way through each year.  So this year, the rulers of this world decide that they have to put a stop to it... thus Derk is made the \\"Dark Lord\\" this year, and the chaos ensues...<br /><br />Overall this is a story about a very interesting and loving family and the trials that they must endure to save their own world... all the while, not really having any idea what they're doing.  It's incredibly funny and it's a very touching family story underneath.  I loved it!

I remember almost every one of Henry's antics and adventures and I read these books 20 years ago.  This book is the classic that started it all.  I love the Ramona books, but Henry will always be my favorite.  He has his shortcomings, but he is a true good spirit, a good friend, and a great dog owner.  Make sure to have your kids read this book, it is truly just a sweet story about a boy, his life, and his dog.

I bought \\"The Golden Compass\\" while waiting in the San Francisco Airport during a 9 hour layover.  I love reading children's books and the cover looked interesting.  However, I was unable to keep my eyes open and fell asleep until the announcer kindly woke me up to tell me I had to get on my plane.  Somehow the book ended up in the trunk of my car and remained there for about 2 years.  One cold night when I was stuck waiting to pick someone up, I went rummaging around in there and found it.  So I started reading.  I didn't stop reading until the next morning (well, despite the half hour when I hurriedly dropped my friend off and flew back to my house to keep reading).  I scoured the local bookstores for the two sequels the next day.<br /><br />The Golden Compass begins a trilogy that takes you through the mind and spirit of one brave and amazing little girl.  It explores spirituality, theology, \\"magic\\" (if you can call it that), and just the trauma and joy of growing up.  It's a beautiful beginning.  Overall, it is a story about growing up, about finding out what innocence really is, and about finding yourself.<br /><br />You will, however, need to buy all three books at one time.  You'll be left with more questions than answers after this one.  And, I'd have to say, this is a book for mature children.  I'm not saying a kid couldn't handle this, I'm saying it has to be a mature individual, one able to understand abstract concepts and ideas.  And one who is open to new ideas and ways of looking at things.  This trilogy could really scare some kids.  It reminded me a lot of when I read The Last Battle<br /><br />by C. S. Lewis.  I was in 5th grade.  Didn't quite scare me, I'd have to say, but shook me, deeply.  This book has the same quality.<br /><br />It's a fantastic adventure and any young person could identify themselves with Lyra or the other main characters.  A definate read for the mature young adult.

Mystery Cat and the Chocolate Trap was my first M.C. adventure.  Much to my delight, I discovered this M.C. book over at my best friend's house at the time.  She and I instantly swapped and were in love with M.C.  We fashioned ourselves like we were the two heroines in the book and scoured the town looking for our \\"M.C.\\"  This is a great book series, there are, sadly, only 3 books total.  Please read them all, share them with your children.  This is a delightful children's series about one very special cat!!  A+++
Mystery Cat and the Chocolate Trap was the first Mystery Cat book I ever read when I was a kid.  I found this book here on Amazon as an adult and was SO excited to find another M.C. mystery to order for my kids.  The REAL title is \\"Mystery Cat and the Monkey Business\\".  I am very much a cat person and when I read this book I was so enthralled with the adventures M.C. has solving his mysteries.  And, being a girl myself, I identified with the main character dealing with her sometimes heroic, sometimes annoying cat.  This series is a wonderful series and I hope that someday it comes back out of obscurity.  I know my children will be reading them!  A fantastic mystery story and a fantastic cat!!

Okay, if you are a romantic and you always want the characters in your novels to fall in love... you will definately love this book.  If you like outright hilarity and antics that make you giggle as you read, you'll love it, too.  But, if you especially love subtle humor, i.e. an anime-esque moment where a character is staring at someone in shock and in disbelief, and in the background something else is blowing up, emphasizing their shock... you'll love it.  Diana Wynne Jones has been writing for an awfully long time and she has reached a point in her novels where she hits the subtle notes so well that I end up rolling aroung laughing.  I was in fits for the whole last chapter (which is pretty long as things just keep happening!).<br /><br />This is a great book for both kids and adults.  The book is about 6 young people who are attending the Wizarding University in the world Jones created for The Dark Lord of Derkholm.  In the process of meeting each other, learning the true meaning of magic and the process of learning itself, and in trying to deal with their insane professors, they learn about themselves and about each other.  There are some very poignant moments at the end of the book when some of the kids have to dig into the pain of their pasts to try to fix themselves and their magic before it is too late.<br /><br />It is a great book about growing up and learning about yourself.  Make sure you read The Dark Lord of Derkholm first, or you'll spoil all of the surprises and wonderful things that happen in that fantastic book!
I just finished this book and it's wonderful!  I love Diana Wynne Jones novels, I started with the Chronicles of Chrestomanci long ago and just got around to this series.  The Dark Lord of Derkholm is a fantastic story, it's really funny, too.  It starts off with our two heroes, Derk and his son Blade, being introduced; arguing with each other as they will from time to time throughout the book.  This is a fun story about a world of people who have been made to turn their country into a theme park for the tourists from another world.  These \\"Pilgrim Parties\\" come through once a year to be guided through on tours through this magical world.  The Pilgrims come from a world not too much unlike our own.  But the Pilgrim Parties destroy much of the world on their way through each year.  So this year, the rulers of this world decide that they have to put a stop to it... thus Derk is made the \\"Dark Lord\\" this year, and the chaos ensues...<br /><br />Overall this is a story about a very interesting and loving family and the trials that they must endure to save their own world... all the while, not really having any idea what they're doing.  It's incredibly funny and it's a very touching family story underneath.  I loved it!

I remember almost every one of Henry's antics and adventures and I read these books 20 years ago.  This book is the classic that started it all.  I love the Ramona books, but Henry will always be my favorite.  He has his shortcomings, but he is a true good spirit, a good friend, and a great dog owner.  Make sure to have your kids read this book, it is truly just a sweet story about a boy, his life, and his dog.

I bought \\"The Golden Compass\\" while waiting in the San Francisco Airport during a 9 hour layover.  I love reading children's books and the cover looked interesting.  However, I was unable to keep my eyes open and fell asleep until the announcer kindly woke me up to tell me I had to get on my plane.  Somehow the book ended up in the trunk of my car and remained there for about 2 years.  One cold night when I was stuck waiting to pick someone up, I went rummaging around in there and found it.  So I started reading.  I didn't stop reading until the next morning (well, despite the half hour when I hurriedly dropped my friend off and flew back to my house to keep reading).  I scoured the local bookstores for the two sequels the next day.<br /><br />The Golden Compass begins a trilogy that takes you through the mind and spirit of one brave and amazing little girl.  It explores spirituality, theology, \\"magic\\" (if you can call it that), and just the trauma and joy of growing up.  It's a beautiful beginning.  Overall, it is a story about growing up, about finding out what innocence really is, and about finding yourself.<br /><br />You will, however, need to buy all three books at one time.  You'll be left with more questions than answers after this one.  And, I'd have to say, this is a book for mature children.  I'm not saying a kid couldn't handle this, I'm saying it has to be a mature individual, one able to understand abstract concepts and ideas.  And one who is open to new ideas and ways of looking at things.  This trilogy could really scare some kids.  It reminded me a lot of when I read The Last Battle<br /><br />by C. S. Lewis.  I was in 5th grade.  Didn't quite scare me, I'd have to say, but shook me, deeply.  This book has the same quality.<br /><br />It's a fantastic adventure and any young person could identify themselves with Lyra or the other main characters.  A definate read for the mature young adult.

Mystery Cat and the Chocolate Trap was my first M.C. adventure.  Much to my delight, I discovered this M.C. book over at my best friend's house at the time.  She and I instantly swapped and were in love with M.C.  We fashioned ourselves like we were the two heroines in the book and scoured the town looking for our \\"M.C.\\"  This is a great book series, there are, sadly, only 3 books total.  Please read them all, share them with your children.  This is a delightful children's series about one very special cat!!  A+++
Mystery Cat and the Chocolate Trap was the first Mystery Cat book I ever read when I was a kid.  I found this book here on Amazon as an adult and was SO excited to find another M.C. mystery to order for my kids.  The REAL title is \\"Mystery Cat and the Monkey Business\\".  I am very much a cat person and when I read this book I was so enthralled with the adventures M.C. has solving his mysteries.  And, being a girl myself, I identified with the main character dealing with her sometimes heroic, sometimes annoying cat.  This series is a wonderful series and I hope that someday it comes back out of obscurity.  I know my children will be reading them!  A fantastic mystery story and a fantastic cat!!

Okay, if you are a romantic and you always want the characters in your novels to fall in love... you will definately love this book.  If you like outright hilarity and antics that make you giggle as you read, you'll love it, too.  But, if you especially love subtle humor, i.e. an anime-esque moment where a character is staring at someone in shock and in disbelief, and in the background something else is blowing up, emphasizing their shock... you'll love it.  Diana Wynne Jones has been writing for an awfully long time and she has reached a point in her novels where she hits the subtle notes so well that I end up rolling aroung laughing.  I was in fits for the whole last chapter (which is pretty long as things just keep happening!).<br /><br />This is a great book for both kids and adults.  The book is about 6 young people who are attending the Wizarding University in the world Jones created for The Dark Lord of Derkholm.  In the process of meeting each other, learning the true meaning of magic and the process of learning itself, and in trying to deal with their insane professors, they learn about themselves and about each other.  There are some very poignant moments at the end of the book when some of the kids have to dig into the pain of their pasts to try to fix themselves and their magic before it is too late.<br /><br />It is a great book about growing up and learning about yourself.  Make sure you read The Dark Lord of Derkholm first, or you'll spoil all of the surprises and wonderful things that happen in that fantastic book!
I just finished this book and it's wonderful!  I love Diana Wynne Jones novels, I started with the Chronicles of Chrestomanci long ago and just got around to this series.  The Dark Lord of Derkholm is a fantastic story, it's really funny, too.  It starts off with our two heroes, Derk and his son Blade, being introduced; arguing with each other as they will from time to time throughout the book.  This is a fun story about a world of people who have been made to turn their country into a theme park for the tourists from another world.  These \\"Pilgrim Parties\\" come through once a year to be guided through on tours through this magical world.  The Pilgrims come from a world not too much unlike our own.  But the Pilgrim Parties destroy much of the world on their way through each year.  So this year, the rulers of this world decide that they have to put a stop to it... thus Derk is made the \\"Dark Lord\\" this year, and the chaos ensues...<br /><br />Overall this is a story about a very interesting and loving family and the trials that they must endure to save their own world... all the while, not really having any idea what they're doing.  It's incredibly funny and it's a very touching family story underneath.  I loved it!

I remember almost every one of Henry's antics and adventures and I read these books 20 years ago.  This book is the classic that started it all.  I love the Ramona books, but Henry will always be my favorite.  He has his shortcomings, but he is a true good spirit, a good friend, and a great dog owner.  Make sure to have your kids read this book, it is truly just a sweet story about a boy, his life, and his dog.

I bought \\"The Golden Compass\\" while waiting in the San Francisco Airport during a 9 hour layover.  I love reading children's books and the cover looked interesting.  However, I was unable to keep my eyes open and fell asleep until the announcer kindly woke me up to tell me I had to get on my plane.  Somehow the book ended up in the trunk of my car and remained there for about 2 years.  One cold night when I was stuck waiting to pick someone up, I went rummaging around in there and found it.  So I started reading.  I didn't stop reading until the next morning (well, despite the half hour when I hurriedly dropped my friend off and flew back to my house to keep reading).  I scoured the local bookstores for the two sequels the next day.<br /><br />The Golden Compass begins a trilogy that takes you through the mind and spirit of one brave and amazing little girl.  It explores spirituality, theology, \\"magic\\" (if you can call it that), and just the trauma and joy of growing up.  It's a beautiful beginning.  Overall, it is a story about growing up, about finding out what innocence really is, and about finding yourself.<br /><br />You will, however, need to buy all three books at one time.  You'll be left with more questions than answers after this one.  And, I'd have to say, this is a book for mature children.  I'm not saying a kid couldn't handle this, I'm saying it has to be a mature individual, one able to understand abstract concepts and ideas.  And one who is open to new ideas and ways of looking at things.  This trilogy could really scare some kids.  It reminded me a lot of when I read The Last Battle<br /><br />by C. S. Lewis.  I was in 5th grade.  Didn't quite scare me, I'd have to say, but shook me, deeply.  This book has the same quality.<br /><br />It's a fantastic adventure and any young person could identify themselves with Lyra or the other main characters.  A definate read for the mature young adult.

Mystery Cat and the Chocolate Trap was my first M.C. adventure.  Much to my delight, I discovered this M.C. book over at my best friend's house at the time.  She and I instantly swapped and were in love with M.C.  We fashioned ourselves like we were the two heroines in the book and scoured the town looking for our \\"M.C.\\"  This is a great book series, there are, sadly, only 3 books total.  Please read them all, share them with your children.  This is a delightful children's series about one very special cat!!  A+++
Mystery Cat and the Chocolate Trap was the first Mystery Cat book I ever read when I was a kid.  I found this book here on Amazon as an adult and was SO excited to find another M.C. mystery to order for my kids.  The REAL title is \\"Mystery Cat and the Monkey Business\\".  I am very much a cat person and when I read this book I was so enthralled with the adventures M.C. has solving his mysteries.  And, being a girl myself, I identified with the main character dealing with her sometimes heroic, sometimes annoying cat.  This series is a wonderful series and I hope that someday it comes back out of obscurity.  I know my children will be reading them!  A fantastic mystery story and a fantastic cat!!

Okay, if you are a romantic and you always want the characters in your novels to fall in love... you will definately love this book.  If you like outright hilarity and antics that make you giggle as you read, you'll love it, too.  But, if you especially love subtle humor, i.e. an anime-esque moment where a character is staring at someone in shock and in disbelief, and in the background something else is blowing up, emphasizing their shock... you'll love it.  Diana Wynne Jones has been writing for an awfully long time and she has reached a point in her novels where she hits the subtle notes so well that I end up rolling aroung laughing.  I was in fits for the whole last chapter (which is pretty long as things just keep happening!).<br /><br />This is a great book for both kids and adults.  The book is about 6 young people who are attending the Wizarding University in the world Jones created for The Dark Lord of Derkholm.  In the process of meeting each other, learning the true meaning of magic and the process of learning itself, and in trying to deal with their insane professors, they learn about themselves and about each other.  There are some very poignant moments at the end of the book when some of the kids have to dig into the pain of their pasts to try to fix themselves and their magic before it is too late.<br /><br />It is a great book about growing up and learning about yourself.  Make sure you read The Dark Lord of Derkholm first, or you'll spoil all of the surprises and wonderful things that happen in that fantastic book!
I just finished this book and it's wonderful!  I love Diana Wynne Jones novels, I started with the Chronicles of Chrestomanci long ago and just got around to this series.  The Dark Lord of Derkholm is a fantastic story, it's really funny, too.  It starts off with our two heroes, Derk and his son Blade, being introduced; arguing with each other as they will from time to time throughout the book.  This is a fun story about a world of people who have been made to turn their country into a theme park for the tourists from another world.  These \\"Pilgrim Parties\\" come through once a year to be guided through on tours through this magical world.  The Pilgrims come from a world not too much unlike our own.  But the Pilgrim Parties destroy much of the world on their way through each year.  So this year, the rulers of this world decide that they have to put a stop to it... thus Derk is made the \\"Dark Lord\\" this year, and the chaos ensues...<br /><br />Overall this is a story about a very interesting and loving family and the trials that they must endure to save their own world... all the while, not really having any idea what they're doing.  It's incredibly funny and it's a very touching family story underneath.  I loved it!

I remember almost every one of Henry's antics and adventures and I read these books 20 years ago.  This book is the classic that started it all.  I love the Ramona books, but Henry will always be my favorite.  He has his shortcomings, but he is a true good spirit, a good friend, and a great dog owner.  Make sure to have your kids read this book, it is truly just a sweet story about a boy, his life, and his dog.

I bought \\"The Golden Compass\\" while waiting in the San Francisco Airport during a 9 hour layover.  I love reading children's books and the cover looked interesting.  However, I was unable to keep my eyes open and fell asleep until the announcer kindly woke me up to tell me I had to get on my plane.  Somehow the book ended up in the trunk of my car and remained there for about 2 years.  One cold night when I was stuck waiting to pick someone up, I went rummaging around in there and found it.  So I started reading.  I didn't stop reading until the next morning (well, despite the half hour when I hurriedly dropped my friend off and flew back to my house to keep reading).  I scoured the local bookstores for the two sequels the next day.<br /><br />The Golden Compass begins a trilogy that takes you through the mind and spirit of one brave and amazing little girl.  It explores spirituality, theology, \\"magic\\" (if you can call it that), and just the trauma and joy of growing up.  It's a beautiful beginning.  Overall, it is a story about growing up, about finding out what innocence really is, and about finding yourself.<br /><br />You will, however, need to buy all three books at one time.  You'll be left with more questions than answers after this one.  And, I'd have to say, this is a book for mature children.  I'm not saying a kid couldn't handle this, I'm saying it has to be a mature individual, one able to understand abstract concepts and ideas.  And one who is open to new ideas and ways of looking at things.  This trilogy could really scare some kids.  It reminded me a lot of when I read The Last Battle<br /><br />by C. S. Lewis.  I was in 5th grade.  Didn't quite scare me, I'd have to say, but shook me, deeply.  This book has the same quality.<br /><br />It's a fantastic adventure and any young person could identify themselves with Lyra or the other main characters.  A definate read for the mature young adult.
