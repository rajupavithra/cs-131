This book is so skewed right it makes Rush Limbaugh look like a Kennedy. <br />I just wish this guy would be honest about what his real agenda is: personal gain and ego gratification. His show is a joke and his obvious infatuation/obsession with Bill Clinton is disturbing. <br />I'm amazed that people actually buy this crap, it's so plainly obvious that Hannity is a hack. For instance, I'm not a fan of John Kerry, but he's been blabbing about a &quot;possible affair&quot; with an intern for weeks on his radio show. It turns out that there is absolutely no evidence of this, and that this unsubstantiated claim has caused a great amount of grief to the woman and her family. Imagine having people one the radio claiming something so sordid of you all over the radio without any facts. Of course, republicans have these dalliances all the time, but you never hear about them from Hannity. He's a shill, plain and simple.<br />Don't waste your money.
I'm a big fan of the show ob BBC America, and I was very excited to get this book.<br />While I enjoyed this book and agree with everyone else that it's a good start it seemed to be lacking in a lot of meat. The examples they have are so obvious one would have to be blind not to know it looks ridiculous. There are also a lot of sweeping generalizations that didn't sit well with me. It misses the chance to really overcome subtle fashion disasters and it made me realize that one fashion doesn't always have to go with one body type. <br />Still it was intersting and entertaining to read, and I don't regret buying it.
Yes! <br />We return the brooding town of Clanton for a thriller with heart that reminds me of the passion that made A Time to Kill and The Firm such great books. <br />Danny Padgitt gets released from prison a mere 10 years after getting a &quot;life&quot; sentence, and members of the original jury are starting to drop like flies. <br />If you're like me you felt a steady decline in Grisham's writing since his first few novels. It was almost like he'd forgotten where he came from. He tried to redeem himself with Painted House and Bleachers, but I really couldn't get into them. There was a lot of heart in those books, but I didn't feel for the plot. There was a lot of plot in some of his later thrillers, but not a lot of heart. Finally we have both and it's a grand slam.
This book is the bible of American truth: The GOP are running this country into the ground.<br />Conason makes a strong case that most of the beliefs of the GOP are based on deception and lies. The strong evidence he offers, presented in a well thought out fashion, invites those who disagree to make a counter case based on something other than accusing him of being a liberal.<br />Conason points to several areas that the GOP offers often repeated sound bites that bare little resemblance to reality. His case about the GOP claiming to be a free market party is a case in point. Rather than letting the market rule as Barry Goldwater might have advocated, Conason offers case after case of Republicans choosing winners and losers, showering tax dollar largess on favored companies. Not surprisingly, these are more often than not companies that donate generously to the GOP.<br />The most powerful case in this book regards the Republicans growing and dangerous inclination to accuse any who disagree with them for being unpatriotic, or as in the case of a certain GOP mouth piece, of being traitors. This dangerous tendency towards demonization indicates a frightening willingness to damage democratic institutions in order to hold power. Not in this book but elsewhere Conason put it well when he said that the GOP increasingly seems to be a party not interested in governing, but in ruling.<br />Real Americans would do well to read and take note before casting their ballot in November.
Indigo wakes up completely naked and alone. She doesn't know where she is. Others some just appear and after some discussion they discover they have died and woken up in Heaven. Heaven has been destroyed by demons. A prophecy speaks of fours humans will come to regain Heaven. The surviving angels believe these humans are the ones spoken of in the prophecy. Problem: there's five of them, not four. One of the humans isn't who they seem. <br />Dinniman takes a huge risk with this book that could have failed miserably. It takes a lot of guts to write about heaven in such a way that mirrors the Christian heaven but also eviscerates all of the church's teachings at the same time. <br />Someone else mentioned Tom Clancy in their review. That is a very appropriate comparison. I would call this Tom Clancy with *heart* and compassion and genuine wonder and terror. This book starts as a story about a girl who is \\"lost\\" but eventually finds herself only after understanding what happened between herself and her father. <br />This very heart-wrenching story of one's relationship with their father is baked into this huge conflict of angels versus demons. While Indigo and her companions travel through what used to be heaven, another story unfolds and we meet several characters with several threads and storylines weaving together to create a rich tapestry. In the end this is a dual story of war. It's war on the biggest scale possible. (At one point there are trillions of demon and angel soldiers facing off in one of the best-handled battle scenes I've ever read in fantasy. Think the epic battle at the climax of Return of the King. Make it so the battle covers the entire country.) It's also about internal conflict. Every single character is struggling with something. This is where Dinniman flies above other genre writers. Had this been a book set in the civil war it'd be an Oprah book. <br />Well done and deserves my highest praise.
This wonderful book not only entertains but educates with tidbits of information about religion,history,cultural differences,geography, etc. I was mesmerized from the first page and hated to see the last page appear. Fix a cup of tea, curl up in a cozy spot and prepare to be enthralled.
Tyler delivers another literary tour-de-force about a \\"perfect\\" couple and their sad struggle through marriage.<br />This book really hit home for me not because of the story, which many other writers would turn into a snoozer but because of Tyler's amazing ability to write. If this was a book about someone just walking a dog, she'd find a way to make it interesting. <br />I'd really like this as a Oprah book.
After reading a marathon of Laymon, I think this one falls right in the middle. It's a typical horror/gore/mystery, and I think the biggest flaw is most of the characters are kinda hard to like. However, I was still pretty gripped throughout the entire thing. A must-read for people who like this author.
I first started reading this book and was so angry at the main character, March, that I put it down for about 6 months. I don't know what compelled me to pick it up again, but I ended up getting reeled in around the middle of the book. I really loved the descriptive nature of her writing. Many of the characters were really likeable and quirky. However, I felt like she left out more character development in the main characters. There was just no explanation as to why March behaved the way she did. Her daughter's thoughts and words were a little too sophisticated for a fifteen year old girl too. I found her writing to be enjoyable and would recommend this book to anyone to read. Just try not to get personally involved in March, she will make you want to rip her hair out!I found that a little hard to buy into. I also wished that she had written the last chapter. You really felt like you could picture the town, the people, etc. I think she must have been sick of writing and just turned in the script without finishing. I really felt absolutely no closure; there was no direction I was sure to imagine the ending would head. Still,
Magic realism plus rich, beautiful latin culture combines to make a beautiful novel of a town's history. So many wonderfully impossible things happen that this was just a treat to read, even during the heart wrenching moments. I think it's one of the riskier books for Oprah's club, but I can't wait to see what people say. Splendid!
A great read!<br />I truly enjoyed reading this It's a rarity these days to find an author capable of such good storytelling. The story is well written and very engaging, and despite the fact that it lost some momentum in the middle, I found myself eagerly turning pages to find out what would happen next. All in all, though this is not quite a perfect novel, it comes close.
