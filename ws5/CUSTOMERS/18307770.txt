This was my first book I read by Mercedes Lackey and the only reason I picked it up cos of the Yaoi content and I heard it was like the Nightrunner series by Lynn Flewelling. I never regret buying it.<br /><br />The main difference is this book actually has a couple in the first book! Unlike Nightrunner that took 3 books for them to get together at last.<br /><br />This book was marvelous. It was so moving and I couldn't help crying along with Vanyel's heart-wrenching loss to his unwanted gain. The writing style is beautiful and even if the whole lifebond was 'quick' it didn't matter because it was love at first sight for Tylendel and Vanyel.<br /><br />It's a book that follows Vanyel's life with his problems with his father and brother to when he is taken up by his Aunt and falls in love with her Protege, the blond Tylendel (an open gay himself). Vanyel realizes he is in love with another boy and tries to deal it but slowly they become lifebonded and a horrible incident occurs that changes their happiness forever when Tylendel commits suicide. Now stuck with legendary Mage and Herald powers because of the sudden incident, he wants no part in any of it and wants nothing more then to be reunited with his soulmate, Tylendel.<br /><br />Ignore the people who gave this book bad reviews because it is on my top 10 list to read.
Alright, well, I saw this Manga in my library and I thought I'd borrow it, to read it and boarden my horizans of different genres because I'm a Shonen Ai and Yaoi Fan.<br /><br />This book was rated 13 TEEN and let me tell you, if you think this is a cute little kiddy story it's not! Not only is it [...], featuring a woman with [...], girls showing their [...] in almost every shot they can get away with, there's almost no plot too. It isn't even funny, just increiably stupid.<br /><br />It's trully is a horrid Manga. If your a fan of Bishonen, stay away from this one! There is none and no Yaoi!

Usually a Shonen Ai and Yaoi fan I decided to try a different genre and I wasn't impressed with this Shoujo Title. A young girl being gropped by all her school mates, talking about her period and always in a swimsuit? Not to my liking. I put it down after reading 20 or so pages. No real Bishonen, seriously try Yaoi, this Shoujo genre has nothing to offer to what I've seen.
One of the only enlighting things I found out about this Manga was it has a 'scratch and sniff' cover, which smells like Strawberry Shortcake (which smells so yummy!) but the overall story and art is it's downfall. I read about 20 pages and got bored, so I'm selling it online. There is no depth to the characters and no real engaging plot. There is only some Slash and Shonen Ai parts for fans, but it won't satisfy a Yaoi Fan. I suggest looking out for Cafe Kichijouji.
Art is one thing that throws me off a Manga. And the art is horrible. Though alot more graphic then the Anime (which is upsetting), I think the Anime wins hands down. The Manga is lacking in a few things and it's confusing but still worth it for a Fan of Yaoi.

Well what to say? This is my first Western 'Manga' or 'Graphic Novel' (as many refer to them as, its still a Manga) anyway, apart from being printed Left-to-Right (something I'm not used to) it was an alright read, though deffiently not one of my favourites.<br /><br />Kingdom of Selfish Love is what the preview says, and in my opinion the boys are too girlie and this is even stressed when they happen to 'do it' they have no bits and look like twelve year olds. Even Japanese Shonen Ai has more action in my opinion.<br /><br />The extra story is worse, (and in worse I mean terrible and horrible) I bought this book for Yaoi! And its a story about a man who is turned in a woman by a genie and we have a graphic image of a hetero sex. Not my idea of Yaoi. Then he changes back to a man and has sex with his master again, and changes back to woman in the bed and we get more of view of a woman named then him! Don't buy this book if your not liking seeing naked chicks (I AM NOT ONE OF THOSE PPL!)<br /><br />[...]<br /><br />So yeh think what you may, but this title won't put me off buying other Western Yaoi. And it depends how you se it too.

I got this as a gift and I was so happy when I found them! I'm so glad that now even Tarot Cards are waking up to the Gay Pride theme and finally towards the male community. Though a female and lover of gay men (not the female counterpart) I throughly enjoy using these as my first deck of Tarot Cards. There is no nudity, the pictures are lovely. I highly recommended these.
So far DMP's only good Yaoi Manga released, though it really only is Shonen Ai (has kisses, nothing more). It features a beautiful story about two boys realizing their love for one another with the help of rings, which someone gives a matching ring to a person they love the boys realize they have the same ring. This one is a deffient buy.
This is my all time favorite series - even though it's only Shonen Ai it is the greatest Manga Series out there. The art is great and the story is funny and sweet in a lot of places, especially when it reveals how much the two main characters care for one another. It focuses on Dee Laytner and his persistence to get into the pants of his new partner Ryo Maclean, your average uke not knowing what to make of Dee's advances and Dee isn't the only one after Ryo, their new boss Berkley Rose is and Dee has his own admirers including one hyperactive jealous JJ, who hates Ryo. This is a must have series for any Yaoi or Shonen Ai Fan!
This is a nice older Yaoi Manga released by Kitty Media. Though it is very censored there is enough lovely dirty pillow talk to keep Yaoi Fans happy. Almost every page there seems to be no plot what so ever except `I'll give you a night of pleasure to stay at your house for the night' and it all seems to be made up of boinking. All the chapters are a lovely read for any Yaoi Fan.

This is a little late but hey, if you want nice big piccy of half naked men then buy now! Their are all hot men half dressed for those of you a little embrassed about seeing genitals. It is a great 2005 calender with plenty of space for writing in dates and things.

Another of DMP's Yaoi Manga, it's not like most Yaoi Manga having the teacher as the Uke and the student as the Seme. It wasn't necessarily DMP's fault for my low rating of this Yaoi Manga but it simply the fact was I disliked it. The art didn't catch me and neither did the story. So if you are a true Yaoi Fan get it but if you only collect the good stuff, pass by this one. After all, two of the main characters get girlfriends and that's not my cup of tea when I prefer reading boys boinking.
I agree with other reviewers, I bought this Manga and it's 2nd Volume for the hinted boyxboy moments and there were little to none in the first volume and was more Shoujo in the way of things. I don't think it was worth what I bought them for because I am a Shonen Ai and Yaoi collector. Get it if you have spare cash, but otherwise don't bother because what other ppl say, it's not really that great at the least the first volume isn't. I mean both boys keep refering to 'love' of girls. And that's not what any Yaoi Fan.

I thought plainly and simply - what the hell? I loved Fake to death but this is stupid. I know alot of people liked this story but it is totally out there. I disliked it terribly.<br /><br />The main protangist turns into a woman under a full moon, once a month that's 12 times a year. But the story only focuses when the chararcter is female, what about the rest of the time and year? Then they get married. The male and female couple. He will be a male 95% of the time yet this is almost ignored.<br /><br />This is not for any Yaoi Fan. Its silly.

I didn't really enjoy this Manga Series though I bought it. It was sweet and funny but didn't float my boat. The art is one thing that always throws me off - and believe me if your the same don't go for this book. The main character looks to much like a chick for my liking but still he always seems to prove he is male. The only 'older' Shonen Ai - Yaoi Manga I go for is Kizuna. Trust me, go for Kizuna. But it's totally your decision.

This Guide is alot bigger then the last 2 for the other Devil May Cry Guides, and helps alot more. It has pictures to drool over of Dante and Vergil as well where secrets are located and in depth boss battles. It helps getting through tuff missions and where to find all those blue orbs. This Guide also comes with a bonus fold-out for all of Dante's avaliable moves in each of his classes. So this is a must get for any fan of Devil May Cry, either for help or like me for the gorgeous pictures of Dante, with the bonus of Vergil, Dante's older twin brother. It's true what they say, Sparta's twin sons have differences to work out and it'll be an all out Bishonen Brawl with Dante vs Vergil. Get seats today ^__^
Though alot of people don't like the art - don't take this into consideration. There is alot of yummy Yaoi bits (lol most of the book really...) to enjoy and you end up feeling sorry for the way Ranmaru treats Kei, but then again if it was like how I wanted it, it would be PWP. I don't like the idea of Kai ruining all the good bits between Kei and Ran but then again it's better then some annoying chick they usually have in Yaoi Anime and Manga (yay! a lovely change!) he should be with Masa. Buy and support this amazing genre!
This is Kitty Media's first official Yaoi Manga released, the latest being Level C. The art work is beautiful, the story fantastic. By the end your edging Mari to finally get it on with Yu and geuss what? ~_^ I'll let you geuss. This is a must have for any Yaoi Fan because it is simply Superb.

I bought this after falling in love with the Hellsing Anime Series (though it was a little short, but luckily the OVA series is coming out in Japan soon) I bought the Manga. I must say I preferred the Anime as it didn't have a panty shot or anything but it was still an alright story cos Alucard is one sexy vampire. The Manga is very different to the Anime and vise-versa, it depends which one you read or watch first to which one you like. So buy and try.
I love Golden Cain, it's PWP with a plot - there is. He is upset over loosing his brother and finds comfort in Cain but finds out there is more to the Cain's past then a pretty face.<br /><br />The art is beautiful, the story is beautiful and most of its full of smut!!<br /><br />SO what is everyone's problem? (I only mean a select few really) We, the Yaoi Fans, wanted Yaoi translated into English and all I see is a bunch of spoil sports who just reply saying it's crap. You want Yaoi now we have it! Stop complaining! I love every Yaoi manga that is released and you should be glad!
To many friggin' chicks in this series, it is NOT anything like Eerie Queerie which at least had Shonen Ai. This Manga had 3 guys swooning over chicks - not something for ANY Yaoi fan.
This was my first book I read by Mercedes Lackey and the only reason I picked it up cos of the Yaoi content and I heard it was like the Nightrunner series by Lynn Flewelling.

It focuses on Dee Laytner and his persistence to get into the pants of his new partner Ryo Maclean, your average uke not knowing what to make of Dee's advances and Dee isn't the only one after Ryo, their new boss Berkley Rose is and Dee has his own admirers including one hyperactive jealous JJ, who hates Ryo. This is a must have series for any Yaoi or Shonen Ai Fan!
I didn't really enjoy this Manga Series though I bought it. It was sweet and funny but didn't float my boat. The art is one thing that always throws me off - and believe me if your the same don't go for this book. The main character looks to much like a chick for my liking but still he always seems to prove he is male. The only 'older' Shonen Ai - Yaoi Manga I go for is Kizuna. Trust me, go for Kizuna. But it's totally your decision.

This Guide is alot bigger then the last 2 for the other Devil May Cry Guides, and helps alot more. It has pictures to drool over of Dante and Vergil as well where secrets are located and in depth boss battles. It helps getting through tuff missions and where to find all those blue orbs. This Guide also comes with a bonus fold-out for all of Dante's avaliable moves in each of his classes. So this is a must get for any fan of Devil May Cry, either for help or like me for the gorgeous pictures of Dante, with the bonus of Vergil, Dante's older twin brother. It's true what they say, Sparta's twin sons have differences to work out and it'll be an all out Bishonen Brawl with Dante vs Vergil. Get seats today ^__^
Though alot of people don't like the art - don't take this into consideration. There is alot of yummy Yaoi bits (lol most of the book really...) to enjoy and you end up feeling sorry for the way Ranmaru treats Kei, but then again if it was like how I wanted it, it would be PWP. I don't like the idea of Kai ruining all the good bits between Kei and Ran but then again it's better then some annoying chick they usually have in Yaoi Anime and Manga (yay! a lovely change!) he should be with Masa. Buy and support this amazing genre!
This is Kitty Media's first official Yaoi Manga released, the latest being Level C. The art work is beautiful, the story fantastic. By the end your edging Mari to finally get it on with Yu and geuss what? ~_^ I'll let you geuss. This is a must have for any Yaoi Fan because it is simply Superb.
It wasn't necessarily DMP's fault for my low rating of this Yaoi Manga but it simply the fact was I disliked it. The art didn't catch me and neither did the story. So if you are a true Yaoi Fan get it but if you only collect the good stuff, pass by this one.

I bought this after falling in love with the Hellsing Anime Series (though it was a little short, but luckily the OVA series is coming out in Japan soon) I bought the Manga. I must say I preferred the Anime as it didn't have a panty shot or anything but it was still an alright story cos Alucard is one sexy vampire. The Manga is very different to the Anime and vise-versa, it depends which one you read or watch first to which one you like. So buy and try.
I love Golden Cain, it's PWP with a plot - there is. He is upset over loosing his brother and finds comfort in Cain but finds out there is more to the Cain's past then a pretty face.<br /><br />The art is beautiful, the story is beautiful and most of its full of smut!!<br /><br />SO what is everyone's problem? (I only mean a select few really) We, the Yaoi Fans, wanted Yaoi translated into English and all I see is a bunch of spoil sports who just reply saying it's crap. You want Yaoi now we have it! Stop complaining! I love every Yaoi manga that is released and you should be glad!
To many friggin' chicks in this series, it is NOT anything like Eerie Queerie which at least had Shonen Ai. This Manga had 3 guys swooning over chicks - not something for ANY Yaoi fan.
