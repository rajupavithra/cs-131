Santeria the Beliefs and Rituals of a Growing Religion in America is a well written book, but to be honestly it has all been written before.   Nothing really new and if you already have two or three books on Santeria, then you are sure to have all the information that is within this book.  The chapters are as follows.  <br />Santeria What is it?  This goes into giving you a general idea of what Santeria is, a description of it's followers and members, a small description of it's initiations.  It explains the Energy Ashe, and the Eggungun. \\"The Dead Ancestors.\\"   <br />Chapter Two; gives you a few versions of the Patakis, \\"Folklores or Legends\\" of the Creation of the World.  Other legends such as the Flood is also within this section.  There are a few Charts within this section.  One for the many names of God.   A comparison chart of the Orishas with Roman and Greek Gods.  A chart describing each Orishas major influence. Colors of the Orishas.  Most Likely Children of the Orishas.   And another chart on the Orishas and their Catholic Identities. (Saint Paths)  <br />Chapter Three, is a description of the Major Orishas, their attributes and their Patakis \\"Legend\\".   Of the Orishas included are the major, Obatala, Eleggua, Oggun, Ochosi, Ochun, Chango, Yemaya, Aganju, Orunla, Osain, Babalu Aye, Oya, Orisa Oko, Osun, Inle, Obba and the Ibeji.  Each gets a quick discription, and a legend, which really reminded me of Migene Gonzales Wippler's earlier works.   <br />In this chapter are more charts.  Each deducted to a particular Orisha and their many \\"caminos\\" their avatars, roads or paths.   <br />Chapter 4 gives you a quick description or ceremonies and rituals, Bembe, Ilekes, Asiento, Ebbos and so on.  Oh and more charts.  (Days and Numbers of the Orishas) (Food offering for the Orishas) (Medical Properties of some plants) The author went a little chart crazy with this book.  Again if you have two books on Santeria, you will not learn anything new.   <br />Chapter 5 touches quickly on Oracles used within Santeria.  The Coco, the 16 Caracoles, Cowrie Shells, and the Table of Ifa.  Oh and we can't forget the Chinese Numerology.  Yep you read that correctly.  Chinese Numerology.    <br />Chapter 6 and 7 gets boring with the History, and Roots.  But if you have never picked up a book on Santeria and this is your first, then it is informative and you will learn something new.  Again if you already have books on Santeria, trust me you have read it before. <br /> All in all the book is not a bad book if it is your first book on the Basic of Santeria.  The religion is a beautiful experience, one you can not learn through any book.  But I kind of wish that authors of Santeria books would right a bit more of their personal experiences, give us some flavor.   <br />I recommend this book to those who never read a ook on this beautiful and mysterious religion.  But to those who are initiated or have other books on Santeria, trust me it has all been said over and over and over again.
Mr Huson is a Genius in my eyes.  Mastering Witchcraft has nothing to do with Religious Witchcraft movements, it has nothing to do with Karma or the Three Fold Law, in fact it has nothing to do with the New Age Witchcraft movement of modern times.  This book does not hold its punches back, the book is well balanced with both positive and negative magic, what New Agers label as Black and White Magic.   <br />I am a big fan of Mr. Huson's work and enjoy his other books and novels.  \\"The Offering\\" is a must read for those who want a Horror based on African Macumba (Vodou) magic, laced with Santeria.   <br />But this by far has to be one of my favorite books of all time.  While more receant books on Witchcraft have to do with Religion, and Karma, Mastering Witchcraft has to do with the ancient art of Witchcraft, leaving the religion aspect out of it.  There is one part of the book though that made me laugh a bit.  The \\"Our Father\\" backwards.  Being Hispanic a Santero, Espiritista and a Brujo I often use the old Padre Nuestro, \\"Our Father\\" as is, because in itself it is a very powerful prayer in working Magic as are may Psalms.  But besides the Our Father backwards, this is your choice if you use it backwards or not, the book is a must have for all Witches. <br /> Many people ask me if I could recommend an English book on Brujeria as practiced by Hispanics, well this is as close to brujeria as you can get.  Many people who gave it a negative are basically Wiccans.  I respect Wiccans I just hope that they someday realize that all that is Witchcraft does not make it Wicca.  One Wiccan reviewer talked like a Christian when he stated.  \\"The Book tells you that in order to practice Witchcraft you have to sell your soul-- and that the book never tells you to whom.  Basically as a Brujo we are taught that God rules over all things, Negative and Posative, Good or Bad.  When you decide to practice Magic and Witchcraft you are in a sense selling your soul.  Or dedicating your Soul.  If you are a Christian Witch you sell your Soul to Yhvh, if you practice Lukumi you sell your soul to your Ruling Orisha.  (Selling your soul is dedicating your soul.)  In the same if you are a Satanist you sell your Soul to Satan.  But all things are of God, evil and good.  So if Satan is of God, and you sell your Soul to Satan, you sell your Soul to God. <br /> Anyway this is a good book, a bit controversial, but a must read to all Occultists, Witches, and yes even modern day Warlocks, they exist in Spanish they are called Diableros. <br /> I someday hope Paul Huson one day writes a second book on the subject, but until then, check out his other great books.

Breathtaking, and Beautiful One of My Favorite & Treasured Book. <br /> Although I am not a Christian or Jewish, I have always had a great respect for the Book of Psalms and always use them for daily meditation and contemplation.  So I was thrilled when by accident I cam across this beautiful book.  From the first page to the last, the artwork is amazing, touching and uplifting.  The book has a feel of an old mysterious tomb of days long gone.  It was so beautiful that I purchased a few as gifts.   <br /> <br /> My greatest respects goes to the late James S. Freemantle for he truly was inspired by something out of this world.  What touched me more, was that the book was inspired by love, the love of a man for his wife, and because of her \\"Clara\\" which is Spanish for Clarity (Ti See Clearly) James S. Freemantle saw and was inspired with the Clarity of Angels.   <br /> <br /> Each page is breathtaking, and it truly does inspire one to read the psalms.  This book has become one of my most favorite and most treasured books, and one does not have to be neither Christian nor Jewish to appreciate the beauty of this book.  If you are Spiritual, or follow any other Spiritual or Religious Faith, I have to recommend you get this book, it is truly Breathtaking.   <br /> <br />
This is a very beautiful deck, the images are very beautiful, and although I like them very much I am not sure if I will be using them for giving readings.  The cards are regular size, but the coating on the deck is a bit weak, when I shuffled the deck after a few times, I accidentally bent one, this has never happened to me with one of my other decks that have a stronger coating.   <br /> Again I do like the art, and it is a nice deck, but as far as giving readings with them, for some reason it does not grab me.  Some of the images are very dull, and the cards are beautiful but they do not flow well with each other, and it seams like you are using a few different decks instead on one deck.    <br /> The box that holds the kit is nice, but again be careful how you open the box when you get it, I wrapped mine trying to get the wrap of.   In the box you get a nice book, which was well written, and a smaller box that holds the deck.  The Box is like has a ribbon, because it is not a traditional box, but one similar to a binder, you place the deck within and tie the golden ribbon to keep it closed.  It is a good idea and keeps you deck within as long as it is laying flat, but it is not a good box to carry around with you, because the cards easily slide out.  (I gotta give the creators credit for an original idea though.)  <br />I would recommend it as a collectable, and for those who have knowledge with the RW Tarot, but as an actual reading deck, well it just did not do it for me.   <br />
I have to say that again Esmeralda Santiago touched my heart, and not in the way that she did with, \\"When I Was Puerto Rican.\\"  I do not think, \\"but I hope\\", she could duplicate that magic.  But this book is the third installment of her Memoirs, and while the magic of her childhood can still be seen in some minor parts of the book, The Turkish Lover heads into a different direction.   <br />The book is based around her the age of 21 to 28 and her rocky relationship with a much older man.  The book was a page turner and I could not put it down for a second.  Esmeralda writes with such passion and feeling, that deep within your soul, you feel her pains and joys, for me she write like no other author has.  I have waited for a long time for another of her books, and the wait is over, and I can truly say I am not disappointed.   <br /> If you have never read any of her books, and to get a deeper understanding for this book, I highly recommend picking up her first book, \\"When I Was Puerto Rican.\\"  Follow that with \\"Almost a Woman\\" and then go and read, \\"The Turkish Lover.\\"   I am sure you will become hocked and become an instant fan, and after reading all three of those books and you wish to read more of her work, pick up, \\"America's Dream A Novel.\\"   <br /> I was very fortunate enough to have gotten the chance to receantly meet Esmeralda Santiago in a book signing for this book, and she has much planned for another trilogy of books based on a Rural Peasant Family from Puerto Rico, the book is to span a few generations, starting in the 1800's, and ending in present, so that will be a great read. <br /> For you die hard fan's of Esmeralda, such as myself, she is planning on writing more about the earlier lives of her Father and Mother.  And if you are a fan of her work, especially \\"When I Was Puerto Rican\\" you probably feel in love with her Father, and want to know more of this mysterious but yet lovable and wise man.   <br /> I can not recommend this book so much, It is agreat book, beautiful, poetic, inspiring, thrilling, sad, and just lovely, and it is Puerto Rican Food for the Soul.
This set is not worth 15.95, and I highly recommend those that are interested in learning a form of Fortune Telling to look elsewhere.  What you are basically spending your money is on a nicely made Box, because the deck is just a regular playing deck that you can get anywhere for around 1 dollar.  The Book, even though a re-printing of an old book, is horrible.  And sometimes things that are old should be forgotten.  The answers are ridiculous.   <br /> <br />The format is quit simple, that any 7 year old kid could follow.  It gives you an out line of how readings would go.  Example.  Does He Like Me?  Shall I be sought after?  What is My Greatest Attribute?  And So Forth.  Then the answers are ridicules.  \\"Yes\\" \\"No\\" Maybe\\" \\"Today's Lost\\" Honestly I kept getting reminded of the Magic 8 Ball that you shake and the answer appeared in the little blue window.   <br /> <br />If you want interested in Divination learn from a cheap Rider Wait Tarot, and you can find books afordable relating to the Rider Wait anywhere.  If you want to learn Fortune Telling, \\"Gypsy\\" style, skip this and pick up any regular Deck of Cards, and check out the book Fortune Telling with Playing Cards by Sophia.  Also the Fortune Teller's Deck by Jane Lyle is way better.   If it is the Gypsy that got your attention to this item.. Check out Raymond Buckland's The Buckland Gypsy Fortune Telling Deck.  Any of those can be purchased here at Amazon.com and are way better.   <br />
When we hear the words Hoodoo, or Voodoo, most people automatically think of Zombies and Voodoo Dolls. And while many people try to hide it, \\"Yes these things do exist\\" these things are not what Hoodoo or Voodoo is completely about. I have been initiated into Santeria. But all my life I was raised and grew up in Puerto Rican Brujeria and Espiritismo. There is one thing that is common with Brujeria and Hoodoo. The practitioners of both paths come from various religious traditions, but both Los Brujos and the Hoodooists are consulted on things both Good and Bad. This is one thing that is greatly missing in this book. <br />  <br /> I enjoyed the book immensely, but I felt there was so much missing, when I saw who the publisher was, \\"LLewelyn\\" it all came clear. Stephanie Rose Bird is a good author, and the book read well. It is a combination of Luisah Tesh's great book Jambalaya and the various Ray Malbrough books, <br />  <br /> I felt she could have taken the book some place else. The recipes for making oils, and Four Thieve Vinegar, have been published before. There is so much more to Hoodoo than just these typical things, which Llewelynn allows its authors to write about. <br />  <br /> Although I am not giving the book five stars, because most of the stuff is written elsewhere, I have to give Stephanie some credit for being informative, and I learned a few things, that I had not known.  <br />  <br /> This book is defiantly not only about Hoodoo, it is a mixture of Vodou, Santeria, Candomble, Brujeria and so forth. But unlike other authors who have done a messy job in trying to put the four-mentioned together, Stephanie really places them together nicely. In a way that is Very Brujeria, and yes we can even say, \\"Modern Day-Hoodoo.\\" <br />  <br /> For those who are interested in adding some Hoodoo into their practices, and have little knowledge, this is a good start. But my advice to Stephanie.  <br />  <br /> &quot;Girl the way you write, has an honest feel, andI know you have more to teach than what your Current Publishers allow. Go to Original Publications, or another company, where you can really let people know what Hoodoo is truly about.&quot;
As a fan pf the Rider Waite Tarot, I was always looking for a classy deck, that had an old feel to it, with the images used in the RWT.  After searching high and low, and many disappointments I finally came upon the Golden Tarot. <br /> <br />This is truly an amazing deck, the art work (a collage of Renaissance Paintings) is beautiful, and looking at the deck carefully you would never think they were collages, they look as if they were painted that way. <br /> <br />The edges of the Deck are Gold, like those old bibles Grandma us to have, the size of the deck is standard, and are a little ruff at first, but with use they become more comfortable.  This is one of those decks that are going to look better as it ages.  When you give people readings, this is the deck that gets remarks of how beautiful they are.  For the really affordable price, this is one of those decks you have to add to your collection. <br /> <br />For those who work with the RWT, this deck will be very easy to interpret, as the images are very familiar.  I highly recommend this deck.  Great Job Kat, this deck surly deserves the title as one of the most beautiful. <br />
Destined to be a classic. The Only Book on Spells You Will Ever Need.<br />This Book is not a Book on \\"Wiccan Magick\\" , although Wiccans who are not fluff bunnies, and are more open mided to learning could use it, and benefit greatly from this Book.    It is a book on Folk Magic, from Brujeria, Santeria, Espiritismo, From Latin America, To Egypt, and other ancient cultures,  from around the world.   Many of these Earth-Magico Cultures do not believe in the concept of \\"Karma\\" so many of these Spells would be shunned by Wiccans.  With that said..  I Love this Book.    I hope the Author does a similar book on Magical Ceremonies and Rites and Passages.  <br />There are little books of spells, cheap book of spells, and so so book of spells, well this is the Ultimate Huge Tome of Spells. An Encyclopedia of Magical Spells from around the world, this book defiantly belongs in every Witches bookshelf. Over 1000 pages of spells, baths, infusions, the spells range from everything from Santeria, Strega, Vodou, Spiritism, Brujeria, Shamanism, and traditional Witchcraft. Unlike other spell books, this will defiantly be of great usage to its owner. One of the best Book of Shadows ever printed. The Tome, because it is Huge has everything from Banishing, Cleansings, Baths, Protection Spells. Everything from Seances, to calling on Spirits of Nature, from White Magic, to Black Magic, and everything in between. Here is a preview of the table of context. <BR>Spell casting, - Ritual and Tools, - Animal Spells - Banishing Spells - Business Success Spells - Cleansing Spells, - Court case, Legal, Justice Spells - Death Spells (Yes there is much on Black Magic, for those weak of heart) Ghost, Necromancy, and Vampire Spells. - Divination Spells - Domination, Influence Spells - Dream, Astral, Nightmare Spells- The Evil Eye - Fertility Spells - Safety Spells - Gamblers Spells, and Charms - Happy Home Spells - Healing Spells - Hexes and Curses - Invisibility, and Transformation spells - Love andSeduction Spells - Luck Spells - Marriage and Divorcee Spells, - Money, Wealth, Prosperity and financial spells - Children Spells - Protection Spells - Psychic powers - Summoning Spirits - unblocking spells - weather spells, and trust me, so much more... <BR>A person would have to spend allot of money, on many books and still would not get half of what this book has to offer. <BR>I have to give much praise to Judika Illes; this book will defiantly be one I will use for many years. This is my first book by this author, and know I have to purchase her other works. But I can not recommend this TOME enough, it is defiantly a must have for all Witches, and brujos. For all that you get in this huge book, the price is excellent, and very affordable. The Spells are simple and traditional spells that were used by our ancestors and are still effective today. No where will you get a book like this. If I could give this book 10 stars, I would.
I purchased the Sweep series for my 13 year old daughter in the hopes that maybe she would read.  \\"She hated to read.\\"  Well I was amazed, and could not get her to go to sleep, as she would spend the whole night, with a night-light on reading these books.  She enjoyed them so much, and could not stop talking first about Cal and then Hunter, that I had to see what all the fuss was about.<BR>Well after two weeks, a book a day, for a girl who hated to read, it sparked my curiosity, so I started reading, and was surprised to find out how enjoyable a Teen book about Teen Witches could be.  I am not really into Wicca, but these books are really enjoyable.  I am on my fifth book, and my daughter read each twice, and is know on the Circle of Three Series.  I have to highly recommend these books to those parents who can not get their daughters to read.  These are excellent stories, full of fantasy, horror, and fun.

I read the reviews on this book, and although I had Mr Leremy's other books, and was not impressed much, I though, well let me pick it up.  Well for the price, I guess it is okay, but honestly I have read better, else where and most of the prayers you can get of the internet, or in a better book also published by Original Products titled, Selected Prayers.  Anyway, the book will have most of the public confused especially, although there is a nice section on prayers for La Madama, El Congo, and Dr Jose Gregorio Hernandez, unless you practice Brujeria and Espiritismo, these spirits will not be familiar to you.  I though he should have added a bit more back ground on each spirit.<br />II found one part really disrespectful, the whole section on, \\"Beware of Gypsies\\"  Wow, I was very offended as my Grandmother was a Gypsi, una Gitana from Spain, and she was a very strong, spiritual and important figure in my life. Trust me I have been initiated into Lukumi, there are as many shady Santeros, as there are good ones.  I am surprised I did not burn the book after that ridiculous section.  Also what is up with the whole, \\"You have to do it this way, approach the book has.<br />This book is okay, did not learn much, as most of the rituals in the book, I learned while watching my Mom, and Aunt, and even my Padrino and Madrina when I was younger.  If you want a better book on the subject, honestly I would go for, Spiritual Cleansing: A Handbook of Psychic Protection, by Draja Mickaharic which is about the same price probably a few bucks more, but trust me, you will get more and learn a whole lot.
Simple little book, really more for beginners as the Spells are frankly speaking very simple to do, and not very complex.  Mostly Brujeria and Hoodoo spells involving spells  such as. bothersome neighbor move away spell.  To Control a Bothersome Neighbor.   To discover the Identity of an Occult Enemy.   Although the booklet, because it is not much of a book, \\"it only contains about 42 pages\\" it is a Simple Spellbook. Aimed for the beginners in mind.  There are some Incantations.  And I quote the book in one of its incantations. <br />\\"For them that stealeth, or borroweth and returneth, not this book, from it's owner let the book change into a serpent in their hands, and sting him.  Let book worms gnaw their entrails............... \\"   And so on, and so on...<br /> This booklet it not very Wicca friendly, but for those young Hoodoo, and Brujos, it is a nice little spell book, for the brujos who have practiced for a long time, these spells should be known buy heart, and thus the book would not be very helpful, unless having it as a small little refrence or research book.  Still, very simple, and safe, and I usually give a copy or recomend it for the young Brujos, who have some interest in simple spells.  <br />Spells included, Hexes, Curses, Protection, Court Case, Protection from Thieves, Stop Gossip, Avoid Accidents, Against Slander.  The Booklet it 42 pages, and each page has a spell, charm or a Mojo bag = 42 spells.  No history, theory, or authors experiences, just a simple Spell book.  I do recommend it for those who are looking for their first Spell book, for more experienced practitioners.  \\"Been there, done that, save your money..
This is an excellent Formulary, but I do not mean to bust any ones bubble, but most of the formulas are not complete.  The formulas are based on those traditionally used in Santeria, Brujeria and Voodoo, \\"New Orleans Voodoo\\"  and as a Brujo I often make most of these formulas myself for my clientel, but although many are complete to a point, many are missing major ingredients, that any experienced Brujo would know.  But as a formulary it is good, I like it, found it helpful, one of the best of it's kind.  But still the book is missing the proper way of making the formulas, the proper time, and prayer or chant, the best day, time, and Moon phase in which to make them.  And also many are missing Key Ingredients, especially in the Powder Department, as well as the Oil section.  What Oil, \\"Key Oil\\" would one use.  \\"Usually a Pure Virign Olive Oil.  And the Powders, most have all the ingredients, but what you will get is a mixture of a bunch of herbs, not actually a Powder.  Without those essential key ingredients to make them a Powder.  They would work great in conjure bags, mojo, and so forth.  And since I know most of what is missing.  I find it still to be a great book.<br />Also most of the Powders, and Formulary in general, do waver from both Black and White Magic.  Something that will turn of the Wiccan community.  But for Brujos, and Santeros, this is a great book.  The only problem, as I have stated.  It's Like Making Chicken Soup without the Chicken or the Broth.
Do not let the cover fool you on this Book..  It shows all the basic tools of Wicca.  This is not a book really for Wiccans, as it does get on the Dark side.  I am one who loves all of Tarostars books, well the two that I have anyway.  This book is excellent for those in Hoodoo, Voodoo, Bruejria, Curanderia and Santeria.  <br />The way it is written and the Spells in the back remind me of the old time spells, used in Latin America.  Some Cursing Spells, with a little Hexing and Protection.  The oil section, is good.  I was not to crazy about the floor washes, as this is not the way I personally do them.  Actually not even close.  But the rest of the book is a great little read.  I recommend this book to all those Brujos, who do not fear Karma, like Christians Fear the Devil.   I would also put a sticker on this Book.  \\"Advisory Some Black Magic Included.\\"
I come across allot of people who ask me about those Spanish herb used in Santeria or Brujeria, or the herbs sold in the Botanica Shops, with the Spanish names like. Rompe Zaraguey, Pica Pica, or Quita maldicion. These are popular herbs used in the ancient rights of Santeria, Voodoo and Brujeria. But for those who do not speak Spanish, these herbs are almost impossible to identify. Finally a book that answers, not all but allot. but a good amount.<br />In this little book you will find a wealth of information, on the translation of those exotic herbs with Spanish names. You will also get traditional spells as done in the Caribbean. Finally a rode map book for the Herbal section of the Botanicas. A useful little book that is highly recommended.
First and foremost the author of the book ever mentiones Wicca or that she is Wiccan.  Only the words Witch and Witchcraft are used.  \<BR>Second, The spells presented hear are the traditional spells used in Brujeria, Voodooists, Espiritismo, Curanderismo, and Hecherismo, or Witchcraft. It seems sadly that books as this should have a label, like those found on cds. -- &quot;Witch's Advisory, No one under 18 or Wiccan Without a True Brujos Consent.&quot; --  These spells are the traditional spells used by many Witches, not Wiccans. If you are Wiccan do not read, if you are interested in true folk magick, spell crafting and Witchcraft as done by Brujos, then this might be a small but good window into the secret kitchen, altar and working room of a Bruja/o, Witch. <br />With all respects towards Wiccans, one must understand that throught the world this is what Witchcraft in.   In Countries such as Mexico, Puerto Rico and all through out the world, many people go to Brujos or Hechiseros seeking revenge for a wrong doing.  The Brujo will always warn.  \\"Becareful what one asks for.\\"  But the `trabajo\\"  the magickal working is done. <br />One should read this book with an open mind, as \\"so called Witch\\" one should have the proper understandings of both Black and White magick.  I am sure your mind would change, or you would run back to this book.  If lets say, and \\"God and Los Santos forbid\\" your mother was abused, your daughter was rapped, or you where cursed to ruins by a more powerful Witch who knew these knowledges.  <br />The Profession and Craft of a True Witch must completely understand the workings behind both Black and White Magick.  This book reveals these things.  <br />Although I do not personally use Black Magick to harm anyone, I must say I have had clients come to me, who have been \\"Enbrujado\\" Bewitched or Cursed.  So I must understand what was in the mind of the dark magician, what where his/her procedure.  These things can be found out in books like these.<br />Lastly this is traditional Witchcraft with the good and the bad.  This is not Fluffy, all is Happy, all is good, Wicca.  And it never states it is.

I have always loved the Rider Waite Tarot; it was my first tarot deck that I have ever owned.  But the colors of the original where always so boring.  Then Came the Universal Waite that had nice colors, but they just seemed so soft to me.  Then finally the Radiant Rider Waite comes along, with the classic images that we all know and love, and finally you see things in a whole new way.  Much Brighter, and yes you can say a little more Radiant.  This deck will be around for a long time.  <br />I love it and use it frequently.  The deck is standard Tarot size, same size as the Universal and regular Rider Waite.  The Back of the cards is a very nice Night Sky Blue filled with yellow stars.  The colors of the images are not really radiant, in the harsh sense of the word, but more vibrant.  If you look close, you can tell that the original images have been retouched, as many facial features have a slight difference.   The deck shuffles well, a little slippery, and the corners are smooth.  The card stock is flexible, but made to last; this deck will last many usages.  <br />There is one minor setback.  The smell of the cards, at times is to over whelming.  I have tried everything to get that factory smell out of them.  I have spoken to a few others who own the deck and they have the same problem.   Hopefully after many usages this weird aroma will leave.  <br />But beside that the deck is really good, it is defiantly my favorite of all the Rider Waite Clones.  I recommend it to all beginners and advanced tarot readers or collectors.  Nice deck for those who are just starting out.  The images on this deck are familiar and comforting.  Plus almost all books dealing with learning Tarot use Pamela Smith's images.  So this deck would make a great gift for yourself or for your loved ones.
This book was ridiculous, and very disappointing.  It has nothing to do with Brujeria or Curanderismo as practiced in Mexico.  It's about New Age Wicca, not Ancient Aztec Teachings.  The prayers about wands, and such where ridiculous, and the supposed information she got from Brujas notebook read more like a cheesy book of shadows, and nothing like what the contents of sacred libretas have.  <BR>This has nothing, to do with Brujeria as practiced in Mexico.  The altar diagram, as all know is a Wiccan altar, not a Brujas altar.  There is no mention of La Santisima Muerte, los Milagros charms, how sacred Copal is in brujeria practices, no mention of the importance of dreams, or the Nagual Spirits, or the traditional hechisos, and trabajos espirituales.  Save your money, if you want to learn about the ancient mother Goddess, Tonantzin I would highly recommend, the book.  \\"The Aztec Virgin\\" by John Mixi.   If you want another book on how Wicca has no true roots, and is steeling and disrespecting from every tradition and spiritual path in the world, then this petty book is for you.

I received this book during my \\"Iyaworaje' year in white, by one of my good friends and Abure \\"Spiritual Brother\\" within our Spiritual House.  This book is one of the most important books on Orisha Spirituality.  For the first time, the author does not reflect or even touch the subject of Orisha sacred items, numbers, and all that other stuff than is found in many Orisha books these days.  This gem of a book reflects on starting to honor the Orisha starting from within.   The book focuses on self-reflection, healing inner pains, honoring commitments, mindfulness, honesty, and other true wisdoms that our found in the teachings of religions such as Zen, Buddihsm, and Hinduism.  <BR>The book is written for the followers of the various Orisha traditions, but can be applied by any person no matter race, religion or sexual preference.   There is a small section on Orisa Soul work, which again can be applied by anyone.  A section on honoring ones Ancestors and creating a shrine for them.  <br />A most beautiful, and well-written book that does not dabble, with silly \\"how to do magic spells\\" or superstitions.  But instead teaches how to work with ones inner spirits, how to seek blessings from the divinities within, how to find peace through meditation with the mysteries of the Orisha tradition.  This book is a basic fundamental to the truth, beauty and wisdom that lie within the Orisha tradition.  <BR>I have to highly recommend this book to all newly initiated Iyawo, it will bring deeper blessings and meanings to your first year in white.  But I also have to recommend this book to all that are looking for their first book on Orisha Spirituality.  <BR>Bravo and Ashe!  To you Iyalosha Omilade, \\"Tobe Melora Correal\\" your book is important, groundbreaking, and will be forever listed under the greats such as John Mason, Chief Fama, and Iyanifa Ileana
Although I have to give many respects to Tayannah Lee, for writing a basics how to book on Rootwork, there was only one problem I had with the book.  Roots, are even hardly mentioned, with the exception of Devil's Shoestring, and High John Root.  Other roots used in Rootwork are not even covered such as Bat's Head, Adam and Eve Root, Osha root, and other roots, that are the reason why Rootwork is called Rootwork.  But besides this little fault, it is a handy little book for the beginners, or those who are interested in Hoodoo, Obeah, and other African Magickal traditions. <br />If you are interested in traditional ingredients used in mojo bags, gris gris, or Santeria's resguardos this is a good start.  As it goes behind the meaning of some of the ingredients such as human hair, nails bitts, clothing, and other ingredients that go into the making of these talismans.   There is an excellent introduction for using waters, dirts, and other ingredients found in nature.  Also a basic introduction on cartsomancy, since traditional rootworkers, and those who practice Voudou, Espiritismo, Umbanda and other African influenced traditions use either Spanish playing cards or a regular deck of cards.   If you purchase this book, and want further study, I also must highly recommend you purchase these three books, that go well with it.  Papa Jim's Herbal Workbook, by Papa Jim, Jambalaya the Natural Woman's book of Personal Charms by Luisah Teish, and Hoodoo Herb and Root Magic: A Materia Magica of African-American Conjure, by Catherine Yronwode<BR> <BR>Although it is a basic introduction, it is ground breaking, and much needed, I highly recommend it to those who want a simple understanding of how to use this ancient form of African American Magickal system.
This is one of those small but great gems that is not getting the recognition it is suppose to.  I first purchased the book in Spanish, and then got the English edition, and I have to say I found this book to be really informative and helpful.  Learn the ceremonial usages of Copal, Sweet Grass, Ritual Tobacco, Osha Root, White Sage, Cedar, Mugwort and Lavender.  Learn the historical and ritualistic usages for these plants as was used by the Wise Men and Woman of the various Indigenous tribes who used them, and passed on these wisdoms to the healers, spiritists, and witch doctors of modern time.<br />Traditionally in my Spiritist back ground we offer tobacco to our Spirit Guides and Ancestors, the book offers traditional prayers that can be used or adjusted a bit to work for your spiritual purposes.<br />I found the historical information very useful and informative.  One of those books that does not get the recognition it desreves.  It's Spanish edition has become quite the favorite to Curanderos, Brujos, and Santeros.  I highly recommend this small little wonder, Useful information.
One of the most, if not the most important book of Modern Curanderismo.  Lovely book, that is hard to place down, and belongs in every Healer's shelf.  Beautifully written, touching, and very informative.  The book teaches the importance of not just healing the body and mind, but also the soul.  As a Puerto Rican Espiritista and Santero, I have really appreciated the deep wisdom and body of knowledge that came from this book.  I Highly recommend this book.  The lessons learned can be applied by any healer or spiritual councilor, no matter what ones spiritual path or religion, or race may be.  The wisdom and knowledge that Elena Avila shares with her readers and students is invaluable.    <br />Well worth the money, and it is like having a wise sage or Curandera in your living room.  I hope to see future works by Elena Avila, as I believe she has a voice and knowledge that needs to be heard.   I am late commer to this book, and am happy to have had the chance to find it, and enjoy, brazo to you Seniora Elena Avila.  Luz, Progresso, y Caridad!
This is probably the first and single most important book on Puerto Rican Espiritismo and Brujeria (Witchcraft) as it is  practiced on the island.  The book does not just only give you an anthropological look into Brujeria, but also the history on how it probably started out on the Island as well as how Taino, African and Spanish Catholic influences has changed the face of Brujeria and Espiritismo in Puerto Rico.  <BR>The book also introduces Haydee, La Numero Uno Bruja de Loiza.  :The Number One Witch-Healer of Loiza, Puerto Rico.\\"  The author takes you into the mind of a modern bruja, and their practices.  It also gives you how Cuban Santeria and its pantheon of Orisha Spirits has been intermingled and embraced into its cosmology.  Topics on Curanderismo and Kardecian Spiritism are also spoken about.<BR>  This is an important book for all Puerto Rican who are looking for their identity within Espiritismo, Santeria, Curanderismo or Brujeria.  Haydee \\"may she rest in peace\\" may have lived a life that many have not approved on, she may have been a hypocrite to others, but she was honest, she had nothing to hide.  Not to the author of the book and especially not to any of it's readers. For that alone I enjoyed its sincearity, and I can Highly recommend this book.
The book reads like a really bad Hollywood Voodoo Movie.  First of all, this Heiki person speaks of Voodoo with the negative concepts that a person who has no proper knowledge would use.  Never is a Houngan, or Mambo mentioned.   Also all the information that this person knows of Voudou does not come from personal knowledge.  It comes from Jambalaya: The Natural Woman's Book of Personal Charms and Practical Rituals, by Luisah Teish.  Everything from illustrations to rituals where copied from this book.  Also the ritual calls used for the Lwa, are not Voodoo or Haitian for that matter.  They are Lukumi, a completely different system.  Also what does the Runes, Tantras, and all that other stuff have to do with traditional African Voudon.  I will spell it for you. N O T H I N G!! <BR>I could not believe how much this person got away with stripping other peoples materials, and then title the book Voodoo Rituals, a users guide.  When it has nothing to do with true Vodoun.  Dont waist your money on this.  If you have minimal knowledge in what you call, Voodoo I recommend the book I mentioned above by Luisah Teish, a book this Keiki person used without giving proper knowledge.  Just compare the two, the rituals and illustrations will speak for themselves.
I have been collecting and reading Tarot decks for as long as I can remember.  Usually I always ignored Oracle decks as they are in a completely different structure than what is a traditional Tarot Deck.  But when I first saw this book and deck set, and looked at the few images the deck showed, and the really cheap price, I was sold.   Now to be quite honest with you, being Latino the only experience I have with Astrology is Walter Mercado, and the rest, well I can say I am astrologically illiterate.  So of course I had my doughts on purchasing this deck.  But the cheap price and the beautiful images shown in the back won me over.    This oracle deck is as it proclaims, Radiant, but more than that it is truly breathtaking.  And you do not have to even know astrology to start reading because each of the 84 cards has a key word that can get you to start reading right away.  So if you are a seasoned Tarot reader, or a newbie, these are truly perfect.<br />I had seen Caroline Smith's previous works with the Elemental Tarot, and I thought they were okay, was not really impressed.  But these are just beautiful.  .   One of the things that really first attracted me to these cards is the art work.  Each image conjures and inspires the psyche within in ways that I never thought possible.  The art used is a collage of Medieval, and renaissance images, that reminds me of art work used in ancient grimoires, occult books, and ancient maps  The other thing I loved about this deck is that the cards are really eclectic, and one does not have to be a student of Astrology to use them..   Occult and religious Images grace each card, images such as Voodoo Veves and other occult sigils, Buddha,  Hindu Gods, Biblical characters such as Solomon and Moses, dragons, demons, Greek gods, Egyptian images, Angels, fairies, and so on and so on.  Each card is breathtaking, and beautiful.  <br />Unlike traditional tarot, this does not have the Major or Minor arcana.  Instead it is broken into 7 suites.  They are the Sun, Moon, Mercury, Venus, Mars, Jupiter, and Saturn.  Each suite has 12 cards each using the 12 zodiac signs, Leo, Scorpio and so on.   The cards are the size of playing cards, and shuffle with ease for small hands.  The cards are of a medium thick stock with a nice coating for durability.  The thing I love the most about this deck is that one does not have to be fluent in Astrology, and it is a good tool for those who want to begin to learn about Astrology.  But not just that the images really wakes the curiosity, and at least for me, made me want to search the meaning behind the pictures.  <br />There where only two problems that I found with this kit.  One although I love the book that it comes with, it is made in a way that the back flap is also the base where the cards are held.  So when you are reading the book, there is this big flap that is anointing, until of course you use scissors and carefully cut along the crease to get rid of this really annoying flap.    If you are a seasoned card reader, you will have a bag or box to place the cards, and that is that.  The other problem i had was the really bad typo in the beginning of the book.  It begins with a Short introduction, that would have been beautiful, but the typo made you feel like you where Elmer Fudd.  All the s where replaced by f, and it makes it confusing to read.  But beside these two minor little problems, that can really be fixed or overlooked.  This is one of the most beautiful oracle decks, I have seen.    I am still studying them, but because there is a key word printed on each card.  I have done minor test readings for myself that have come out really accurate.  This deck has a romantic renaissance; Medieval and Victorian feel to them, that conjurors the memory and feel of Spiritists, Mediums, Gypsi Witches, and Psychics of old, Its in the cards this will defiantly be a classic.
I can not really recommend this book.  It is not a bad book, a bit thin, and a bit pricy.   It has a few small highlights,  But most of the time I found myself flipping through the pages.  And in a book with such little pages, it stinks to have to flip. <br />Section 1 is about an individual named Maria going through divination.  I just could not get into it, and I skipped paragraph after paragraph trying to get the gist of it, and just could not.  <br />Most of what Mr. Mason has written about has been written better elsewhere.  For example The Altar of my Soul by Marta Moreno Vega, and Cuban Santeria by Baba Raul Canizares.  &lt;-- Ibae!!  I found the book to be a bit tedious, in the writing style. There was a story where an Elder Priestess is having an argument with an Italero over a derecho owed to her.   You read how this individual uses the religion only as a way of financial growth, and to boost her Ego, instead of her true love and respect for the religion.   Although this is true in many instances, I can not find the reason that led the author to write about it.<br />To be honest half the book is Glossary, and Notes.  This is good for the people who have little knowledge of Orishas worship, but a bit of a waist of space and money for the Orisha community who has all this information imbedded into their being.  <br />If you are beginning in Lukumi, or looking for research into the religion then you might like this book.   If you are already established into the religion, skip this book you will not be missing much.
Este es unos de los primeros libros de la religion de los Brujos llamado Wicca en espaniol.  The book of Shadows en Espaniol o El Libro De Sombras. Y anque yo no soy Wicca, quisas brujo o hechisero, perro Wiccan no.  Pero como quiera este libro es interesante.  Y se lo recomiendo a el que tenga curiosidad.   <br />This is one of the first complete Spanish books on the Witches religion known as Wicca.  El Libro De Sombras, or The Book of Shadows, is an excellent guide for the practicing Brujo, who has an intrest in learning a thing or two on Wicca.  Although I am not Wiccan, I find \\"some\\" concepts  interesting.
Draja  Mickaharic's books A Century of Spells, and Spiritual Cleansings have been in my library since the 80's, and although many magical books, and spell books have been bought afterwards, I always seam to go back to Draja.  A Century of Spells dabbles and mixes well Southern Hoodoo, Santeria, Christian Magic, and Caribbean Magic.    This book is filled with wise wisdom on how to create excellent and powerful ritual incense such as High Spirit Incense, Meditation Incense, and House blessing Incense, it also gives you good instructions on how to fumigate, \\"smudge\\" with incense.  The Herb section is just a quick basic intro to herbalism, and some of the herbs used in Hoodoo Magic such as Solomon's Seal, Snakeroot, and Poke root to name a few.  <br />There are spells using loadstones, how to create Four Thieves Vinegar.  Methods for Spiritual Bath., oils, water sprinkles, spoken spells, and written spells are also discussed.  If you are an opened minded person, because the book has spells using Jesus Christ, the Archangels, The Seven African Powers \\"Orishas\\", and Allah, then this little handy book belongs in your library.
The Quest Tarot has to be one of the most stunning tarot decks I have had the pleasure of setting my eyes on.  I have so many Tarot Decks, and this new deck has to be one of my favorites of the Modern Deck.   The Art Work has a beautiful fantasy feel to them, and the colors are bright and envelop the interpreter as well as inspire the intuition.  <br />The Major Arcana are the typical but instead of 22 cards there is an extra card,  Zero titled the Multiuniverse, actually there are two Zero cards, the Fool, which happens to be my most favorite fool in any Tarot Deck.   Each of the cards has a Zodiac Symbol on the top left corner, and an Ancient Rune on the Right Corner.   On the bottom center of each card is the title of the Card, with an inspirational key word that would be helpful for the beginner as well as the advanced Tarot Reader.   The Fool is \\"beginnings\\" The Magician is \\"transmutation\\" The High Priestess, \\"Meditation\\" and on an on.  The Pip or the Minor Arcana are the traditional Wands, Cups, and Swords with the exception of the Coins which become the Stones.  Again the Minor Arcana follow the style of the Major Arcana, with a Zodiac Symbol on the top left corner, but this time a I Ching sign is on the Right Corner.    Again in the center bottom is a key word to help you along the way.    The images of the Minor Arcana is that of the Cups, ects ect.  But very beautifully done.  <br />In stead of the typical King, Queen, Knight and Page, this deck uses the Father, Mother, Son and Daughter.  In this there was one small problem.  If you ever read comic books, every one will remind you of the Silver Surfer Superhero, who flies around in the cosmos in a Surfing Board.  They really reminded me of that.  But still they are just as beautiful as the rest of the deck.  <br />There is one more thing I like about this deck, the blank Significator Card,  you can use it as the siginificator or create your own card.  <br />As a New Age type deck, I really have to recommend it, if you like psy-fi, with a comic book feel to it, then this deck will be fun to use.  They really are eye candy, but I am a Traditional  pre-Rider-Waite Tarot reading kinda guy, I do not know if I would use them.  But I enjoy having them in my collection they are beautiful.
I really love this book, and found it so helpful, it is rare that you will find a book with so much information on the usage of herbs as done in the Hoodoo Magical system.    This is the first book of its kind, dealing directly with the botanical usage within African-American Folk Magic.  This book is packed with about 750 useful potions, spells, baths, and powders that the reader can start to learn Wright away.   The 500 herbs, roots and minerals used in this book are so helpful, even for those who practice Santeria, and Voodoo, and even the Witch or Herbalist with European background will find this very useful.  No where will you find a collection of magical herbs such as this.  Herbs mentioned are, Adam and Eves roots, Devil's Shoestring, Bloodroot, Devil Pod, and this book goes on and on.  I was really excited about this book, and it has not let me down.   My favorite sections and what really caught my eye on these books are the 6 very helpful charts that cover everything from love drawing, to protection, and conjurations.  Also the 50 black and white illustrations are also really good.<br />This book also covers the preparation of famous Voodoo and Santeria oil dressings, bath crystals, incenses, floor washes, cleansing and spiritual baths and the preparation of mojo bags.  <br />I have to highly commend Catherine Yronwode, for such an important book, which in my opinion is a modern classic in the usage of herbal magic.   This book belongs in every rootworker, witch, santero, and shamans private collection.  I highly recommend this book, and wish I could give it more stars.

I purchased this book through the Internet, and when it arrived it was not exactly what I thought.  It was somewhat of a simple guide, really for the beginners, and it read, really simple.  My 10 year old daughter enjoyed it.  I was expecting a serious book, with excellent references on Demons, but what I got was a \\"basics Demons 101\\" type book.   I got this book for the section on the 7 Deadly Sins; hoping to get a thorough explanation on each, but each demo was rushed through, with not enough info, on each particular demon.   <br />The Lore section on each Demon was interesting, and my kids enjoyed that as much as I did, but the section on Disarming and Dispelling Demons, was honestly not what I had expected.   \\"Placing barrels on the side of a boats to discourage Water Spirits or Mermaids from bothering a boat.\\"  ???  Ooo-kay then, or Shutting Doors on Shaitan Demons, disarms them..  This section on dispelling was based more on Folklore.   People must understand that Demons, and Spirits, are not bothered by barrels or closed doors, and that was simply just to funny, and info like that would put Buffy and the Charmed Ones out of business.  Lol.   This is an okay book, I honestly can not recommend it, as each entry leaves you wanting to know more information.  And the Dispelling Section was also very disappointing.  But my kids liked it, so I have to give it that extra star, because it kept them quiet for awhile.
I have mix feelings over this book, so I can not give it any more then 3 stars.  It is a good basic intro for those who are curious in the Brazilian Orisha \\"Orixa\\" sects of Umbanda, Candomble, Macumba, and Quimbanda.  But it defiantly is not the best.  Well only a quick rush through of each sect is explained.  So reading it felt a bit rushed through.  <br />There are sections on the Orixas, and the Orixas discussed are Iansa \\"Oya\\", The Ibeji \\"the Divine Twins\\", Iemanja \\"Yemaya\\", Nana, Ogum, Omolu, Olorun, Oxala, Oxossi, Ossae, Oxum, Oxumare, Xango,  Exu, Pomba Gira, and other inor Orixas,  Each section gives you a an explanation of the Orixa as well as a Legend that goes behind the Orixa.  <br />There is also a section on Spirit Guides such as the Pretos Veljos, \\"The Ancient Black Ones\\", and the Caboclas, which is a bit interesting.   The section of Botanicals is okay, but honestly one can get a better selection in the book \\"Sacred Leaves of Candomble\\".    There is a small section of Sigils I like, I have to admit.<br />Know why can I not give this book 5 stars, well it is the section on \\"Spellwork\\"  It starts of with a picture of Carol L Dow, on a street  corner making a sacrifice to the Orixa Pomba Gira.   She does not look like a traditional Umbanda or Candomle priestess, she looks like a Wiccan Witch.   Then the spells again read like one that one finds in the Wiccan Books of Shadows that are sold for a dime a dozen.  \\"How to Enlarge your Breasts!\\" \\" How to Find a lover!\\"  That really made the book cheasy, and really disrespects these ancient religions.  If it was not for that section alone.  The book would be an okay intro to Umbanda, and Candomble.   But honestly these religions have been written better else where.
This is an excellet book on Palo.  With new Firmas ( Sigils )never before seen on print in the english market, the translated names of Palos and Herbs as used in the Cuban Palo Religion.  This is an excellent introduction to the Palo Mayombe and Palo Monte Traditions.   I loved it, if you read Baba Raul's other books, this is similar to Cuban Santeria in it's format and the way it was written, so if you enjoyed that boo, you will like this one even more.
This is one of those books that is actually as much fun to read as it is informative.  I intentionally keep this book on my coffee table, for when friends or guests comes over, because they always get a kick at answering some of the questions and seeing how psychic they are.   There are a few, \\"Check the Box\\" and see your answer, which are really interesting and everyone from my mom to my daughters enjoyed seeing how psychic they are.<br />The book also has beautiful bright pictures that impressive the eyes,  and sections on Palmistry, Tea Leaf Reading, the Aura, Mind Over Matter, Mind Reading, The Chakras, Dreams, Tarot, Crystal Balls, Pendulums, Healing with the Hands, and the list goes on. <br />This book is on of my favorites, because it really sets the mood for a good time when friends or family come over.  The Tests really are impressive, and fun, and every one who has been to my home, has fiddled through the book and taken the tests, even my skeptic brother answered the questions, and found out he was a &quot;Closet&quot; Shaman.  Which of course awakened his curiosity.  This really is a fun book, and a good intro to many Psychic and Occult mediums.
This has to be one of the most impressive books on Witches and Witchcraft I have ever Purchased.   One because it is not exclusively about Wicca, but of Witchcraft.  ( Let the world understand that not all Witches, are Wiccans.  First of all the book is huge, and has entries on Demons, the Devil, \\"Which really did have a big part in the history of Witchcraft.\\"  What impressed me the most of this Huge Book was that it was not just only about European Witchcraft, but also has entries on Witchcraft from around the world.<br />The Book is one of those books that if you have a question on Witchcraft, just alphabetically look it up and it will be there, both the black and white aspects of witchcraft are included.   There are entries on  Grimoires, Black Magic, Voodoo, Santeria, Quimbanda, Stregarism, A few entries on popular Wiccan Authors, Curses, Spells, Brujeria, Curanderismo, Salem Witch trials, Sorcery, Evil Spirits, Shamanism,The Orishas, the Loa, Morgan La Fey, Merlin, Voodoo Queens, and the list goes on and on.  Yep and it is al in one impresive volume, that should be in every Witches, or Brujos Library. This is a good book to have, but not really meant for the Wiccan Faint of Heart.
The Ancient Italian Tarots has to be one of my most favorite decks.  Reason being, they have an Old World charm, that when used for giving readings, they take you back in time.  They really have this Fortune Telling Feel to them, that I am crazy about.    This deck is in the tradition of the various Marseilles decks, but instead of hard looking wood blocked images, these are drawn.  The style is that expected from the Renaissance era.    Of all the classic tarot decks that are in the market today, these are my most favorite.  They are beautiful, and really do inspire the intuition.
One of the Most Brilliant Writers of the Orisha of modern day, Awo William Bascom has written some of the greatest books of Orisha and Yoruba Religion and Spirituality of our times.  All of his books are destined to be classic in Orisha Literature.  <br />16 Cowries as all his books are a must have for all young babalorishas and iyalorishas, and for the young Iyawo ask your godparents what there opinion is on this book, and I am sure you will get a good response.   Of the few books of Merinndilloggun this has to be the best, in fact all of Awo Bascoms books blow away all the other books on the same subject.  I highly recommend all the young Aborishas, and Iyawo, to check out his works.  They are all a wealth of information and should be in every ones Library.   Awo William Bascom has written some of the best books of Orisha Spirituality.
First of all I really do like both of Joseph Murphy's books.  This one and Santeria African Spirits in America.  They speak truthfully, and are an excellent recourse of information for those who are curious in understanding the Lucumi Santeria Religion.  Working the Spirits is a remarkable read, full of wisdom, and respect.  `No he is not an Initiated priest of the Religion!\\"  But Mr. Murphy writes with such respect, and one can tell he really researched the various Orisha religions, and grew to have a great respect and love for them.  While I highly recommend Santeria African Spirits in America for those who want to have some knowledge of the Lucumi Religion, I also have to recommend Working the Spirits, as it goes into the Orisha sects of Candomble, Umbanda, Voodoo, Brujeria, and Espiritismo.
Okay I have to give my props to Ocha'ni Lele, he has written an excellent book, and all though not as good as Awo William Bascom's masterpiece \\"16 Cowries\\", it still is a good read.  But it is very Good Book, but a bit misleading to all those who think that just buy reading this book, and playing with cowrie shells that they will instantly become an Italero or an Oriate.    To fully write a book on the mysteries of reading los caracoles, volumes upon volumes would be required.    And trust me, all that is reading the Dilloggun has not been written in this book, or any book for that matter.    Dilloggun is not the tarot, we do not have the \\"Lets learn The Dilloggun for Begginners\\"  As due all these dime a dozen Wiccan books, that make it look cheesy and cheap.  In order to learn these ancient mysteries one must dedicate their life to the Orishas, ones godparents and ones Ile. Our Knowledge comes passed down as a parent passes down moral lessons to ones children.  <br />So although this is a neat little into book to understanding the Basic Concepts of interpreting the Dilloggun, understand that there is so much information that can not be learned  buy just reading, every good book needs a good professor behind it.   Although I give my respects for Ocha'ni Lele's efforts, he is a good writer.  Understand that these books can only give you limited information.  It is books like these that can be dangerous to an ancient beautiful Spirituality. soon we will have the uniitiated Santero, or the solitary Wiccan initiated Santero running a 1-900 dilloggun Psychic Hotline.
It is really to bad that most of Awo Fa'lokun Fatunmbi's books are out of print, or hard to find.  His books are truly a great wealth of resource and information, useful both to the Ifa and Orisha Community.   His works are written in an intelligent manner that is very expressive and literate, so it will take an average person, \\"such as myself\\" a few reads to grasp the wealth of wisdom.  But it is well worth the read.  He has written some of my favorite books on the various orisha Religions.  Other books to look for if you can are.  \\"Iba'se Orisa, Ifa proverbs, Folktales, Sacred History, and Prayers.\\" <BR>Also \\"Iwa-Pele: Ifa Quest the Search for the Source of Santeria and Lucumi\\"  He also has a very hard to find booklet collection and some are found in Amazon.com, on various Orisa energies that are well worth the read.    Highly Recommended, check out \\"Awo Study Center\\" Where you will find a wealth of his works.
I am not one of Carlos Montenegro, and as we say in Spanish.  \\"He is not a Saint of my Devotion.\\"  But I have to say that this little booklet impressed me.  Okay the baths are a bit elaborate; the book has a cookbook feel to it.  But the herbs where accurate, and to what Orisha ruled them as well.  The only problem is that, if you do not know what these herbs are, you are going to be lost.  As only the Spanish name is given, there is no English or Latin translation.<br />To make this a really complete Herbal Bath of Santeria, there should have been a section on how to properly prepare the baths, these are not proper.  In dealing with herbs, Orisha practitioners know that praise and songs are given to Osain for hemust be always be petitioned, and this is a ritual in itself.  Also there are certain ways in handling the herbs to get the proper Ashe' out of them, this is not discussed.<br />If you want to learn how to prepare herbal baths in the Santeria tradition, I would recommend you just watch your godparents.  If you do not have godparents and fear the over charge in prices that most \\"Botanica owner charge, who are not really initiated into Santeria\\" charge.  Trust me there are allot of charlatans, and I agree with the previous review.  I would rather recommend the books Spiritual Cleansing: Handbook of Psychic Protection and Original Publication's Complete Book of Baths, by Robert Laremy.  These books are not Orisha or Santeria, per say they are more Brujeria, but well worth the read.  But these books can never make you an expert in Spiritual Healing, as these lessons are best learned with first hand experience.  A book can never replace a well knowledge teacher.<br />Know I said this book impressed me, well with all due respects to Carlos Montenegro.  If you have read any of the other Hog Wash he has written, this one would impress you too.
I think this is the only book dedicated to the materials used in the Thrones of the Orishas as well as the Traje De Galas,  Beautiful pictures of panios, coronas, ceremonial vestments.  Informative.  This is a good book for the curious who would like to see what our sacred initiation garments, Shrines, and altar items look like.  Smnall into to some of the Orisha as venerated in Santeria.  <br />This is not traditional ceremonial clothing as used in Yorualand, but that of the Lucumi Ocha followers of the New World.  And let me stress, that the garments and thrones, are an Art Form in themselves.  Beautiful Pictures.
Finally a book, that truly has been needed for the Orisha community in a long time.    A book that discusses the very controversial subject of Women's role in the priestly order of the Orishas.  Also it discusses how to detect the very true subject of the charlatan Priests who use there titles for manipulation and power.   It also explores the subject of ethical and moral conflicts within the various Orisha traditions.  This book is for all the Orisha devotees who are searching to find Spiritual fulfillment and development within the Orisha community.  <br />I applaud Iyanifa Ileana, for this beautiful book depths and character, this book is one that is much needed in the community, as it will open the eyes of many who are blinded by this New Age of Charlatan Priests who care more for there wallet, ego and power then the spiritual development of those who search for the.  Thank you Iyanifa Ileana, from a male Lucumi Omo Ochun who agrees with you 100%. A+++
This  has to be one of the most important books in Newyorican literature.  Equally as beautifully written as, Esmeralda Santiago's \\"When I Was Puerto Rican\\".  And Like Santiago's book, this one belongs in every Puerto Rican home.  The book is powerful, raw, and holds nothing back.  This is the autobiography of Piri Thomas, a Puerto Rican growing up in the harsh streets of Spanish Harlem.   His harsh and troublesome relationship with his father.  His early loss of his mother.  Growing up with his friends in a gang, drugs, facing racism,  incarceration, and at the end.  Healing and growing.  <br />This book was given to me by a School Counselor in High School, and it has been with me ever since.   Working with Street teenagers, I have also followed the tradition of my school councilor, and have given it to a few kids from the neighborhood who have never read an entire book in their whole lives.  Afterwards, they have come back and thanked me.  This is one of those books that hits the mark.  <br />Piri Thomas's  \\"Down These mean Streets\\"  holds an important spot in my library, it is a book that should be read, by all young men, no matter your backgrounds.  It shows that no matter how harsh life may be, no matter how many bad cards life deals you, or how many harsh blows it throws at you, there is always hope.  If Piri Thoma, as well as my self made it out of the streets alive, and live today in Peace, anyone can.  Highly Recomended.
Art, Poetry, Short Stories, Drawings.  Stories of Religion, from Catholic, to Santeria.  From growing up in hungry in the streets of Spanish Harlem, to growing up in the rural areas of La Isla.  From being a street hood, to being a Chico and The Man Tv Star.  Boricuas, is destined to be a classic.  In this collection you get only the best, from the best Puerto Rican writers and poets.  Piri Thomas, Esmeralda Santiago,  Judith Cofer, Nicholasa Mohr, just to name a few of these talented writters.  What I love the most about this book is that it will introduce many Puerto Ricans as well as the rest of the world to the many talented  Boricua authors there are.    This book will fill you with pride and joy, if you are ever thinking of that perfect gift for that young adult Boricua in your life, this is it.
Although as an Omo Ochun, I embrace the Future of my Orisha, but I can not let go of the past of my Santos.  In my home both the Orisha / Supreme Guardian Angels as well as the Santos are well respected.  This book is good, but to be honest with you, most of the information in this book has been passed down to me, by my mother and grandparent.  None of the information was new to me.  I read the book in less than a few hours, as it was just a brush down of everything passed down to me.<br />But to those who's parents are not Curanderas, or Santeras, this will be a neat book.  You will finally get an understanding of what those fancy candles sold in Botanicas and what they are used for.  The Section of the Saints is nice, but you can find better info in one of those Catholic Saints Dictionaries.  <br />The Psalms of the Bibles, section is okay.  The Psalms are very powerful prayers and invocation.  This is just a quick reference; there are better books out there on the subject.  <br />This book is okay, if you do not know the information, I guess this book would be helpful, if not, save your [money]
With all due respects to my elder Babalawo, but I believe that we all as human beings and followers of the Orisha, need sacred texts as all major religions do.  The Christians have the Bible, the Muslims the Quran, and the Hindu's the Bhagavad Gita. This book may not be the answer to any of those sacred texts I have mentioned, but it is quite certainly a good start.  Not only for divination, but also for spiritual inspiration as well as daily affirmations.<br />My highest respects to Afolabi Epega, for translating these ancient texts known as the Sacred Living 256 Odus<br />of our Lord the great prophet / Irunmole / Orisha, Orunmila.  This book belongs in the shelf of every Orisha worshipper.  This book is great only because of Afolabi Epega, the rest of the introduction should have been left out, and is not needed.<br />One who reads this book must understand that the whole view and teachings of each Odu would fill many, many volumes of books, this is just but a great start.
I bought this book for my daughter this Christmas, because she is starting to have an interest in Tarots.  So before I wrapped it up, I flipped through the pages, and found my self, not being able to put the book down.  Know, yes I know this book is intended for the younger generation, as it tackles issues teenagers would face, and how each certain Tarot card, would fall in that category, blah blah blah.  But I found information in this book that you will not find anywhere else.   Although this book gives the traditional interpretations for many of the cards, it also gives fresh and new ideas, new insights that really do make since and goes with the changing times.  <br />This has to be \\"one\\" of my favorite books on the Tarot subject.  Needless to say my daughter caught me reading the book, so that spoiled that, but it is a book that has brought us both together, in a subject that we both love. <br />I highly recommend this book for all those starting to learn the divination art form of the Tarot, as well as those advanced, trust me, there are may good surprises in this book.  A+++++ * * * * * 5 Stars, good book, and very easy to learn and enjoy.  This book is destined to be a classic amongst the young, as well as the young at heart.
The Works of Migene Gonzalez Wippler are the most widely distributed and best selling books on the Subject of Santeria, and Cuban Lucumi. Her works are both liked and disliked, liked buy the community who are new to Santeria, and very much disliked buy Elders and initiates in the religion.<br />It is not that Wippler's books are not accurate, they are. It is just that they seam to closely resemble other published books on Lucumi and Santeria that have been written in Spanish and have no copyrights. But aside from this, &quot;if you can put this aside, many of the Elders in the religion, will not.&quot; (That is steeling) Then you have a pretty interesting book, full of basic wisdom and knowledge that really opens the doors for new comers into the religion, or for those who have a basic curiosity. &quot;I guess those who do not know gotta start somewhere.&quot; I recommend it to those who have no knowledge of the religion, it breaks that Voodoo stereo type, but this book is pretty much a stepping stone for other bigger and greater things. But I do not completely dislike her books, in fact I recommend this book, and Powers of the Orishas, to all Aleyos out there.
There are mix reviews of this book, some like it; some do not, as everything in life.  But if you want to learn this \\"History\\" of the Lucumi religion known as Santeria as practiced in Cuba, then this is really not that bad of a book.   This is not one of those, \\"How to Books\\", it is as I have said, more of a historical prospective.  Good for those who just want a basic understanding of the Santeria.   It also touches on the Palo Mayombe, and Monte, and gives a bit of the differences between the different people of Africa and their Spiritual backgrounds.   <br />A lot of people do not like it, or like to discredit it,  but honestly the information is well researched, and aquarate.  All done in the most High Respects and in good taste to the Santeria Lucumi Religion.
From a Puerto Rican father of three daughters, and as many Puerto Rican families, my children come in various tones of color.  My eldest is Castillian White with Hazel eyes, and my twins one is dark with beautiful curly hair, she took the side of my Mother's African Yoruba background, the other, straight dark hair, with  her beautiful Taino colored skin that comes from my fathers side.   I bought this book way back in August 1996.  ( I date all my children's books) and it has held a very important spot in our personal library.  I can not agree withy the other review on this book.    It has nothing to do with racial.   Take it from me, a Puerto Rican male of mixed backgrounds who follows an African Spiritual tradition.  This book is Innocently Beautiful, Reminiscent of our Boriquen Mulatto Heritage.  Africano + Taino + Castillano = Puerto Rican.<br />It is 4 classic tales of Puerto Rican folklore, from the legendary Juan Bobo.  The Stories are told buy mulatto author and writer, Carmen Bernier, and Ernesto Ramos Nieves.  The illustration are beautiful in a childish way, bright colors that are so remanisant of the Puerto Rican rural countryside.       If you look at the characters closely, no one is truly white, as was stated in a review prior to mine.  In fact if you look at the \\"White\\" neighbor, she has the appearance of a mulatto, as does every one in the book.   Also she lives in a wooden casita, as does Juan Bobo and his Mother.   <br />This book is very much true to our Boriquen People on the island, it is not uncommon to see in one family, different tones and different colors.  All the tales in this book are classics in Puerto Rican literature and folktale.   The stories are as follows.<br />There are many books out there about Juan Bobo, and each one is a gem, and the stories presented here can be read in other books.  But this is \\"An I Can Read Book\\" Aimed for younger children.  Infect it was this book that one of my daughters read buy herself from front to back.   I love this book and highly recommended.   The stories are as follows.<br />The Best Way to Carry Water, <BR>A Pig in Sundays Clothes.<BR>Do Not Sneeze, Do Not Scratch.....  Do Not Eat.<BR>and  A Dime A Jug..   Each one is a classic as verbally passed down  to our parents from our Abuelos, and their Abuelos.
I thumbed through this booklet, and to be honest was not impressed.  This book was to much like one of those Wiccan Book of Shadows that are sold in book stores for a dime a dozen.  And like those books, you pay for a bunch of nothing.    Creative Ritual, shows how to cast a circle.  \\"????????\\"  How to build a Spirit Altar, which was seamed like a First grade project, and dabbles a bit on Obi divination, but instead of using the Coconut, he advices cowrie shells or coins.<br />One review wrote how this is a good introduction to Espiritismo.  This is far from el Espiritismo as practiced by my grandparents.  I am sorry this book would have been good, if it taught something or had something to say.  Which quite honestly it does not.  But what can you expect for 4 bucks..  If you are looking for a good book on this sort of subject, check out the Voodoo Grimoire, by El Negro Jose
If you are looking for an excellent book on the Candomble Orixa Worship of Brazil, then this is the classic.  The book as the title states is of the power of the Brazilian Priestesses of the orixas, also known as orisha.  Mai De Santos, or Priestesses of Orixas are as powerful, and as highly respected as the Babalawos of the Ifa and Babalorichas of Lucumi.  I highly recomend this to all Voodoo Mambos, Santeria Santeras, and all Woman of the world, who believe in the power of Woman.<br />From a man's point of view this is a brilliant and inspiring work, and should be read buy all who honor the Ancient African Gods.
Sadly to say, I know a few people, who have little knowedge of Orisha, or Orisha worship that have come to me with this book.  I always respond, that the book is misleading and disrespectful.  The title alone, 10 Minutes, goes against everything believed in Orisha divination and religious structure.  &quot;Bit by Bit, we eat the........&quot;  for those who know of this ancient  Yoruba Proverb.  Everything takes time, respect and dedication.  This book flushes that theory down the drain.  But falsely as the information is not correct and inacurate.
This book is good, especially for those who have little knowledge of those mysterious bottled powders sold in Botanicas and voodoo Supply shops.  This is not a \\"How To\\" Guide on making the Powders or Incenses but rather an explanation of the bottled incenses and powders sold in the Shops.  These are the famous Powders used in Mojo Bags, gris gris, and prendas.  You will learn what those famous Powders such as Seven African Powers, Fast Luck, Graveyard Dust, High John the Conqueror, and Jinx Removing are used for.  The section I liked the most where the scattered prayers and invocations thought the book.  Anna Riva's collection of books are easy enough for the novice...
This is an okay book, I guess a good introduction of oils as sold in Botanicas and new Age Shops thought the country.    The book is not a \\"How to Make Oils\\" but a guide to all those really good smelling oils used in Santeria and Voodoo.   What I liked most about this book where the Invocations and Prayers thought the book, it is very universal, as you will find Christian, Voodoo, Santeria and even Asian prayers.   I like the section of Anointing Oils over the body, seals, amulets and candles.  Although it was briefly discussed, it gives you the basics of \\"How to\\".
There are no secrets revealed here, so please do not let the title get you.  Simply it is a very thin booklet of translations of words used in Voodoo, as well as the names of the Lwas, the Might Spirits of Voodoo.  If you want to learn some definitions then this is some what worth the $4.95, but if you want a book on Voodoo Secrets, Religion and Magic, check out The Voodoo Grimoire, by El Negro Jose and Secrets Of Voodoo by Milo Rigaud.  Both currently in stock at Amazon.com
All of Anna Rivas books are fun, and pretty much simple enough that every one can understand them.  Secrets of Magical Seals, does not really reveal any secrets.  It is an illustrated guide of magical seals.  60+ page booklet is packed jammed with Seals used in many Magical and Occult Philosophies.  The booklet has Seals of the Days and Seasons.  Magic Tables, Seals and Symbols of the Planets, magic Squares of Abra Melin, Seals of Solomon, Astrological Symbols, and Signs, Seals of the Spirits.  ( <--- I found this Section very Useful)  Egyptian Symbols, Seals of the Sage of the Pyramids, Seals from the 6th and 7th books of Moses, Islamic Talismans, Gnostic Seals, Shields of the Saints, Power Squares, Chinese Seals, Voodoo Veves.  \\"I have seen many Voodoo Veves, but I have never seen these.  Voodoo Veves are more complex and ritualistic, these presented here seamed childlike and simple.\\"  And lastly Japanese Talismans.   <br />My favorite part of all of Anna Rivas books are the prayers and invocations, which are usually scattered through out the books.  At seeing this book I thought there where none, but was happy to find a collection of Protection and other prayers in the last two pages of the book.

This is not a book on the Voudun Religion, but is what the title suggests a Grimoire of Voodoo as practiced in the southern stats of America.  And as most Grimoires it is intended for the Sorcerer as a guide for invoking and conjuring Spiritual Beings, as well as casting hexes.   This is a book of Folk Magic, brought to the Americas by African Congo Slaves.   The book is a bit expensive, but the wealth of information is priceless.  The only thing is that allot of people who really do not have the proper knowledge of working Voodoo or brujeria, can really harm themselves or others.   In the Voodoo Grimoire the reader learns how to work the candles.  Learns how to conjure the dead as done in Southern Voodoo.  Learns a form a bone casting Voodoo divination, call upon Papa Legba as well as other Lwas, and Spirit Families for aid.  Learn how to build an Ancestral Altar, and learn how to create a Hoodoo box.  All in all it is a Grimoire and can be dangerous for the person who uses it with no proper training, lack of respect, or ignorance.
I come across allot of people who ask me about those Spanish herb used in Santeria or Brujeria, or the herbs sold in the Botanica Shops, with the Spanish names like.  Rompe Zaraguey, Pica Pica, or Quita maldicion.  These are popular herbs used in the ancient rights of Santeria, Voodoo and Brujeria.  But for those who do not speak Spanish, these herbs are almost impossible to identify.  Finally a book that answers, not all but allot.  but a good amount.  <br />In this little book you will find a wealth of information, on the translation of those exotic herbs with Spanish names.  You will also get traditional spells as done in the Caribbean.   Finally a rode map book for the Herbal section of the Botanicas.   A useful little book that is highly recommended.
This was my first book on the Chakra system and to be quite frankly it has been one of those books I always go back to look for references.   My personal opinion is that Anodea Judith, PhD, has done an excellent book, both for the beginner in working and understanding the Chakras as well as the advanced.<BR>Each chapter is dedicated to a particular Chakra.   You will learn, the Sanskrit name to each Chakra, it's meaning, location, Element, Function, Inner State, Outer State, Body Parts, color, Mantra sound, Hindu Deity, as well as other deities from other pantheons.  Also each chapter has a meditation on that particular Chakra as well as Yoga exercises to harness that particular Chakra to your favor.    I have been directed to other books, because people say that there are better books out there.  But to be honest this book for beginners is simple and right to the point.  Anodea Judith, PhD writing is down to earth, and direct.  Think about it, how can 100,000 readers go wrong.  If you are looking for your first book on Chakras, you will not go wrong here.  This is a good book, full of a wealth of information.
Do you want to have your own personal Zen Master, Guru, or Old Wise Yogi to help you along your Spiritual Growth and in life in general?  Sure you do, but you ask yourself.   \\"Where am I going to find a Wise Master in the Heartlands of America, the Deep South, or in the Rural New England?\\"  You can find this Wise Guru deep within, as we all have Wise Spirit Guides, and with the use of these beautiful cards, you can finally harness their voice.  <br />The Osho Zen Tarot card, is not like your traditional Tarot, but something more.  Each card has a beautiful image with one single word, and when the cards are lade out in front of you, many of your questions can be answered.  These cards are beautiful and good to use during your personal meditation time.  I use the Osho Zen Tarot  as a great tool for meditation, you know sometimes the mind wonders when we meditate, and this is an excellent way to control the mind.  Ask a question as you begin to meditate and pull out one card and meditate on that certain card.  <br />The Osho Zen tarot is good for your own Spiritual Work, or for giving readings to those who are also on a Spiritual Road.  But do not confuse this deck with your average Fortune Telling Tool, or Tarot Deck, as this deck will confuse those who seek answers to love, money and material gain.   The Osho Zen Tarot is a tool for inner and Spiritual Growth.   The Osho Zen tarot is excellent when working with your Spirit Guides, Ancestors or Angel Guides.   Place these on your Ancestral Shrine, and when ever you want an answer from your Spirit Guides or Ancestors lay the cards out, and get ready for a bit of enlightment.
This is not a book on Haitian Voudun, far from it.  This is a book on New Orleans Voodoo, which lately has become like an African American form of Wicca.  \\"No Pon intended.\\"  But honestly this is a good book, fun to read and really entertaining.  When anyone who has little knowledge of Voodoo or Santeria, ask me for a good book, I always recommend this one.  The reader is taken on a wonderful journey through Luisah Telsh's life, who may I add is a fellow Priestess of our mother Ochun, as well as a Mambo priestess.  There are some good prayers, spells, poems; you will also learn how to construct an altar for your Ancestors.  Learn the similarities of the Orishas and the Voodoo Lwas.    Many will find the section on hexing a good read, as well as the Ritual at the end of each chapter.     There is one problem I found in this book.  When one gives to the Orisha an offering, one must first consult using the obi oracle, to see if that particular Orisha is pleased with the offering, and if anything else is required from the Orisha.  Sadly to say Luisah Telsh did not go into full detail about that.  Infact she does not even mention it.  Those who are in the Orisha communities know this as a fact, and a person who has no knowledge would not.  But with that aside, I must say the book is still a good read.  Especially for those who are interested in simple basic rituals of empowerment.  This book is a mix of Yoruba and Voodoo religions, and it is really not aimed any any particular path.   Good and fun, buts don't expect any big secrets to be revealed here.
I received this as a birthday gift this year, and let e say it was a great gift indeed.  Within this excellent package you will receive an excellent Step Buy Step 124 page Guide, that has to be one of the best-published books on Meditation.  The book is excellent for both beginners and advanced.  Also in this package one gets two spoken Meditation and breathing exercises cds, as well as a pack of 12 cards, which I laminated and placed them on my refrigerator.   <br />Just to get a quick pick at how excellent this package is, the cards are.  The Four Noble Truths.  The Six Wholesome and Unwholesome Roots of the Mind.  The Noble Eightfold Path.  The Five Handrances.  The Three Kinds of Sufferings.  The Four Brahma Viharas.  The Eight Vicissitudes.  The Six Sense Doors and Three Feeling Tones.  The Four Metta Phrases.  The Six Stages of Metta.  The Seven Points of Posture, and The Five Precepts.    The Set could have done well without the cards, but they are excellent to keep in handy, in a place where you can read them frequently.<br />The two cds are spoken and very relaxing.   You here Sharon Salzburg's calming voice as she guides you through breathing exercises, and meditations. <br />I have a few books on Meditation, and to be honest, The book in this package, Insight Meditation, has to be my utmost favorite.   I love this set, and I recommend it to all that want to relieve stress from their lives, or want to connect with the divine within.  Highly Recommended.
Inspirational book especially for the newly initiated young Santo Iyawos as well as the Santero/as menores.  This is the personal story of Baba Ifa Karade.  The book is also good for those interested in a personal account of a priest's first step in an Ancient religion, as well it is interesting for African Americans who are searching for a spiritual belief system from the African continent.   It is a thin book that will take a day or two to read, but informative, truthful, soulful and entertaining.
Baba Canizares is a well known and highly respect Babalorisha of New York.  He has written about a dozen books, each aimed for the beginner in Santeria, Orisha and Voodoo religion.  Cuban Santeria is another of his good books; there are no secrets revealed here, or ceremonies or none of that.  What the book has is a mixture of autobiography, and tales as told to him buy his godparents.  The book is a good read, and lets those who are curious, come into a world of mystery, beauty and wisdom.   All of Baba Canizares books are entertaining, informative, and a pleasure to read.  Check out his other books or Orishas ISBN: 0942272692 as well as his respecteful selling book The Life and Works of Marie Laveau. Which Amazon.com should sell.  \\"Hint Hint\\"
This is a very beautiful deck, but I would recommend it more for the younger crowd, and maybe even for children. I bought this deck, and noticed how child like and the feel of the tarot had a Fairy Tale feel to it.   The deck was very beautiful, but for a 32-year-old father, it just did not feel write, so I let my pre-teen 11-year-old twin daughters look at them and see what they thought.  They absolutely loved them. If you are trying to teach your child how to read the tarot, then this surely is the deck.  There is no Nudity what so ever; every one is fully clothed.   The only disturbing cards are nine of swords and ten of swords, which are clones of the Rider Waite.  The Nine of Swords depicts a woman crying in bed, while the ten of swords shows the traditional man lying on the ground with the ten swords within his back.  Besides those two cards, the rest of the cards are easy enough for children to grasp.  Even the Major Arcana card number15 which is the Devil card, reminds me of one of those monsters fought on Children's cartoons like Dragon Ball Z, or Batman.<br />The Art is soft; the cards are small enough and comfortable for smaller hands, about the size of playing cards.  Everyone in the deck, with the exception of a selected few, is very young looking.  One of my 11-year-old daughters really loves this deck.<BR>I have read various reviews on this deck, mixture between positive and negative.  Though these cards are not meant for children, buy looking at its Fairy Tale feel of it, one could tell that children would be drawn to it, and it would be a good choice for parents looking for a starter deck for their children.
A Wise person once told me.  \\"Religion is another group of people's way to God; Spirituality is your way to God.\\"  Ever since then, though I respect many religious traditions, and being Initiated and Ordained as a Santeria Priest of Orisha Ochun.<br />This book is really beautiful, full of bright pictures, meditations and the belief systems from every corner of the globe.  This book has it all, Christianity, Hinduism, Paganism, African Spirituality, Zen and Shamanism.  Various forms of Spiritual beliefs which really enforce the ancient saying.  \\"All Roads lead to God.\\"  A beautiful book to be kept in your coffee table as it will defiantly spawn many interesting conversations with guests.  Also a good book for those who are just starting out on their road in Spirituality, this book has excellent Meditation exercises,  as well as so much  basic information, that it will open your yearning for wanting to learn more.  The book ends with an awesome \\"further reading section.\\" that has an excellent resource on other really good books.
This has Probably got to be the single most important Book on the Healing Hands.  Written in Textbook for, each chapter gives you a clear understanding of the energy of the Hands, how to heal with the hands, the aura and the chakras.  As Well each chapter gives you exercise as well as a mini test is also given at the end of each chapter. <br />There is a beautiful section with painted colored illustrations of the locations of the Chakras, the Human Energy Field, as well as penciled drawn sketches of exercises and of the laying of the hands.<br />Barbara Ann Brennan's book should be in the collection of all who are interested in this ancient form of healing.  Barbara has done a magnificent book, and after reading this book you will want to learn more, this is why I also highly recommend, Light Emerging: The Journey of Personal Healing, also written by Barbara Ann Brennan.   I cannot recommend this book enough, good for the beginners as well as the advanced.  Highly Recommended 5 * * * * *.
I can not give this book five stars or recommend it to all, because simply it is not meant for all.   What could have been a very beautiful introduction of African Egungun, Ancestor Veneration, took a few word twist that really feel heavy on my mind and I could not enjoy the book after this.   It is not that I am trying to discredit Ifagbemi Babalawo, buy no means.  I honestly give him my respects and reverences.   But let me explain what made this potentially good book turn a bit sower for me.<br />I was born Puerto Rican, and though my Father is of Taino bloodline, I took on my mothers Spanish Castilian completion.  This is also true to half of the Puerto Rican and Cuban population.  Either you are a mix of Castilian bloodline, with either African or Carib bloodline, or any mix of the three.   My Godparents in Ocha are both a married Cubans; my godfather like myself is of Castilian European background, and his wife my godmother is of predominantly African heritage.  So upon their Ancestral boveda lies pictures of their parents together, pictures of handsome and beautiful Cuban Men and Women, and yes you se the mix of black, white, and Indio Taino in the pictures.  These are the images of the Ancestors of my godparents.   This is the way you will see many Cuban and Puerto Rican Ancestral Shrines, with pictures of Ancestors that come from different groups, but they are all venerated as one.  <br />Know the book would have been a good read for many beginners, except for the Caucasian community who reads this book, and might find words of offense, as I did, and a few others of my White Latino brothers and Sisters, who have been worshipping the African Orisha ways since birth.  <br />Race should never be mentioned in Ancestor Veneration, thi makes people feel uncofrtable, and it s honestly not what respecting ones Ancestors is all about.   But if you can pass a few words that might sem bothersome to some, then this is a good book for those people who have no Common Knowledge of Ancestral Reverence.
I have a few books on Tarot, and to be honest with you, this has to be my most favorite book on the subject.   The meanings are easy enough for novice, and note worthy for the experienced Tarot reader.  You will get excellent descriptions of each card, both major and minor.  As well as excellent interpretations of the meanings for both upright and upside down cards.   I found this book to be excellent, and whenever I need references, I turn to it, as I am never disappointed.  I highly recommend this book.
I have a few books on Palmistry, including the classic Cheiro's The Language of the Hands, The Art of hand Reading, and so on and so on.  But to be frankly honest with you, none of those books compare to the excellent recourse of information given in this so called \\"Idiot's guide.\\"<br />There is an excellent section on interpreting the phalanges, which buy itself is an art all it's own.  Plus everything else is discussed in the book.  The mounts, the lines, skin texture, hand shape, and it goes on and on.   <br />This book was my first Idiot's Guide, that I have purchased, and the last book on Palmistry.   Being that it was such a well written and easy to understand book, I became obsessed with all things Idiot's Guides.  But trust me, an idiot's guide this is not.  A Wealth of information.  Excellent for the beginners as well as the advanced, there is something to learn for every one.
This was probably my first book on Voodoo that I purchased, and it still has to be one of my reference guides to the religious beliefs.  While other books dwell on magic, curses, and the curio folk magic of Hoodoo, this book gives you a collection of beautifully drawn Veves, excellent black and white photos, and a whole collection of traditional Voodoo prayers and chants.  Their is a section on classifying the various Lwas, or Loas, from the various Voodoo Mysteries, such as the Radas, Congos, Petros, Ibu, Nago, and the Dantor mysteries.  <br />This book is not for the beginners and it does not candy coat Voodoo, it gives you a ruff down of what Voodoo's practices, rites, passages, magic, and sacrifices are all about.  This book is an overview of the religion, as it is impossible for a Mystery of such vast Knowledge, beauty and Wisdom to be justly explained in 217 or so pages.  It is not meant for all, but for those who truly respects and want to honor the Lwas, this is a good start.  Although an ordained Houngan or Mambo would be your best bet.
I personally like all of Baba Raul Canizare's booklets on the Orishas, each booklet comes with various Patikis \\"Orisha Mythology and Legends\\" Songs, Chants, and Prayers.

They are just booklets, and are good for the novice in the religion, or those who are curious about a certain Orisha.   Worth the [money].  Check out the whole collection.

Iyawo or Yaguo depending on how you pronounce it, is the novice initiate of the Orisha Religion.  An Iyawo is an individual, both male, and female who has gone through the Kariocha Ceremonies and has had the Santo crowned upon the head.  During a year the Iyawo is to follow strict rules, wear white, and learn to respect and honor their ruling Orisha with pride and dignity.  <br />As a young initiate and a future Babalorisha or Iyalorisha (Priest / Priestess) I highly recommend this book to all Iyawo initiates.   The booklet is in Spanish, so it would help immensely if you knew the language.   This is the Manuel the How To for the newly crowned initiate, and a must have.

It wasn't a European Witch that started the Witch-hunts in Salem; in fact it was a young Barbados Voodoo Practitioner.  And although Tituba was no Voodoo Queen such as Marie Laveau, Tituba's life was just as interesting.  This is a good read.

This is the deck that I have used on forum groups, and in-groups settings.  I have used this deck for many years, and though my interests in various Tarot styles have grown in various years, this one still remians one of my personal favorites.  But honestly for those who have little knowledge of Afro-Caribbean earth religion and magic, this will be a very confusing deck.  First of all The New Orleans Voodoo Tarot, is not a real Tarot, in the sense of the word.  This alone will confuse the Waite followers.  Reason being the suits are not the typical coins, swords, cups, or clubs.  Instead they are based on earth Magico Religions and Spirituality from the Caribbean.  The Suits follow Rada, Congo and Petro, which are various Voodoo paths, and the fourth is Santeria, which has nothing to do with Voodoo, with the exception of some minor similarities.<br />The Major and Minor Arcana, one finds the ancient Lwa Gods of Voodoo, and the Orisha of Santeria.  The book gives a simple explanation of each Lwa and Orisha, enough that those who understand these powerful Spirits will get the jest of the meanings of the cards.  But for those who have no common knowledge of these Spirits, trust me you are going to get lost and frustrated.<br />The book does not give a good interpretation of the cards, and gives you only a few key words; this is done because most that follows the Orishas and the Lwas find the meanings of the cards from within.  The tarot is used as a vehicle from which the voice of the conscious mind and the Spirits of ones Ancestors can manifest and be heard.  So of course those who are used to buying a Deck of tarot that has a booklet with the meanings will be lost.<br />If you like this deck and the book is not that bad, as it gives basic rituals and sacrifices.  But I recommend you also study more on the Lwa and the Orishas, because without that basic knowledge you will never get the full force of this deck.  Also the Artist of this deck Sallie Ann Glassman has written a book that also goes with this deck Vodou Visions: An Encounter With Divine Mystery 0375753702, can also be purchased through Amazon.<br />The New Orleans Tarot is an excellent tool for divination, and would be good for the Voodooist \\"Hounfor / Mambo \\" As well as the Santero/as.  But also the tarot collector will truly appreciate the primitive and vivid art, and those who have some interest in Afro-Magic will find this a good starting point.  This deck is not really recommended to the fluff bunnies, and the faint of heart.as written a book that also goes with this deck Vodou Visions: An Encounter With Divine Mystery 0375753702, can also be purchased through Amazon. <br />The New Orleans Tarot is an excellent tool for divination, and would be good for the Voodooist \\"Hounfor / Mambo \\" As well as the Santero/as.

Harold Courlander, has written many books on African Legends and Folklore, but this one has to be one of his most important works, especially for the devotees of the Orishas, both here in the Americas as well as the world over.

This book gives you a good selection of the folklore as passed down from the Yoruba culture.  But not just the Yoruba orisa culture.  There is a section titled, The Yoruba Culture of Cuba.

When this deck and book set first came out, way back in the 90's, I was very happy and anxious to own the deck.  Finally a tarot deck in homage of the African Orishas.  Boy was I disappointed when I got this deck.  Let me begin with the book, which infect I enjoyed immensely, the book is good, and an excellent introduction to Santeria and Candomble.  It also has a section with prayers.  Which are not traditional Orisha prayers, but more a modern \\"New Age\\" style prayers, not commonly used in Casa de Santos, or Ile Houses.  But they are good enough for the beginners to get a jist at various ways to pray and communicate with the Orishas.<br />know it is not the book that is the problem, it is the deck.  It is titled The Orisha Tarot,  but I have to completely disagree with this title.  Okay first of all what do Gnomes,  mermaids and fairies have to do with the wisdom of Orisha and African Spirituality.  NOTHING!!  Yet these images are portrayed abundantly throught the deck.  Also what does Lucifer El Diable have to do with Yoruba wisdom.  Again, nothing, this is a Christian Concept, not an Orisha concept.  In fact their is no spirit of complete evil in our religious philosophies.  Then their is the Karma card.  This has to do with Indian Hindu, not African Yoruba.  This card does not belong their.<br />Also another thing that I found enoying was how the most of the Orishas where portrayed as having white skin. Obatala is white, this is fine, but!! Yemaya, Oya, Oba, Pombagira, are all white.  Eshu is chalk white.  And Ochun and Chango are mulattos.  None of the Orisha are black.  The Babalawo is white.  Also notice how every one who is black seams to be punished or in trouble, such as.  The Outcast, The Enslaved prisoner, and 5 of water.  And also what does a cruise Liner,  8 of water or a Greek building 2 of fire, have to do with Yoruba orisha Spirituality.  NOTHING!!<br />I was so disappointed with this deck.  It had potential, but all of the wisdom and knowledge of Candomble, and Lucumi, is missing.  The Minor Arcana should be dedicated to the ancient paikis of the religion, while the Major to the Orishas, Orixas ect.  As for El karma card, which really anoied me, this should have been Ori.  and the......  Oh why bother torturing my self. Who am I kidding, this deck needs a complete makeover from beginning to end.andomble, and Lucumi, is missing.

The Works of Migene Gonzalez Wippler are the most widely distributed and best selling books on the Subject of Santeria, and Cuban Lucumi.  Her works are both liked and disliked, liked buy the community who are new to Santeria, and very much disliked buy Elders and initiates in the religion.<br />It is not that Wippler's books are not accurate, they are.  It is just that they seam to closely resemble other published books on Lucumi and Santeria that have been written in Spanish and have no copyrights.    But aside from this, \\"if you can put this aside, many of the Elders in the religion, will not.\\"  (That is steeling)  Then you have a pretty interesting book, full of basic wisdom and knowledge that really opens the doors for new comers into the religion, or for those who have a basic curiosity.    \\"I guess those who do not know gotta start somewhere.\\" I recommend it to those who have no knowledge of the religion, it breaks that Voodoo stereo type, but this book is pretty much a stepping stone for other bigger and greater things.  But I do not completely dislike her books, in fact I recommend this book, and Powers of the Orishas, to all Aleyos out there.
The World Spirit Tarot has to be one of the most invocative and beautiful decks I have seen. The artwork is very primitive, and multicultural. You will see hints of Cuban Santeria, Haitian Voudun, Indian Hindu, Native American Shamanism, and it goes on and on. <br />I use this deck for personal meditation, and can not wait to read it to my friends and family members. As a tarot collector, this has become one of my favorites. There are may decks with aswome art, or computerized images that wow you. This deck uses woodblock art to create the deck, and I hear it is a hard process. The art is excellent. If you like the Light and Shadow Tarot. You will love this one. I am not a big fan of Llewellyn publishing, but lately they have been publishing excellent decks. The World Spirit Tarot is destined to be a classic. I mean look at it; it's in the cards<br />I love the World Spirit Tarot so much, and use it frequently, and being Latino, and of course reading for alot of Latino, and Spanish Speaking people I was very happy to learn that the World Spirit Tarot also came in a Spanish verson. The title is Tarot Mistico Universal, and of course can be bought here in Amazon.com, and the number is 1567185282. I Can not Recomend this deck enouph. It is a Powerful deck, and well worth checking out.<BR>I bought the Tarot Mistico, and it is the same as the World Spirit, with the exception that the title are in Spanish and the book comes in Spanish. I Highly Recomend this deck..
When this deck and book set first came out, way back in the 90's, I was very happy and anxious to own the deck.  Finally a tarot deck in homage of the African Orishas.  Boy was I disappointed when I got this deck.  Let me begin with the book, which infect I enjoyed immensely, the book is good, and an excellent introduction to Santeria and Candomble.  It also has a section with prayers.  Which are not traditional Orisha prayers, but more a modern \\"New Age\\" style prayers, not commonly used in Casa de Santos, or Ile Houses.  But they are good enough for the beginners to get a jist at various ways to pray and communicate with the Orishas.<br />know it is not the book that is the problem, it is the deck.  It is titled The Orisha Tarot,  but I have to completely disagree with this title.  Okay first of all what do Gnomes,  mermaids and fairies have to do with the wisdom of Orisha and African Spirituality.  NOTHING!!  Yet these images are portrayed abundantly throught the deck.  Also what does Lucifer El Diable have to do with Yoruba wisdom.  Again, nothing, this is a Christian Concept, not an Orisha concept.  In fact their is no spirit of complete evil in our religious philosophies.  Then their is the Karma card.  This has to do with Indian Hindu, not African Yoruba.  This card does not belong their.<br />Also another thing that I found enoying was how the most of the Orishas where portrayed as having white skin. Obatala is white, this is fine, but!! Yemaya, Oya, Oba, Pombagira, are all white.  Eshu is chalk white.  And Ochun and Chago are mulattos.  None of the Orisha are black.  The Babalawo is white.  Also notice how every one who is black seams to be punished or in trouble, such as.  The Outcast, The Enslaved prisoner, and 5 of water.  And also what does a cruise Liner,  8 of water or a Greek building 2 of fire, have to do with Yoruba orisha Spirituality.  NOTHING!!<br />I was so disappointed with this deck.  It had potential, but all of the wisdom and knowledge of Candomble, and Lucumi, is missing.  The Minor Arcana should be dedicated to the ancient paikis of the religion, while the Major to the Orishas, Orixas ect.  As for El karma card, which really anoied me, this should have been Ori.  and the......  Oh why bother torturing my self.

Dr. Vega has set an important example for all authors of the various Orisha traditions.  She wrote a book on her life experiences not just within her Initiated Rama of Cuban Oricha Lucumi, but also on her experiences with Brazilain Orixa Candomble, and West African Yoruba Orisa Worship.  No where in her book does she mention, how her path is the right way.  Instead she writes on how it is important to unify all the various paths of Orisha worship.  The Body can not run without the legs, and this is what the various Orisha worships are, one part of a whole body, and each one needs the other to survive. <br />I recommend this book to all that have minimal experience or knowledge of the Orisha religions.  This is one of those books that I recommend, because of the beauty and sincerity behind the story.   This is not one of those \\"How To\\" books on Santeria that is the latest trend, but a memoir of a Priestess of the Orisha tradition.
The Osha is an excellent book that will make an excellent handbook to the newly crowned in the Osha Lucumi Tradition.  This is a good book for its information, and should be used with the watchful eye of once Elders.  The Reason being, yes there are allot of rituals, ceremonies, rites and passages revealed.  But for those who have received the ceremonies of Kariocha, \\"the Crowning of their Santo.\\"  They will realize that many of the important key elements of these sacred acts have been left out.   Fact is that Mr. Julio Garcia Cortez being an ordained Babalorisha of Chango, knew that this information could not be written in any book, because this Sacred knowledge is passed down through experience, and it is a sacred act that is passed down from initiated Elder to young Iyawo, and Aborishas.  <br />Yes the book teaches you how to read the coco for the Santos, but it does not tell you how to properly petition Obi, before opening Obi up for consultation.   Also there are set rules before consulting Obi that are not discussed in full detail in this book.  But honestly these are lessons that one learns from their respected godparents in the religion.  <br />For the beginner or those curious of the religion, this book will be curious but strange and alien, none of the Orikis or Orins are translated they are left in Lucumi dialect.   Many of the herb's names are in Spanish, are not fully explained and further study will be needed.  This is just some examples. <br />I recommend this book for those who have received the ceremonies of Kariocha, and for those who have a close bond with their respectful godparents, this is a handbook or lesson book that can be used as a basis for many learning discussions, or as a check back after other minor rituals and ceremonies.
This has to be one of my favorite books by Mrs. Cofer; I loved it so much I read it three times in a row.  The story of the lives of Mama Cielo, her son Guazman and so forth takes you on a journey to Puerto Rico in the earlier part of the 20th century.  The Characters are all interweaved into a World that will captivate you.  Starting in  rural Puerto Rico and then going to the barrios of New York, and back to Puerto Rico.  One takes a journey through the Peasant Puerto Rican life, the mystery and magic of brujeria and Santeriia.   This book has it all, a Novel that reads like one of those most loved, Spanish Telenovelas.  This book is a must read for all Latino, especially to my sister Latinas as this book shows the importance and strength of the Latina woman in the Familia.  Highly Recommended.  I wish they would base a mini TV movie on this book, it would be such a treat. A++++++++++
Every one who is a follower of any Orisha path should learn to consult and communicate with ones ruling Orisha and the Orisha in general.   Everything from small offerings of candles, to coins, and liquor can be given to the Orishas, but first one must consult with them, to see if they except the offerings, and if not, is their anything else, one can give to please them.   But not just with offerings, but in life's trivial pursuits one should consult the Orisha before making any serious decision. <br />Obi is an oracle used buy all followers of Orisha, and many use this ancient oracle to find out yes and no answers to their questions.  But Obi divination is more than that, and it is through this book and the help of ones Godparents that one can begin to learn and understand Obi divination.<br />This book is written in the Lucumi tradition, and it is excellent.  In it you will learn the history of Obi divination in the Americas, you will read Patikis on Obi, Biaque, and the Coconut Tree.  You will learn some of the various Orishas one can communicate with using this ancient oracle.  You learn Lucumi, Mojubares, used prior to consulting with the oracle. You learn the various patterns and their meanings.  This book is beautifully written and well researched.  <br />Ache to Ocha'ni Lele, who is becoming such an important voice in the Orisha traditions of the Americas.   But as the author will state, this is an oracle that should be learned through the hands of an experienced elder in the Tradition.  For further study on this ancient oracle, and for those Aborishas who have the sacred capacity of the orishas, I also recomed these other books on the subject, also sold at Amazon.com.  <BR>Awo Obi: Obi Divination in Theory and Practice 1890157295 and The Little Oracle That Goes a Long Way: Ifa's Obi Abata
This book belongs in every Puerto Riquenios library.  If you where raised in Las montanias of Puerto Rico, or went to visit Abuela or los tios during Summer vacation from school, this book will hit a personal mark.  I have given this book to so many of my friends for Christmas and for birthdays, and so many have related to the story in some form or the other.<br />Esmeralda Santiago is a genius, my mother is not a big reader of books, but I got her the spanish edition, and she was moved into tears, in parts such as the out house, and school lunch in la escuelita, she said that this is the way it was.  As she read it she could not help but be transported back into time, to the days of her childhood.  <br />I love this book so much, and have given it to a few of my white friends, it helps them understand us and to see where we come from.  This book is a mirror into the soul of every boriqua.  My cousin a 7th grade teacher in Puerto Rico uses this book with her students.  It is a must read, and every Puerto Riquenio, no every Latino should read.
Sadly to say Migene Gonzales Wippler has a bad reputation in the Lucumi Tradition, and many give her a really bad rep.  Especially on her books on the religion.  I do not know her personally, and I am not hear to criticize her work.  But to be honest with you it was the books of Mgene Gonzales Wippler that has opened the doors for many Aborishas today.  In fact I know a few Iyawos, and a few Babalorishas and Iyalorishas menores like my self who have stated the same things.   Okay so with that said, she has published two good books and I must say this one is one of them.  I just like it, and I remember it being such a big reference book for me, in those early years of my interest in la religion.   There are no big secrets revealed here, just simple Orishas facts, that are commonly known to many of the various Ramas.    I recommend this book for the beginners, a book that can be past down to the younger generation.  We all have to start somewhere; well this is one of those books to start of with...
You ever go to a Latino's house, and they have a Boveda, (Spirit Altar) and there in the center is a little Old Spanish book of prayers.  And of course it is all in Spanish.  Or you ever go to one of those Well-Known Botanicas in the barrios of the Bronx's, or in Calle Ocho in Florida, and see that that same book with the cross is such a popular favorite.  And you ever wish so badly.  \\"Jeeze I wish they would publish that book in English.\\"  Well wish no more, because the Santos, the Orishas, the Spirits, and the Gods have answered your prayers.   This book if you are Latino is the one that Mama Juana, and Abuelita used, yes the same one that has those beautiful prayers, to Eleggua, Santa Barbara, the Virgen of Guadelupe, the Buddha,  Papa Chango,  La Madama, el Congo Negro, and El Indio Poderoso, and it does not end there, it goes on giving you a whole collection of over 125 translated prayers, many for the first time i English.  <br />If you like working with 7 day jar candles, then this is the book for you.  There are prayers, invocations, and evocation, fro everything for Dominating Occult Enemies, Luck, Love, Protection, and blessings.  This is the actual book that Santeros, Brujos, Curanderos, Paleros,  and Espiritistas from the Caribbean and South America have been using for a long time, and know it is finally written in English for all to enjoy and cherish.    This book is a collection or prayers from various Afro-Latino backgrounds, and if you respect your Christian Santos, Honor your African Orishas, and believe in the luck of the Spirits and the Orient, then this is the book for you.  <br />This collection is basically for the beginners, it helps you learn how to talk to the Santos, in hopes that it will open your conscious mind, and soon you will be able to speak and pray to them straight from the heart.  But it is also good for those with many years of experience.  Enjoy.
One of the most important books of the Spiritism Movement, second only to the book of Spirits, which is considered to be the bible of Spiritism.   This is a book that should be read as in a group setting, a study group of mediums, where people can discuss the contexts, and by doing so learning from it better.    The Book of Mediums, is just that, a guide for mediums on  Spirits, that touches on topics such as Spirit manifestations, Haunting, communicating with Spirits, and invocations.   This is one of those important Books that should be in the personal library of ever mediums, psychics, and student of the occult as well.
This book is okay, and I really do not like to write bad reviews, I hate being a critic to others works.  But since I own this book I felt the need to state my opinion.  Okay this book is a bit confusing and misleading.  It misleads you on the whole Egun section.  As I was reading it, I kept thinking of that old Batman TV commercials.  \\"Same Bat channel, Same Bat station!\\"  These part makes no sense, and it seams kind of foolish First of all time is a concept created buy Mankind, \\"the Living!\\" And it really seams sort of ridiculous thinking your Ancestors run such a tight Time Schedule, that you have to call them at the same time, and if you do not, then you have to start al over.   Where this information came from I do not know.  Sadly many people, who have little knowledge of Orisha Worship or Espiritismo, believe this as fact.  <br />Then there is the section of Yemaya and Olokun and how the author says that Santeria and the Lucumis have seperated and Orisha and created two.  Meaning that Yemaya and Olokun are one and the same.  This is an interesting point, but lets face it, in Africa Olokun is the deity that rules the Ocean depths, while Yemaya is the deity that rules motherhood and water in general.   Also Olokun originated in Benin while Yemaya originated more in Oyo.<br />This book is another book claiming to be more Yoruba, or more Ifa, and of course knocking down Lucumi in the process, but then again if you look at the section on the Boveda, it would be interesting to note that this is a Boveda as constructed in the Lucumi tradition, and not the Yoruba tradition.<br />This book is okay for those interested in \\"New Age American Ifa.\\" ( &quot;You know the kind that recieve Eleggua and Intiations through the Mail.&quot;) But for those who are serious and respectful in the traditions of the Orishas, this book is not completely accurate.
I can not recommend this book enough; I highly recommend it to both the beginners in the religion, as well as those initiated into the mysteries of their particular ruling orisha.  All of Chief Famas books are a must, and if you can get your hands on a copy of this book or any of her other books, get them, because they are not easy to come buy.  This book excellent because you get a collection of traditional Ifa Yoruba prayers to the Orishas, Ori, and the ancestors.  The prayers are in both Yoruba, and translated into English.  Also the 16 Laws of Ifa are touched upon, as well as traditional orikis, as well as a section on food offerings and taboos to some Orishas are also discussed.  There is also a section on the various categories of Ori, which is good to have for reference, and of course a section on the Ibori, which is god and handy.  I highly recommend this book to all Aborishas, to all those who have godparents, this would be also a good gift.  To those who are not initiated nor have any godparents, this book will kind of loose you, because it is a book meant for further study with ones Elders.  This book will appeal to both Orisha followers of West Africa as well as the Americas.  It is a reference book that will defiantly come in handy.
I like this little book, do not get me wrong, it is a good book for the beginners.  But I have a few problems with it.  First of all the name title of the book,  it should be titled the Handbook of Lucumi Religious Concepts, being that this book is more Cuban Santeria Lucumi than African Yoruba.  Initiated Aborishas would be able to tell buy the Osun, Eleggua, name of herbs, los collares, the cantos are Lucumi and not Yoruba, and so forth.  So for that reason alone it can be a little misleading, as for Baba Ifa Karade giving it a Yoruba title.   For those who have little knowledge of the various paths, and are truly interested in Yoruba, this would through them off.    Do not get me wrong, I like this \\"\\"Handbook of Lucumi Concepts, I just dislike the misleading title of the book.  It is a trend these days for people to make the various Ocha ramas more Afro centric, this is not the problem.  The problem is that they deny the importance that the Lucumis have had on opening the doors for them.    But all in all the book is good.  Good for the beginners.
I love the World Spirit Tarot so much, and use it frequently, and being Latino, and of course reading for alot of Latino, and Spanish Speaking people  I was very happy to learn that the World Spirit Tarot also came in a Spanish verson.

Okay, I do not understand how any one could give this deck a bad review; it makes no sense to me.  With all due respect, I guess the individual does not understand the complicity of linoleum block, which is not the same as just drawing a deck, it is much more complex and difficult to work with.  But with all that said, this deck is very strong in it's style.  Yes this is a very big deck, but for one to truly appreciate the art within the cards, it needed to be this big.  I strongly recommend this deck to the beginners as well as the advanced / or collectors.    I am a reader and collector of tarots for many years, and I have used this deck, especially when teaching younger adults or pre-teens.  I bought a few decks, and with my three daughters, (actually one is younger, and I got her the Hello Kitty Tarot) But I got a few of these decks, this past summer and every day we would color the deck with markers.  As we did so we spoke on the meanings of the deck, or what a card meant to one of my daughters.  Happily each Light and Shadow deck became beautifully unique and an art project that gave us much time to spend together.   Also instead of studying the tarot alone, we made it a group project, and learned so much from one another.<br />For that alone I recommend this deck so much.  You will have a deck all your own.  I was saddened to learn that Michael Goepferd the artist of this deck, did not live to see his deck in print, and I hope he can see, that he has created a deck that will defiantly become a classic.
The World Spirit Tarot has to be one of the most invocative and beautiful decks I have seen.  The artwork is very primitive, and multicultural.
