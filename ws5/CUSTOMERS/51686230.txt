From the author, Gerry Leitner: Argentina! The name conjures up visions of the pampas, gauchos and  tango. <br />But Argentina has much more to offer: Argentina is home of the highest  mountain in South America, it shares with Brazil the mighty Iguazu  falls and in the far south it has some awe-inspiring glaciers. But  did you know that the north-western part formed once part of the great  Inca Empire? In fact one of the main Inca trails coming down from  Bolivia traverses the north western altiplano region of Argentina <br />linking many pre-columbian settlements right down to the Province  of Mendoza. Many of which are still waiting for the arrival of the  archeologist. Add to this the many national parks, beaches and backed  up with a very modern infrastructure and you have got the makings  of a wonderful travel destination.<br />This book was written with the intent to give the reader - whether  backpacker or discerning five-star traveler - the most complete view  of this fascinating tourist destination. &quot;Travel Companion Argentina&quot;  was not tied to an accountant's budget: no effort was spared to bring  to my readers the best available information. I have covered at least  90% of all places where either there is something of tourist interest  or there are tourist facilities. I can safely say that my bus information  tables are the most complete: listed are services to even small, distant  places: if there is a bus, frequency, fares, and traveling time are  indicated. Back ground information includes history, economy of provinces  and towns, notes on local dishes and type of food served in restaurants.  Fishing, skiing, white water rafting, mountaineering, bird watching  and how to contact specialist tour operators by phone, fax or even  e-mail, all are covered in this book. The book weighs 12oz; hardly  excessive for the amount of information it contains. <br />So become an &quot;armchair traveler&quot; first reading what my book has to  say about thiswonderful travel destination and then if you feel that  this is what you want to see personally, proceed to make your travel  plan. Yes, with my &quot;Travel Companion Argentina&quot; you can make an almost  perfect travel plan taking into consideration your time available  - and of course the money you wish to spend. And don't forget to take  this travel guide with you in case you want to change some travel  plans on the spot. <br />I hasten to add that Argentina with its climate ranging from the tropics  to subantarctic is a travel destination all year round.
This has to be the most comprehensive guide to Argentina ever written. It's over 1,000 pages, covering the country from top to toe. Over 2,500 locations are profiled - mountains, rivers, preserves, villages, historic sites, cities. What to see and do, where to stay and eat and when to visit. From each main center, you are offered a selection of excursions. Includes thousands of e-mail addresses and useful websites. 24 color maps detail every section of the country. There are also well over 100 street plans for every town of any significance in the country.
Library Journal's review of this guide: &quot;Combining encyclopedic coverage of destinations with loads of practical information and atlas-type maps, the series illuminates the wonders of nature but emphasizes the peculiarity of a place's people and their folklore.&quot;
This `charming' series sparkles with photographs that stress the beauty of the finest - but not necessarily the costliest - small hotels across Europe (by country). Most hotels get a full page with a clear, revealing photograph, one or two beautifully written descriptive paragraphs and a shaded section with contact info, prices, etc. (Library Journal)

There are other guides to Argentina, but this is the one I will take on my next visit. The author has visited Argentina more than 40 times, obvious from the wealth                 of information he gives you.
A very thorough guide.... This is definitely the book to take with you to Atlantic Canada.
I've been toting Elizabeth L. Dugger's  new Adventure Guide to  Massachusetts &amp; Western  Connecticut around for about a month  now, ever since I received it. I had all the best intentions of  being the first  reviewer to publish my  commentary on the travel guide, but with  one  project after another eating up my  hours, I'm not sure that I can claim  that  honor. I have, however, really bulked  up my biceps by lugging the  Adventure  Guide around!<br /> In a word, the book is &quot;massive,&quot; and   before I ever lifted the cover, I was  perplexed as to how Dugger could   possibly have found enough bungee  jumping-, cliff diving-, and vine   swinging-type adventures in the stately  and somewhat subdued states of   Massachusetts and Connecticut to fill  496 pages! When I opened to page 113   to find a section on &quot;Antique Shopping  on Cape Cod,&quot; I was  surprised and  delighted to realize that the range of  adventures Dugger  suggests includes  those that pose great danger only to my  credit card  balance.<br /> In the book's introduction, Dugger  explains that adventure  travel &quot;doesn't  have to mean hanging from a cliff by  your  fingernails. &quot; Her enormous catalog  of exciting escapes includes   family-friendly ideas, outdoor fun for  people of all ages and abilities,   out-of-the-ordinary sightseeing  suggestions, and, of course, the full   complement of hiking, biking, fishing,  boating, and other recreational   opportunities in central New England.  &quot;Adventure travel makes you  feel alive,  wakes you up to yourself as well as to  your  surroundings,&quot; Dugger explains.  &quot;Just being in open lands or  along the  coast, most of the time, can give you that  get-away feeling.  ...Adventure travel  gets the blood flowing, the heart  pumping.&quot;<br />  Also the author of the Adventure Guide  to New Hampshire and the Adventure   Guide to Vermont, Dugger quickly  debunks the notion that Massachusetts is   a tamer, less challenging playground than  its mountainous northern  neighbors.                                      After a brief introductory  section that includes a short history of  Massachusetts, a map of and  information on getting to the region, road  rules, and safety information  on such important topics as &quot;avoiding bears,&quot;  the book is broken  up into six regional chapters: the Seacoast Region,  Boston and Nearby  Adventures, Central Massachusetts, the Pioneer  Valley, the Berkshires, and  the Litchfield Hills of Connecticut. Within each  geographic section,  adventures are organized in category groupings: On  Foot, On Horseback, On  Wheels, On Water, On Snow &amp; Ice, and In the  Air. Each chapter has  information on Eco-Travel and where to Stay &amp; Eat,  as well.<br /> While  the emphasis of this guide is decidedly on the outdoors and on  planning a  Massachusetts vacation that takes you to the lesser known  attractions that  the state offers, it is actually one of the most comprehensive  and  delightful guides to the region available. While many travel guides   contain the obligatory paragraph on each historic attraction and  sightseeing  venue, the Adventure Guide to Massachusetts &amp; Western  Connecticut  artfully leads the traveler to those awe-inspiring,  stimulating, and unique  excursions that are likely to make for a most  memorable trip. Detailed  maps, black and white photos, cute graphics, and  sidebars on special  events, kid-friendly and accessible spots, recommended  reading, and more  break up the text and make it easier for the reader to  find terrific tips, even  when simply skimming.<br /> In just a quick flip  through the book, I uncovered a bed &amp; breakfast just  for women (Little  River Farm in Worthington, MA, 413-238-4261), a  cemetery famous for its  art and sculpture (The Forest Hills Cemetery in  Boston, 617-524-0703), and  a horseback riding outfit on the beaches of  Cape Cod (Nelson's,  508-487-1112).<br /> Dugger's enthusiasm for sharing the region's best  treasures percolates from  every page, and as I've spent time reading her  detailed descriptions of  everything from trekking with llamas in Great  Barrington to sea kayaking in  Plymouth Harbor, I've been constantly  compelled to ask myself what in the  world I'm doing here on the couch with  a book when all of these  adventures lie just a short drive away!<br /> If you  live within easy driving distance of Massachusetts and Western   Connecticut, Dugger's Adventure Guide for this region will provide an   ever-flowing stream of inspiration and encourage you to explore the   wonders we sometimes overlook. And, if you're planning only a short visit   to this part of the world, the guide will ensure that your moments in   Massachusetts are among your most exhilarating and enjoyable.
Those planning a journey will consider the specific information a treasure trove of facts. From critically acclaimed accommodations to itineraries and a focus on                 wildlife, this is packed with take-along  information essential to planning a visit.
