So far, I've read all eleven Left Behind novels, and while they are not perfect, I think that some people don't give it enough credit because of unfair comparisons.  People often point to We All Fall Down and The Christ Clone trilogy as better novels, and in a way, they are, but they are also very different.  Left Behind seems to be more of an introduction to the subject of the End Times, a series that is reaching out to all people of different ages.  It's not particularly well written, but it is clear and straightforward.  The characters are not particularly realistic or interesting, but these are not character studies, these are novels that are trying to give people an overview of this concept, and they do that quite well.<br />To compare these to other novels with similar themes is a little bit unfair.  We All Fall Down is much better written and more intelligent, but the focus of that novel is much more intensley spiritual and more of a character study that uses the End Times as a backdrop to explore complex issues of evil and salvation.  It is for more mature, serious readers and it's aim is very different from Left Behind.  Likewise, The Christ Clone is more of a techno-thriller, interested in exploring how, realistically the End Times could arive.  I will admit that I enjoyed these other books more than Left Behind, but that does not take away from the fact that Left Behind still does a decent job with the subject.  They are not great novels, but they are nowhere near as bad as some people are saying.
