When I read words from Michael Crichton, I can visualize them all. I imagine visually the entire story. His stories are technical and flowing. This book is highly recommended. I won't bother to tell you about the book  because you should read without knowing to make it more exciting. This book  is for techincal thinkers who can visualize.

When I wised up and began to read for pleasure (School always made it difficult for me to enjoy books. I hated to have to read.). Not one Michael Crichton book has let me down.<br />As usual, I would suggest you not find  out about this book just read it. Reading a book is more exciting when you  have no idea what's inside. I assure you it's a great read for the  technically minded individual who can visual what is read.
I was watching this talk show one day and J. K. Rowling was there. This was apparently one of her first interviews. Might have been her first flight to the states. She was on the Rosie Odonnell (sp) show. Rosie loved  the book and was ranting on (in a good way) about how this book is a  classic in the making. On how she was on the edge of her chair with every  word. Rosie even read this book to her children. After I heard J. K.  Rowling talk. After she explained how poor she was and how she just had a  dream of writing something. How she sent this book to publishers, each one  an original because she couldn't afford to get them copied. This lady has  real vision and I admire this. After hearing her speak, I decided that I  had to read this book. I LOVE THIS BOOK! It's a good read for all ages who  know how to day dream when they read. I'm not going to get into the story  of the book because I am a firm believer that you should read something  without knowing anything. It's more exciting that way. Just trust me and  read the book. Oh, email me when you finished the book and tell me how you  like it. :-) chris@gigglecam.com
If you haven't read book 1, 2 and 3 then you should do so before reading this book. All previous stories and discoveries are revealed in this book. Other than the thickness of the book (hard to read in the bath tub.  giggle), I LOVED IT. As I do the others. Will there be more? <br />Oh, this is  the first book (EVER) that I cried about. (A happy cry) I love moral  fiber!
If you haven't read book 1 &amp; 2 then I would suggest you read them first. The story line flows through each book and the preceding book goes  over the previous books plot and discovery. This is a fabulous book. Just  like 1 and 2.
Hey, if you haven't read the first Harry Potter book then go read it before you read this one. Book 2 gives all the mystery away of book one. Book 2 is a fabulous read, but it's much much much better if you read book  1 first. And, if you have read book one, then you shouldn't even be reading  the reviews, you should already be reading the book (giggle). As always J.  K. Rowling does a fabulous job of giving me another visual read.
