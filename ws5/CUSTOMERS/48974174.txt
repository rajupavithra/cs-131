Wilhem Reich was an influential psychoanalyst and thinker whose work has greatly influnced many practitioners and theoreticians of psychotherapy, psychology and psychoanalysis. He was a member of Freud's circle but like many before and after him broke free from his influence later on. His analysis on fascism can be considered as seminal and has influenced amongst others Theodore Adorno in his work for the Princeton institute. His insights into how the human body is inseparable from the human human psychic have also had a great influence on therapeutic practise. He postulated that the various phobias, neurosis and mood disorders have a direct effect on ones body both on the physiological level (internally in the organism) and on the overall posture and facial expressions, and saw Freud's attempts at bringing about change with the sole use of language ('the talking cure') as, to say the least, problematic and insufficient. He, on the other hand, believed that one can go the other way round and make changes at the overall posture which will in turn help resolve the inner psychic conflicts, thus bringing in a whole new perspective to therapy. The several years he spend in the U.S. where primarily conserned with 'orgone energy', a term that he coined for the everlasting, unchangeable energy that permeates the universe and is the source of healing, something like Freud's libido but in more broader cosmic terms, or Bergson's elan vitale. <br />Falling victim of the U.S. goverments witch-hunt at that period, the vile fanaticism and hatred that they intilled in people against his research, and the smearing campains that went on against him personaly, he was finaly incarcerated, his institute broken apart, his research papers and other documents confiscated and burned. He finally died in prison in 1957, a horrible, undeserved end for such a human being.<br />This book was written in hot blood in 1947, 10 years that is before his demise, and it is a pamphlet, a critique, a rant, a vibrant piece of history in the making. It was not meant to be published but later on was in fact published as Reich's defence for the atrocieties commited against him. Reich here focusses on the individual, the little man of the title, who is lead to believe this and that by the powers that be, and never who assumes his responsibilities for his own life and freedom. It is a powerfull text in every possible sense. Reich rallies against the &quot;sentimental plague&quot;, the propaganda of his time, and makes a call to arms to anyone who is willing to listen, to stop being the little man, or a big little man of fame and fortune, and to become what he is meant to be, an aware, responsible, lively individual. It is an inspiring short piece more poetical than philosophical, more political than psychological. I would recommend it a primer to E. Fromm's escape from freedom and to any existential writing for that matter.<br />Reich in the end is optimistic. Unlike Giacomo Leopardi whose thought abounds as an influence to this book (although i doubt that Reich ever read Leopardi), Reich believes that in the centuries to come men and women will finaly assume this responsibilities and rise above the &quot;mass&quot; the &quot;common man&quot; in a more free, egalitarian, honest future.<br />Read it for yourself, be inspired, and what is more...act on it.
What can I say about this book? It is a poorly written fable, with a little vacant glimmer of hope for all. New age hollowness. With sinister authoritarian undertones planted in an all too subtle way. Oh, the preaching goes on and on and on, covert and ever so potent. Make everyone think like a 6 year old Coelho and become a millionaire in the process, go on, cancel out all the western tradition of thought with your new agey bubbles. This is a very profound book on...well I don't know what it is profound on but it is still very deep. Ah, I figured it, life that's the topic of the book, the big L.<br />But people seem to like it so I better shut up fore they follow their dream of forcing the ones they don't agree with to shut up. (Just a question if two dreams cause conflict, say in a conflict of dreams, does the universe split in half to favour both, or if a dream becomes reality then does the universe no longer conspire and it has to become a dream again for it to happen, or if you dream a lot at night and wake up and don't remember your dream should you see a witch doctor about it, or if one is a dreamer and follows his heart and wonders off to the mecicine cabin of the medicine man and then the man with the long wooden stick tells him...but that's another tale.) Thanks for reading.
I 'd like to further the discussion for this book by posting my thoughts about it. As others have mentioned, the booklist review is all together bigoted, slanted and shallow and should be disregarded by any self-respecting reader. If however one analyses this review with a more critical eye one can detect an impressive wealth of ill-founded and vacant rhetoric that serves the sole purpose of such reviews, i.e. to further the causes of their writer against free speech and the (relatively) objective circulation of thought and information, which is precisely the point that dr. Michael Parenti is trying to make in this and other books of his. I will petition the reader's and amazon's patience to go into it in just a few lines as it is such a good case in point of all that Parenti is rallying against.<br />Parenti is labeled a &quot;self-styled &quot;progressive&quot; thinker&quot; and his work &quot;one-sided&quot; and &quot;emotional&quot;. For me to be self-styled is the only way to go and far better than being other-people-interests-styled, and the quotes on progressive serve well to subtly convey the contempt at the very begging of this article, with no more than four words coming before that (Mr. Jay Freeman, his name an irony in itself, does not feel his readers ought to know the reasons for his scorn, just accept it per se with no prior justification.) The claim of it being &quot;one-sided&quot; is another rhetoric device. Who is not one sided, who does not have just his own side to write about, any contrary claim to that would imply that the author could and should and must be ubiquitous and rise above themselves as if they were a type of higher essence, a mere medium for a higher order of ideas. The later claim of emotionality goes unjustified as well. And that's only the firt two lines folks! He then name drops &quot;paranoia&quot;, &quot;dogmatic&quot; and &quot;absurdity&quot; to tie the whole thing together with empty and sterile stereotyping. The coup de grace comes with the mental image mr. Freeman constructs for dr. Parenti as being a &quot;mind hog-tied by ideology&quot;, as if he himself had no ideology of his own, and &quot;hog-tied&quot;... how bile and fearful and slandering can a reviewer get. This is is insulting.<br />To do justice to the book is to say that it is at least revealing, well thought out and well written. Parenti writes in a clear and spirited tone, managing to be at the same time, a popularizer of complex issues, an informed scholar and last but certainly not least an inspiration for social action and change, being the activist he is. This series of essays cannnot be labeled &quot;leftist&quot; because this would reductionist to say the least, they are the words of a person favouring the egalitarian and democratic future that we all should aspire to. And how can we further this cause failing to understand how our distant and not-so-distant history comes to be, if we do not learn how to think as Parenti said in one of his lectures &quot;systemically&quot;, i.e. to see the whole picture, the whole frame of reference and not the unimportant bits and pieces of information the media supply as with. (?) The answer is we cannot. <br />I urge you to read dr. Parenti's books for all their profound analysis, scholarship and humor and for their value at instigating social struggles and change. And listen to him live if you can, he is a remarkable speaker.<br />Thanks for your time and patience, and to amazon for offering a space for free and radical discussion.

This book is a valuable little inventory of coercive techniques and strategies used by the various traders, promoters, marketers to sell their products (whatever these may be..)in a turn of the century late free market capitalist society, namely the US.Ranging from hand-to-hand selling of products and nlp, shopping mall &quot;atmospherics&quot; and the mass &quot;spectacles&quot;, to public relations brief basics, advertising cults (the most insightful section of the book with a well thought out and detailed analysis of how a cult operates in principle and how the different brand names aim for cult-dom), &quot;pyramids&quot; (systems of organization where the benefits remain in the top of the so called pyramid and the rest of the elements at the lower levels work for the sole benefit of those at the top) and an intro to virtual marketing. So far, so good.<br />My main qualm about the book though is the confusion that the author seems to be in (I cannot phrase any better). I will explain what i mean. With some good editing this book could have been cut down to 1/3, leaving out all the unimportant case histories (stories of friends and acquaintances of the author) that do not help illustrate the points the author is trying to make, the self-referential info and Rushkoff's &quot;dear-diary&quot;  ponderings. It could then have been a near perfect overview of the techniques and going by the name of &quot;coercive techniques&quot; instead. But if one selects the austere title &quot;coercion&quot; for his book then the reader is justified to expect a much more analytical, in-depth analysis of the nature of coercion as it is enforced in free market economies of today (or at least a clear ideological stance from the part of the author, and not find at the very end of his book driving through an upper-class neighborhood in his yuppie friend's car asking himself if he himself could use some of the luxury and security that a successful business man savors.) <br />So, if you are looking for the inventory and are willing to plough through the book to get to it then go ahead, no prob. If however you interested in a concise social commentary then you most probably need look elsewhere in the social sciences. I personally found this book lacking in many respects but I do not regret having bought it. I just think that coercive techniques, manipulative corporations and traders are just a product of a socioeconomic system and not the cause of it, and that to protect oneself from the alienating effects of such methods one need not know the methods themselves but have a strong viewpoint on the workings of the system as a whole and distance his or her self from the manic consumer mentality.
Hmm... I read this book during my early adolescence while at high school and I was surprised and bewildered and perplexed. I then got involved in reading it for a second time whilst looking out for other works by this writer, the short stories and &quot;Franny and Zooey&quot;, I even wrote a class assignment essay about it and later on at the University I put myself through the tortuous task of authoring an overview of J.D. Salinger's work, his main themes and preoccupations. I seem to have misplaced both of them and cannot find them, and I stand as speechless as I did the first time I acquainted myself with the author.<br />What I can say with certainty, is that this novel is Art in every sense, not a character sketch per se, not an alienation novel either, but a work of art that masterfully eludes all criticism in that it cannot be contained in one person's critical viewpoint without having a fundamental element of the book being overlooked and compromised in the process of analysis. My tentative observation, at this point in life, is that it is a prolonged haiku, a meditation on being young, idealistic and confused, a delicately drawn between-the-lines depiction of an uncaring, and hypocritical (&quot;phony&quot;) society afflicting the sensitive individual with both its vices and virtues, a starting point for endless adolescent discussion. But I would also like say to all young readers out there to not take this book too seriously, it can be as deadening and nihilistic as it can be sensitizing and sincere. Salinger is very talented writer but he is also deeply uncertain and troublesome, enigmatic as well as poetic, self-defeating in his world view, caring for the world and despising it at the same time, of this world and unable to live in this world or compromise even a minute part of his thoughts for a greater community value, a religion, a philosophical system of thought, a human relation, a cause etc.<br />Good God (and this is only a figure of speech.), thatwas tiresome. Keep an open mind and doubt mostly everything. Good luck with reading this book.
Martin Amis for me is still an open question. With more spunk and bile than any of his contemporaries, with an enormous gift of language as well as an ear for it, learned and &quot;post-modern&quot;.<br />Yet this writer has only written one really great novel, &quot;money&quot;, a few terrible, thin, derrivative first novels, a verbose and over-indulgent &quot;London Fields&quot;, and an inexplicable bad taste, time-reversed, holocaust portrayal in &quot;Times Arrow&quot;. (as well as a premature over-literary attempt at an autobiography by the name of &quot;experience&quot;.)<br />True, his satire is unmistable and his prose polished and sharp. But although I have enjoyed several passages of this book, including this highly constructed, lengthy and artificial one, I have never pondered whilst reading his book on any thought marginally relevant to humanity or even slightly revealing about human nature, or history, or society etc. I 've read so much of his work simply for the allure of the language (including the haunting, again due to the prose only, &quot;night train&quot;.) <br />And I am still wondering, what's getting in the way of the timeless work of literature still waiting to appear from this undoudtedly gifted writer. Is it vanity and narcissism that bogs him, is it the moral vacuum and elitist world-view, is it the reluctance to disclose any of his most treasured thoughts. In his interviews he is parsimonious, one simply cannot tell. Is it perhaps that he is only a stylist and not a thinker.<br />This book is not bad, it could have used some editing, but it is not bad as is, it is not good either, it is a big fat nothing, with plenty of literary devices, sub-plots, masterfully drawn minor characters, and some of the best sentences (stylistically speaking) that you may have read. I can't figure it out, perhaps the words have drawn all the attention to themselves, form over content. My questions still remain.<br />P.S. The astrological musings are laughable.
The idea, what if we could reverse the ills and atrocities of mankind is a romantic one. Vonnegut's dream sequence in slauterhouse five is inspired. Amis's literary mockery of such a horrific historical event with innumerable people dead is nothing but a disgrace. I cannot believe how many amazon readers have written good reviews about this book...If the holocaust can be treated as lightly, a mere showcase for the talents of this guy, and have just a few people object to it then I am afraid that humanity is in for much worse...When this book was first published, and being an avid reader and admirer of amis's stylistics I went and bought it not very much aware of the subject matter. I was shocked and disgusted to find out that the holocaust had just received a pre-adolescent &quot;I bet ya I can pull it off&quot; make-over. (Amis recently mentioned in an interview that he plans to write a historical study of Stalin's dead at the Siberian ghula, how about that for stubborness, consistency and a hidden agenda?)
In a few words, disturbing, over-indulgent, misogynist, homophobic, sadist twaddle. And completely, unbeliavably pointless. (The part were the loathsome protagonist forces himself on his mentally unstable half-sister who then commits suicide was outrageous, how can anyone enjoy reading such a book is beyond me.)
A question to you all.<br />Isn't Wit's basic premise about language and truth just a slant on Sausseurian linguistics with lots of blather and a critique of his (Wit's) prior incarnation in the Tractatus? (the tractatus being the single most pseudo and naive work in the history of phi in my opinion and Wit's first book.)
I read this rather lenghty book in two consecutive days, immersed in Park's looping, breathtaking, inner monologue, stream of conscience writing. This novel is about an obsessive love afair, a troubled, alienated, at times self-loathing academic with his heart not in the academic game show at all, a tale about the &quot;other&quot; as another reviewer succintly put it, about the complexities of life and the self, and more. A tour de force for this remarkable but underrated writer, with a writing style unlike anything you 've read recently, managing to be literary without being tedius and artificial(see m. amis, pynchon, barth et al.for that), and a striking, powerful ending. Park's musings on life and philosophy, european history and themes are never out of place or turgid, and they make very good reading material, adding a texture to the words.<br />Caught up in an unsatisfying marriage, a dead-end lifeless job, a failed yet once passionate and potentialy life-changing love affair, conflicting feelings and instability, Jerry the protagonist somehow agrees to take a trip to the European parliament to express his disagreement with the wage cuts on his job, which he does not particularly like, with a few fellow academics and a number of female students at his Italian university, and, of course, the french woman who is the cause (or is she just the pretext) for his recent worries. Riding on a bus through Europe and at the same time travelling intensely in his thoughts and memories, Jerry Marlow finds himself thinking more and living less in the present. While all too human interaction takes place, he stays a shadowy figure for the most part of the book for any outsiders to his consciousness. Memory mingles with outer reality, obsession takes hold of him, until they finally arrive to their destination (to his destination possibly) where the last act is played. <br />The mental images from the various settings of the book come back to me very vividly as I write these lines. This is a really good book and I am not going to spoil it any more for you with my mediocre analysis. I hope I made clear that this is not your average type of novel. <br />Do read it.
A thought-provoking and revealing book about human life and human interactions. Although written in the late sixties it is still very much relevant and not in the least outdated. Even if you do not accept the script theory as a whole (the system of thought with its jargon(which by the way is minimal compared to other theories of personality) and with the common myths that permeate it), this book provides valuable insights in many aspects of the human condition. Unlike other psychology books that present systems of thought attempting to encompass the whole spectrum of human life and end up missing out on all the finer detail by means of over-generalizations and an over-inflated writer's ego, this one uses the script theory ( that we all decide on important matters in our life at a very young age and live or act out our scripts accordingly)as a springboard for very profound ideas and observations put to paper in a simple and to-the-point language, revealing as I said rather than covering up with theoretical constructs and obscuring. <br />A work by a very compassionate man and a pioneer in the field, who sadly passed away soon after the completion of the book. But as his heritage to people this book is as good as any, and better.
I would like to say a few things about this book and the &quot;genre&quot;, the category it fits in, the self help books in general, mainly because each text is a product of its format and its style greatly influences its content. <br />As with many, if not all, so called self help books this book is marred the following key problems or flaws:<br />1. It states and then repeats over and over again, overemphasizing to the point of tedium, the obvious and the common sense wisdom, failing to capture the finer details of the proposed subject and thus missing out on all the important variations of life. In this way it midguides the reader, forcing them to believe that the theory is the life they live in and that the map is indeed the territory. <br />2. It uses in mostly anecdotal (i.e. incidental) evidence and no scientific, philosophical, literary or other basis as a foundation and is thus very unreliable in the information it provides and can only justify its title (i.e. that it is actually helpful for oneself) if the reader accepts the whole system of thought and frame of mind of the author, his beliefs and values, his or her personal history and assigned meaning in life etc, otherwise it is useless. Missing out on the finer details as i mentioned in the first point i made, these book actually demand that the person replicates his or her self as an offshoot of the writer, allowing for little variety and imagination, and creative spirit, in life. The &quot;wisdom&quot; one can possess after reading such books can be found elsewhere in a more scientific and sinsere manner. Which brings me on to my next point.<br />3. These types of books are full of misconceptions and oversimplifications of psychological, philosophical, religious and otherwise spiritual works. They gratuitously ransack the good library books from their knowledge and wisdom and, with no references, they go about incorporating these elements to their own writing with different name tags or slightly modified content. Hence, the skill to read and understand any form of printed material, ranging from literature to poetry and from philosophy to science, and being able to adjust these skills to the text one is reading, becomes renamed as speed reading and most recently mutates to kevin treudau's ( i don't know if i 've spelt the name correctly) photoreading. Hypnosis skills get a yuppie make-over and turn into nlp, or some new age crap.<br />4. Most of them attempt to change the readers mind frame with positive hypnosis and affirmations and do not provide a long lasting effect so to speak, so it is not the info they provide that causes any effect one might have but the influence it exerts on the reader<br />5. Lastly, and this is a key point I am trying to make here, they are nothing but huge public relations enterprises, as other reviewers have mentioned before me, with the sole purpose of making the author rich and famous and his or her books best-sellers.<br />There are plenty other flaws one can point out but I 'll stay with these due to the lack of time and space.<br />About this book in particular. It is priviled enough to have each and every one of the above errors and a few unique ones.  First of all, the author is in many cases patronising and bosses the reader around into believing his claims. I wonder is such a relationship or reader and auhor, one of command and subordination an &quot;empowering&quot; one to use one of the most loved terms of Covey. When I first read it in my public library I was astounded at how much of this book reads as gospel, a sacred definitive text on the human condition. With not a hint of distrust towards the validity of its claims or its0 historicity (i.e. it being just a product of a certain time and place, a society and a culture, an individual and hir or her souroundings.) For god's sake, even the number seven has mythical connotations as it is a &quot;magic&quot; symbolic number one finds in various cultures around the world. The main ideas of the book, the responsibility of the individual - a main existential idea of choice and commitment one can fully understand, grasp and practise in the works of sartre, neitsche, heidegger, ortega y gasset et al in philosophy and frankl, binswater, rollo may et al. (in fact Covey name drops some of this existential thinkers in but in a fragmeted, quotes out of context fashion) in existential psycotherapy, the second habit the one of &quot;begining with the end in mind&quot; and commiting themselves and &quot;personal meaning&quot; is again an existential offshoot and over-simplification of the human task to enhance the self, act rather than be acted upon, and assigning meaning to ones life, the third one &quot;first things first&quot; i.e. applying some sort of perspective in ones life and prioritizing is just plain common sense and i will not go in it, the next one to think win win, to care for your relationships with other people is straight forward moralism with no substance if applied the way he understands it and to care for the others as a means of achieving your goal of success is just too opportunistic and deceitful for my tastes, next listen empathically - well, well that's an original thought bravo mr. covey now how long did it take you to come to this conclusion, well, not enough space left due to the 1000 word limit, anyway you can imagine the rest...<br />This book as any other this talentless hack has written is an insult to the human mind and complexity, it chews and digests a wealth of knowledge, our human testament, and spits out an incoherent blather to the reader.  Please, if you are not the narrow-minded yuppie sell-out success and control freak, but a wel meaning human being in every sense do not read this, or skim through it at the library at least. Try literature, or theatre or a good therapist or a good friend, or buy a book on existential psychology.<br />Thanks a lot to amazon for the space and to you for your time and effort, hope this review has something to say
Moreover, what really impressed me in this book is,  the fact that the writer avoids falling back on a series of taxonimical chapters, with categories and historical trivia, and attempts to go to the heart of the matter by offering a synthesis of theories whilst at the same time presenting the key concerns of the whole cannon of theory. In short, this is not a book about dry, solidified academic knoweledge, nor a list of names of theorists and theories useful for one to flaunt over dinner conversations, but rather an initiation to a way of thinking and questioning norms and modes of operation with respect to literature, life, reality, meaning and so on and so forth. The authors writing style is clear and accesible, although it is not easy since books on complex issues are not meant to be easy but dense and rewarding if read attentively. Do read this book, and with an opened mind, if you can find it. Thanks to amazon for the space and to you for your time.<br />Dotore.
