People may quivvel about the turn of events in Bantock's series and yet, ambiguity was always what made it work - in addition to some stunning artwork.  I would have been satisfied (and was for years) with the initial trilogy...I did not want to know anymore - or so I thought - Bantock's power lies in the fact that he is an excellent author - has a unique premise and we want to know more.  So it may have not turned the way one wished but, we are all still thinking.  This was certainly not my favorite book, however, I was still compelled and still am.  I told myself I would read nothing past the trilogy...stuck to it and it may have been wise...yet, nothing can be taken from Bantock - he is a master of a craft no one knows or, better yet could even concieve.
While the poetry in this anthology deserves note, the ILP (International Library of Poetry) is exploitative and preys on the novice/unpublished poet.  They achieve this rather neatly by promising to publish almost anyone (those deserving and those not) just to secure 'pre-booked' orders for their works.  Even at that, if one wants to be 'published', ILP will do it for you; however, be careful of what you do or purchase from them. They are certainly 'for-profit' and think little of the authors that place faith in them.  I can't deny that some of the work is very good...but I can say I wouldn't fund them with a dime.  If you have it, enjoy it...if not, do not justify them with your $'s.  I am published in a few of their anthologies but, I would never suggest someone purchase one!  My apologies to the substantial artists in their texts.
