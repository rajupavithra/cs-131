G. Edward Griffin hits a homerun with this book.  It is amazing how little people know about this unaccountable and unconstitutional organization.  <br />This interest bearing national debt is a fraud.  The federal reserve is not federal and it has no reserves.  Basically, a private corporation has  the power to create money out of thin air.  If you or I did that we would  be charged with counterfeiting.  The FED even admits that they are a  private entity.  I know a guy who tried to get info from them under the  Freedom of Information Act, and they responded by telling him they were not  subject to the FOIA because they are a private group.  Amazing!  <br />Get on  your local radio talk shows when politicians are on and find out their  knowledge and position on the Federal Reserve.  Some politicians are  ignorant of how the FED plays the game and some are complicit in helping  the game continue.  <br />We need to return the issuing power of money back to  congress in accordance with the constitution.  Mr. Griffin spells out great  solutions at the end of his book.  It would be beneficial for the money to  be linked to silver with gold reserves in place to deal with major market  shifts.  <br />To the reviewer who tells us to be wary of Mr. Griffin because  he is connected to the John Birch Society, SO WHAT!  Does that negate what  he says or what is documented in his book.  Did you even read it?  I doubt  you did.  Your mentality is just like that of an uneducated bigot.  Watch  out, &quot;He is black so there must be crime afoot.  She is latino so  there must be laziness afoot.&quot;  <br />Get this book and read it.  There  are a lot of good articles and stories about the Federal Reserve on the net  as well.  Education and action are key...
I have mixed feelings about Michael Jordan.  On the one hand, he is a great athlete.  I respect his work ethic.  He has turned in a number of great performances and is no doubt one of the greatest to have ever played the game of basketball.<br />There is a flipside.  Michael Jordan got all  kinds of special treatment while he was in the NBA.  He was the first  player I noticed who was granted all kinds of trips to the charity stripe  because of unbelievably, ticky tack calls.  He scored at least ten points a  game at the free throw line from bogus calls.  It was great when there was  a picture session for 'greats of the game' with Larry Bird, Magic Johnson,  and Michael Jordan.  Magic told Larry not to stand too close to Michael or  they might call a foul.  In front of reporters and television viewers, that  was a classic comment by Magic.  I believe Mike got 99% of all calls in his  favor because he was such a cash cow for the NBA.  Dominique Wilkins was  robbed of a slam dunk championship when Mike scored a perfect 50 doing the  same dunk Dr. J did years before.  I doubt Dr. J ever received a perfect 50  for it.  Dominique's dunk was much more impressive, and he received a 49.5.   Please.  Mike got in a fight with Reggie Miller, and only Miller got  suspended at first.  Only after there was an outcry did Mike get suspended.   How are Mike's punches different?  Mike elbowed Kevin Johnson to the  ground for all to see, and Kevin was called for blocking! <br />I am not too  impressed that the bulls beat the lakers in the NBA finals.  Magic was  double teamed every game every minute he was in.  On top of that, James  Worthy and Byron Scott were injured.  Magic and Larry never won three  championships in a row because the competition, teams, and players in the  80s were much better than the nineties.  Luc Longley, Will Perdue, Bill  Cartwright, or Bill Wennington stopping Kareem?  Ha!  <br />Sport Magazine  recently had a piece on the ten greatest moments and ten greatest players  ever in the NBA.  Mike was ranked number one all time player.  Kudos to  Mike for mentioning in 'For the love of the game' that to pick a  &quot;greatest ever&quot; is impossible because of all the different eras  and evolutions of basketball.  The nineties bulls were given three of the  ten greatest moments in NBA history.  This is just more Mike bias.  Give me  a break.  There are hundreds of classic and amazing moments in NBA history.   One of the moments picked was Mike beating the Jazz in the final minutes  of his last game.  He put his hand on Bryon Russel's backside and shoved  him out of the way.  Then Mike made the game winnig shot.  All eyes were on  Mike, but the ref did not make the obvious call.  <br />There is also Mike's  arrogance.  According to him, Wilt Chamberlain was a fluke eventhough Wilt  was a great all around player.  He made a comment about Magic and Larry  reaching a 'certain level of greatness' and that the two were not good on  defense.  What?  Are we talking about the same Larry Bird?  Shaquille Oneal  is also much better and much improved than Mike gives him credit for.  Shaq  has turned into a solid defender, passer, and he works hard at both ends of  the floor.  <br />Mike's corporate poster boy behavior is laughable.  He did  ads for AT&amp;T and then MCI.  The Wayans family is also split between the  two companies.  Mike talked about the enviroment in Rayovac ads and then  pitches hot dogs?  Mike is not the only athlete who will pitch anything and  everything to make millions.  I wonder if Mike has checked into Nike's  labor practices.<br />Players like Mike and Charles Barkley soured me on  the  NBA.  Charles played like a thug and got away with it because he was a  star.  Plus, Charles insisted on wearing number 34 at Philadelphia  eventhough it was retired for NBA great Billy Cunningham.  The star  treatment and inflated egos has grown old, and that has turned a lot of  people off to sports.  I miss the Lakers and Celtics match ups of the  1980s.

Magic and Larry never won three  championships in a row because the competition, teams, and players in the  80s were much better than the nineties.  Luc Longley, Will Perdue, Bill  Cartwright, or Bill Wennington stopping Kareem?  Ha!  <br />Sport Magazine  recently had a piece on the ten greatest moments and ten greatest players  ever in the NBA.  Mike was ranked number one all time player.  Kudos to  Mike for mentioning in 'For the love of the game' that to pick a  &quot;greatest ever&quot; is impossible because of all the different eras  and evolutions of basketball.  The nineties bulls were given three of the  ten greatest moments in NBA history.  This is just more Mike bias.  Give me  a break.  There are hundreds of classic and amazing moments in NBA history.   One of the moments picked was Mike beating the Jazz in the final minutes  of his last game.  He put his hand on Bryon Russel's backside and shoved  him out of the way.  Then Mike made the game winnig shot.  All eyes were on  Mike, but the ref did not make the obvious call.  <br />There is also Mike's  arrogance.  According to him, Wilt Chamberlain was a fluke eventhough Wilt  was a great all around player.  He made a comment about Magic and Larry  reaching a 'certain level of greatness' and that the two were not good on  defense.  What?  Are we talking about the same Larry Bird?  Shaquille Oneal  is also much better and much improved than Mike gives him credit for.  Shaq  has turned into a solid defender, passer, and he works hard at both ends of  the floor.  <br />Mike's corporate poster boy behavior is laughable.  He did  ads for AT&amp;T and then MCI.  The Wayans family is also split between the  two companies.  Mike talked about the enviroment in Rayovac ads and then  pitches hot dogs?  Mike is not the only athlete who will pitch anything and  everything to make millions.  I wonder if Mike has checked into Nike's  labor practices.<br />Players like Mike and Charles Barkley soured me on  the  NBA.  Charles played like a thug and got away with it because he was a  star.  Plus, Charles insisted on wearing number 34 at Philadelphia  eventhough it was retired for NBA great Billy Cunningham.  The star  treatment and inflated egos has grown old, and that has turned a lot of  people off to sports.  I miss the Lakers and Celtics match ups of the  1980s.
I have mixed feelings about Michael Jordan.  On the one hand, he is a great athlete.  I respect his work ethic.  He has turned in a number of great performances and is no doubt one of the greatest to have ever played the game of basketball.<br />There is a flipside.  Michael Jordan got all  kinds of special treatment while he was in the NBA.  He was the first  player I noticed who was granted all kinds of trips to the charity stripe  because of unbelievably, ticky tack calls.  He scored at least ten points a  game at the free throw line from bogus calls.  It was great when there was  a picture session for 'greats of the game' with Larry Bird, Magic Johnson,  and Michael Jordan.  Magic told Larry not to stand too close to Michael or  they might call a foul.  In front of reporters and television viewers, that  was a classic comment by Magic.  I believe Mike got 99% of all calls in his  favor because he was such a cash cow for the NBA.  Dominique Wilkins was  robbed of a slam dunk championship when Mike scored a perfect 50 doing the  same dunk Dr. J did years before.  I doubt Dr. J ever received a perfect 50  for it.  Dominique's dunk was much more impressive, and he received a 49.5.   Please.  Mike got in a fight with Reggie Miller, and only Miller got  suspended at first.  Only after there was an outcry did Mike get suspended.   How are Mike's punches different?  Mike elbowed Kevin Johnson to the  ground for all to see, and Kevin was called for blocking! <br />I am not too  impressed that the bulls beat the lakers in the NBA finals.

I have read &quot;The Creature from Jekyll Island&quot; and &quot;Secrets of the Temple&quot; and &quot;The Creature from Jekyll Island&quot; is an easier read and is more on point.  This book gave life to suspicions I had  in high school and covered points I had not previously thought of.  One of  the author's strengths is his ability to go very in depth with this topic  without getting overly artsy and ambiguous with his writing.  I would like  to comment on a couple of reviews on this book before I finish my own.  My  comments are not meant as a personal attack against these individuals.   They can say what they want.  However, I believe some of their comments are  misleading and hurt both author and potential reader unfairly.<br />Greg Whyte  goes after the author for not having a balanced and objective view.  The  establishment has had their say, and the author can go after the FED  however he pleases.  The author clearly outlines several valid reasons why  the FED should be abolished.  This reviewer also accuses the author of  using falsehoods, innuendos, and misinterpreted statistics, but this same  reviewer does not give one example nor does this reviewer tell us where to  do proper, independent research we should do.<br />Clint says the bankers  should have had a say.  I agree.  All of them and not just a few of the  wealthiest.  The men at Jekyll Island did not go there on behalf of the  entire banking industry.  This reviewer also wonders who is actually  cheating the public: Is the author cheating the public with his documented  and clearly written book or is it the  the media, FED friendly politicians,  and Alan Greenspan, who was against fiat money until seeing the FED's  &quot;Help Wanted&quot; sign, cheating the public?  <br />A reader from  Prescott AZ says that the danger is the raising of interest rates  eventhough the author details several other dangers of the FED throughout  the book.  Also, check your own loss of purchase power with FED funnymoney.  One does not have to work in banking to study the FED.  Also, the  author highlights activities of government leaders and the FED in the  book.<br />The solution at the end of the book is very well thought out and a  great way to end the book.  Putting the financial destiny of the world in  the hands of a few big bankers is bad news no matter how you slice it.  Mr.  Griffin outlines this with great precision in his book.  The Federal  Reserve and any other mechanism like it must be eliminated.  There are  other ways to make a difference with this issue as well.  I will return  with more on that later, maybe.
