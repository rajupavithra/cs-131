First novel based in the South where a group of women meet over coffee and  desert.  As tragic conditions hit their lives, they grow closer together.   I was happy to see church provided in a real way in the life of these  women.  I hope to see more from this new author.  I recommend it to all to  read.

I have used several titles for reference including the Microsoft Step-by-Step series.  Using Access 97 answered questions on filters in a few minutes that I wasted hours on in other titles.  If you can have only one title for your reference library, this is the one.
Not the best of the series, but definetly a good read.  Well worth the purchase price.
Lilly Bard is one of the best women detectives out there.  Better series than Aurora Teagarden.  The character and the plot are much darker than previous books.  Author tackles issues of violence and rape which are reoccuring themes - see A Secret Rage.
Charlaine Harris has joined the ranks of one of the top five female mystery writers.  This is her best book so far.  Love Lilly Bard!
Having escaped fundamentalism and now a Christian, it was wonderful to read a book that expresses the theological extremism of American fundamentalism.
Very enjoyable mystery series, especially those that enjoy women protagonists.  Southern setting and sensibilities are also fun to read.
