My experience was quite the contrary; I enjoyed it more than any other school reading. This book is a very interesting read that is well written and easy to understand. Highly recommended for anyone interested in ancient cultures or theology.	2005-09-01

After reading what Orson Scott Card and David Farland had to say about it i decided to give Brandon Sanderson a chance and so I bought the book. I found the beginning chapters to be very captivating and provoking. The author set up a world that was nothing like any other world i had ever read about. He doesn't bog down the reader with lenghty descriptions but allows you to gain an image of the world over time and throughout the entire book. <br />I was immediatly drawn in by the plot and literally could not put the book down. I started reading about 10 am and read until 3 am.   I will admit that the second quarter of the book felt a little slow but not to slow to get my to stop reading.  <br />I loved the complex problems that Sanderson created in the book and seeing the intrigue and plotting that was going on in the book. It came to a point when i began to fear that Sanderson had created to big of a problem for him to solve. I have read far too many books where the author cannot create an interesting and plausible ending for his book. However, Sanderson did it. This book pulls it off, just when i thought everything had lots controlled, Sanderson showed that he knew exactly what was going on and how he was going to solve his problem.  <br /> <br />I loved this book and felt satisified upon reading it. <br />If you are looking for a fun book to read that at the same time will introduce some interesting ideas choose this book. <br />Elantris is by far the best book i have read in years.	2005-08-02

Dave Gibbons illustrations are quite complementary to the text. It looks, and feels similar to most superhero comics of the 80's. Yet, what sets it apart is the epic scope that Moore creates with the incorparation of historical fiction, and turning two dimensional superheroes into three dimensional human beings. The annotations at the end of every chapter also help add depth to a world that your are instantly catapulted into from the very first page.<br /><br />  Watchmen is simply captivating. This book seems way a head of it's time. I'm glad that I read the book for the first time as a young adult. If I had read it as a child, I don't think I would have possessed the cognitive skills to undestand and enjoy it at the level that I did. If you've never read any of Alan Moores work, this is a good starting point. I highly recommend it.	2005-09-17

The author takes you into the action quickly making you care about the characters and want to read on. He makes you work a little to figure out what is going on, which makes the plot more interesting and enjoyable. The twists and turns in the book are fascinating and there is rarely a dull moment (if ever). You get so enthralled with it, you don't want to put it down. It's so fun and unique--unlike any other fantasy I've read recently. It has a great prose style that is clear and descriptive, but not overly so. The characters are wonderful and believable and the plot is very smart. It's also nice to know that it is a standalone novel and so we don't get to the end and realize we have to wait for a sequel to find out what happens. I can't wait for the next novel published by Brandon. I'm sure it will be just as great. Orson Scott Card has given it wonderful reviews as well and he is one of the greatest scifi/fantasy writers of the past few decades!	2005-06-02

In teaching US History, World History, Civics, Sociology, or Leadership, a lesson on Lafayette is a must!  Unger skillfully presents a comparison/contrast on Lafayette and Washington, American Revolution and French Revolution.  Question:  Why did republicanism work so early in America and take so long to work in France?  One reason is that representative government began early in colonial America, with village governments and colonial assemblies.  France did not have that foundation but was ruled by despots, the people being forced to submit. If Lafayette had a fault, it was naivete.  He did not understand the significance of the foundation of representative government in America which France lacked. Another reason was Washington, Lafayette, Greene and others in the military and Adams, Madison, Jefferson, Franklin and others in the political realm.  These Americans' focus was a team effort (militarily and politically) to \\"form a more perfect Union\\" for the benefit of all the people.  In France, the focus on the part of many was \\"me first\\" or \\"what's in it for me\\" or \\"how can I protect my interests.\\"  The cynics are so quick to point fingers at USA government.  It is true--America is not perfect, but America was the first to implement liberty, freedom, and democracy.  Through all the growing pains and revisions, we have done rather well.  After reading Unger's book, I will never look on the US flag the same again.  I will have much greater respect for Old Glory than ever before! All these thoughts have come to mind while reading Unger's book on Lafayette--a must read!	2005-05-30

I felt this book was more about being different; whether it be as an angel, a schizophrenic, or physically handi-capped. It's about coming to terms with what your are and moving forward.  The romance near the end, said to me, when you accept yourself good things come your way. <br />     I also enjoyed the commentaries on prejudice and how a cause and political correctness can be carried to far.  Creating a whole new set of problems and discomfort. This is a great read! <br />	2005-09-15

The books basic premis is that Eve is sent on a mission and has to team up with an Angel in order to catch a spiritual serial killer. The Idea sounded really great and the book went along great until the end. Here is where it dies for me. Eve has to catch this spirit of this serial killer which has envaded the body of a family friend. She gets to go see her daughter and has a vrey piongnent Mother Daughter moment. Eve realizes that she cant stay with her daughter and that she needed to move on.  I thnik that in the action the story got lost and it felt like she was just trying to give a happy ending. There was however a very nice teaser at the back of the book for the next in the series.	2005-08-01
US	13990923	R2FJV6CZLMU31O	0399152806	739064537	Superstition	Books	2	13	18	N	Y	Disappointed	I was really disappointed with Karen Robards latest tale. I have read ALL of her books and I have never been disappointed before. Neither one of the characters did it for me, especially Nicky. She was just a little bit too gungho, ruthless and kinda pushy. She was also either stupid or had a death wish seeing as how she just didn't seem to care all that much about her welfare during most of the book. She kept taking crazy chances and came back to the island where she was attacked and almost killed all in the name of her job. It's great that she was ambitious and wanting to further her career, but that chick needed a help group for workaholics. Also I didn't like the way the story touched on the fact that she had psychic abilities as a child, but repressed them and then when she experienced psychic phenomena as an adult it went nowhere and wasn't mentioned again. The logical conclusion to that(to me at least)is that she would have once again begun to have psychic visions and such, being that she was no longer repressing and was pretty well open to the whole seeing ghosts thing. The whole plot just didn't seem well thought out and the ending was just a little to quick also.	2005-06-08
